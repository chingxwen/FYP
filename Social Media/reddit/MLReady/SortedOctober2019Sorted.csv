I was never made aware of why this color change occurred and the Galaxy Buds were still in stock in white online. This didn\'t make sense to me, so I called customer service back about this. They said it was simply a mistake, so I sent back the yellow pair for a white pair. Unfortunately, two weeks later, I recieved yet another yellow pair. This absolutely made no sense. I called back again the day those arrived and told Customer Service the issue. They said they would escalate this situation. A few days later, I was called by someone higher up in the customer service department who apologized profusely about this and agreed to send me a white pair. They said it would definitely be white this time and said it would arrive in a few business days. This brings us to today, nearly THREE WEEKS later (so much for their ""fastest shipping""), where the earbuds arrive again. Yellow. A third time.

We finally just sent the phone in to be looked at and they called and said that the device was not under warranty because it's water damaged...the phone is water resistant!? she hasn't taken it into water, she does wipe her phone down a lot because she has OCD but that is ridiculous to think that cleaning it has caused enough water damage to prevent fast charge from working. So when it came back I took things into my own hands.

2019-10-13,"[""Hey all, Contemplating a new phone purchase this year to celebrate a contract extension and also because it's been about 2 years with my old phone. An S10 is something I was thinking about but one thing I've heard about / experienced(current phone is LG) with non Google phones is that most companies tend to be pretty slow on updating their phones; that being said, for all the long-time Galaxy / Note owners - how has Samsung been with regards to things like security updates? Feature updates would be great... but honestly that's less important than having security updates delivered in a reasonably timely fashion. &amp;#x200B; As a side note - I was considering an iPhone 11 too, given the new cameras + added battery life + being able to trade in an old testing device, I'm pretty certain I'll end up sticking with Android but if anyone had thoughts on that, that'd be great to hear too.

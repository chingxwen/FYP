2019-07-01,"['First off, I\'m pretty tech savvy, but I just can\'t seem to fix this problem. At first I had my tv connected via HDMI Arc to my Vizio 5.1 sound bar, and NO MATTER WHAT tv audio setting I had it in, it would constantly cut of audio for a second or so every 1 - 5 minutes.. it was insanely frustrating. It especially would cut off when I had it on Dolby Digital.. the ONLY settings that it would cut off less on was when I had both audio settings on my tv set to PCM, but then the audio was kind of blurry, as in it was harder to really make out what words where being spoken. And yes, I\'ve done ALL the factory resets on the sound bar already. I even purchased a new HDMI cable and the same thing happened. My tv is new also. I then tried my Xbox 360\'s Netflix app, and same thing happened. SO, I switched over to optical and again audio skipping on Dolby digital output on my tv just.. less skipping than on HDMI Arc. SO I bought a new optical cable, and the same thing happened. So, now.. last resort, I switch my audio settings to PCM and PCM and somehow that almost fully worked.. now instead of second long skipping every 1 - 5 minutes, it\'s about one time every hour or so. Better, but no. I want NO skipping, ever. I am not willing to settle, considering the amount I paid for this sound bar. This entire time I was testing it with the built in Samsung Netflix app, which I heard was glitchy with sound bars... so... could THAT be it? After finding that out online, I went to Netflix in my Xbox 360 which is connected via HMDI (not Arc) to my tv, So the Xbox 360\'s audio is now going to my tv, and from my tv to the sound bar via Optical. You know whats been confusing me forever? My Samsung tv has TWO audio settings... almost everybody has just one from what I\'ve seen online.. HDMI Input Audio Format, the options are: PCM and Bitstream and I also have Digital Output Audio Format, the options are: PCM, Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital+ (Which my sound bar doesn\'t accept) DTS (Which never seems to be selectable, it\'s just greyed out), and DTS Neo 2:5 (Which is always selectable, but I hate how it sounds, so I\'ve avoided that one... I haven\'t tried it on optical yet though, just HDMI Arc.) I need to be clearly explained what are the differences and purposes between the HDMI Input Audio Format and the Digital Output Audio Format.. What do they both individually do, and in HDMI Input Audio Format what is the difference between Bitstream and PCM? What do they both do? ....OK so I set the HDMI Input Audio Format to Bitstream and the Digital Output Audio Format to PCM. and the Xbox 360\'s audio settings are: Digital Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby Digital with WMA Pro ...and I set it to Dolby Digital 5.1 and it actually didn\'t skip... BUT after an hour of everything going good, I was watching Avengers Endgame and an anime with the Netflix setting set to English (5.1) and it didn\'t skip for a second.. but the volume instead, lowered itself for a second. Which is why I said it ""dimmed"" in the title.. which is... weird.. and still unacceptable. Again, I want it to work perfectly. But.. I do actually LOVE the way PCM on Digital Output Audio Format sounds via Optical.. It\'s so raw and clear and doesn\'t sound so ""edited"". It feels like I\'m in a theater listening to the sound the way it was intended to be heard.. it even sounds better to me than dolby digital via HMDI Arc, which makes it sound like I\'m listen to the movie through over priced headphones that slightly over ""edit"" the sound slightly instead of leaving the sound the way the sound engineers intended it to be listened to.. but that\'s just my personal opinion from what I hear.. So I love PCM via optical and am hoping I can keep it, (Though, Ill happily use Dolby Digital if I can get it to work perfectly) but at this point? I just want to find SOME setting that will just work and never skip or dim in audio that allows me to get 5.1 surround sound no matter what. 5.1 surround sound is also very important to me considering I payed extra for a sound bar just to get 5.1 instead of a way cheaper 2.0 sound bar.. so I would like to retain those features if possible, while getting the best sound I can. So NOW, I changed the HDMI Input Audio Format to PCM on my tv.. and am going to watch something else again on Netflix as a test with all the settings the same except for that one change.. Both the HDMI Input Audio Format and the Digital Output Audio Format is set to PCM now via Optical, with the Netflix setting set to English (5.1) I\'ll update, to see what happens... This has been about 2 or so months of trial and error, I even replaced the first very same sound bar to see is it was just defective or a dud that I had bought from Walmart online, and the second sound bar that was replaced by Vizio using my warranty WAS skipping way less via HDMI Arc.. but it was still skipping.. which is the sound bar I currently have now. I do think the first sound bar was defective though, this one that I have currently seems to have hope... I. just. need. the. right. audio. settings. I\'m going insane at this point. lol and I\'m going to go even more insane if I have to watch Avengers Infinity War again.. which is the movie I was using to test the sound bars on these last 2 months, because it has the perfect amount of normal volume talking, loud shouting, loud orchestral music, subtle orchestral music, loud explosions, low explosions, subtle sounds, huge battles, normal like every other action movie sounding fight scenes, and basically all the sounds of the average ""movie experience"" all rolled into one movie .. I almost memorized every line.. I\'ve even noticed the CGI mistakes.. the background actors that are smiling when they shouldn\'t be.. the ADR that sounds out of place.. this sound bar has made me sick of Infinity War.. and I used to love that movie. Great. Thanks Vizio sound bar. lol OH and to add upon that I also have an android tv box that I have no idea what settings to set it to. I am thinking about buying an Xbox One X and using an HDMI splitter to send all of my HDMI devices through my Xbox One X and then connect my optical cable to the back of the Xbox One X to send all of my audio to my sound bar.. BUT.. I\'m ify on that, as I don\'t want my Xbox One to be on all day long just because I want to watch a device that\'s connected through it... you know? Also, what audio settings would I need to put on my Xbox One X to make it work perfectly with my sound bar in the future? Just out of curiosity? Oh and my Wii is connected via component cables to the back of my Samsung tv, and it cuts off audio ALOT with optical as well.. about every 1 - 5 minutes, regardless of what audio option I give it.. It only works fine when I convert the wii RCA red and white cables audio to 3.5mm and plug it into the 3.5mm input on my sound bar.. THEN it works and doesn\'t skip... also no my tv doesn\'t have a 3.5 mm output or an RCA output for some dumb reason.. I\'m stuck with and limited to either HDMI Arc or Optical.. and so far optical seems to be the ONLY ONE that is giving me semi hope here. Can someone give me exact settings to set everything to to make this all work? I really don\'t want to have to rely on an Xbox One.. Also can some explain to me what these settings mean? I HAVE google searched them, but the explanations always seem so vague, and usually the tvs they give explanation examples with never have HDMI input Audio Format... JUST Digital Output Audio Format.. which makes things even more confusing to understand what I\'m working with. I have a slight vague idea of everything, but nothing clearly explained to me yet.. I need to know what I\'m working with to find a solution. In all, money is really tight right now, and I\'m hoping that I don\'t have to end up returning this and buying something more expensive in the end.. All help I can get is very much appreciated. Thanks to everyone in advance! and sorry for writing so much, but I really had no choice if I wanted to explain everything clearly.

So I immediately hit the emergency switch, and put it under my vent upside down with the A/C on. It's the next day.

So 3 days ago I decided to try the built-in screen recording on galaxy s9+ (Built-in screen recording is found in devices that have game tools software, which can be found in the navigation bar when a game or a supported app is currently in use). I set the recording settings to 1080p recording internal sound without using mic. After recording it and watching it, I noticed that the recording is going around 25-30 fps, while the game while it was recording was going on 60 fps. I tried doing it on 760p, and it recorded it at 60 fps with no problems. Meaning that 1080p has an issue and does not record at the amount of fps I was experiencing in the game. So I was wondering if this was indeed a bug on this version of game tools or if it is only my phone that has this issue.. because it seems like samsung doesn\'t know anything else other than ""factory reset your phone"". Please tell me that it is a bug in game tools so I can relief myself and not send my phone for 2 weeks to samsung just for them to say that they fixed it without actually doing anything to it.

After leaving my Galaxy J5 2017 in November of last year to get a Nokia 7 plus and having it stolen around one week ago, I had to come back to that J5 temporarily with plans of getting another phone. I was really impressed with it (and I was ""crying"" over coming back to Samsung a few momths after I got that 7+ anyway), and henceforth I am planning on getting a Samsung phone again, also given that I have the Galaxy Buds and a Gear S3. I settled on the S10 or S10e (my dad has a S10+ taken with a pre-order, which is also the source for my Buds) because of my hefty demands with a phone TL;DR I think the S10e is kinda more suited for me, because of the flat screen and the compact design (I\'ve tested it, not the S10, I\'ll test it in an hour), but I am concerned about the overall performance, the cameras, and that in-display fingerprint sensor of the S10 seems cool These my criteria of selecting a phone: - high performance. I play pubg, not expecting ultra-high graphics, but I want it to run smoothly. Also I am quite a heavy user (lots of Music via Bluetooth and YouTube, also the pubg). I don\'t think it\'s an issue with any of those two...right? - battery life to be good to great. I expect charghing it only during night, but something more than this is obviously welcome - I like the flat screen on the S10e. However, is the curved display that bad on the S10? - I want an ultra-wide camera, but heard the S10e has that too, the telephoto being the one missing? - not that big of a phone. The S10+ is just as big as the 7+ so the normal one should be smaller. I\'ve seen the e, it\'s very compact and I might see it a bit to small, but I kind of think the normal one would be a more balanced option - preferably a dedicated MicroSD slot, but I think none of them has that - stereo speakers (those are a must) - they both come with a plastic screen preotectorz right?

Just a black screen, totally unresponsive to any key presses or reset tricks, no vibration, no blue light of any kind, unresponsive to the charger being plugged in and my computer doesn't recognise it anymore, it's practically turned into a paper weight. &amp;#x200B; Any idea's/suggestions what it might be or if it's even fixable?""]",0.077,0.833,0.09,0.6789

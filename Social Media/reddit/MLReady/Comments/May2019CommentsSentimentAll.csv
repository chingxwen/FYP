Yes, I called Verizon technical support, and Verizon even got in contact with Samsung, only to have Verizon tell me that feature was never available for that model phone. The help technician double-checked with me regarding the capability of changing display modes for home screens, app screens, and I confirmed I could do it with the previous phone. She seemed confused. So was I, as I clearly remember being able to flip the phone to landscape in home screen mode. Did I miss something? Is there a feature or setting I'm completely overlooking?

They told me to use 5G for all of my streaming. I've been using an older smart TV with limited capabilities so I just use a Chromecast for all of my streaming. Got it set up, used it for a few days with no issues whatsoever, but my TV suddenly died. It was a Vizio something or other that I traded an ex for when he moved out. • Anyway, now I need a new TV and I would like a nice smart TV with apps built in so I don't have to juggle apps on my phone and Chromecast all the time. BUT, I've noticed some popular smart TVs aren't 5G compatible (nearly bought a Samsung but noticed the complaints online). How do I know if a TV is 5G compatible? It doesn't say in the specs on Best Buy or Walmart's websites. Googling just brings up complaints from people trying to connect who are realizing the TV they just bought isn't compatible. • My second question is if I got one of these Samsung TVs that isn't compatible with 5G, can I just use a Chromecast and have the Chromecast and my phone connected to the 5G and not my TV? I'm assuming that my old smart TV wasn't 5G compatible but I never connected the TV to the internet, just the Chromecast. But could that be what killed it? I'm thinking my internet provider should have warned us about this, but I barely know anything about this lol.... Any help would be greatly appreciated.

With Android pie and Samsung One, Android has a much more premium feel to it. I have to admit I was not a big fan of Lolipop. Transfering data from your phone will be easy as Samsungs ship with a wire that you just connect and it all transfers within an hour. You can also transfer things to or from your Android just by dragging them from your PC. That is literally the biggest thing that made me switch and I love it. Samsungs also have multi tasking, so you can have two apps on your screen at a time. You can watch Youtube in the background and it even works with some music video.(Not with all) You don't need all of your apps on the home screen. a lot nicer than Siri, even if it's ui isn't as nice imo. You can also put widgets on the home screen, (I sort of miss the ios widget page) or make blank home screens to enjoy your wallpaper. File management is a dream, just make new folders and drag files around with your PC. You have a standard USB-C charger that lasts longer. The phones are all much better value. (AAt least with the S Series, idk about Note) The 128 gb Samsung is 50 dollars cheaper than the iPhone XR and has a better screen, the 512GB S10 is 200 dollars cheaper than the 256GB XS, and the 512gb S10+ is 300 dollars cheaper than the XS Max. &amp;#x200B; There are some downsides to Samsung and Android. From what I hear Samsung is terribly slow with updates. The RAM management is shit. My phone has 6gbs and just sitting at the home screen takes up half of it. When you have several apps open in the background it really really really shows. That's all I have really noticed. I might find out more as time goes on.""]",0.053,0.8759999999999999,0.071,0.8081

If that’s your approach, save your money and stay with Apple. If however you are going to embrace the Chang, be willing to change daily workflows and usage.

Bixby is completely unobtrusive across my device. I don't use it at all and its never once been opened accidentally, it doesn't push notifications to me, I don't have the panel to the left of the home screen turned on. 3. Bixby isn't designed to replace anything. Google voice assistant has it's own hardware button on the phones, holding in the pressure sensitive home button engages it. What it's designed to do is operate within the bounds of the Samsung ecosystem, using Samsung's well established smart devices, such as refrigerators, dishwashers, washing machines, TVs, stereos, etc. 4. The app suite isn't a copy of anything. Its an alternative to Google services. Personally, I don't use many of them, however I do use the calendar, notes, email, and internet. I do this for the simple reason of, I can set up adblockers, I avoid using Google services as much as possible to preserve my online privacy. 5. The use case for the sort of things you're describing is very narrow and specific. People will buy a case with an air quality sensor due to, as a simplification, 2 reasons: they have a reason to doubt their air quality and it's a cheap/convenient method of doing so. This is great, and it's a clever implementation of tech. A purpose built sensor with purpose built software is going to be cheaper to develop than as a feature on an already expensive device. Samsung's flagships use the best screens, processors, and other parts available. This eats into development budget. 6. With several billion dollars behind you, you could make a feature-rich phone that I have no doubt would be a great device to use, if you had any intelligence. However, could you market it, produce it and make a profit on it while listening to investors and directors and management? I doubt it. Risk-taking in technology has become less mainstream due to the dropping in profits over the last year or so in the smartphone market, particularly in the premium ranges. This isn't Samsung specific. 7. Yep, note phones are the best in the world for productivity, nothing like them, nothing as well implemented as them. 8. You can uninstall it. You can wipe your entire device and install a custom ROM. Nobody is stopping you.

I've tried around 6 different Bluetooth earbud sets, ranging from cheap Amazon brands to beatsx. Everything seems to connect and use a shitty codec, usually SBC but one or two use AAC and still have garbled sound. doesn't seem to matter what the advertised codec or Bluetooth revision is. This is backed up by the fact that I can't change the codec in the developer options, and by the fact that when I pair these same devices to my old iPhone 5s, the sound quality is fine, no garbling, no disconnects, volume is fine etc. this goes for all tested devices except one of the cheap Amazon brands which sounded bad on both devices, and the beatsx which sound good on both but are a much older model and don't work in other ways. (disconnects, resetting pairing, doesn't hold a charge etc.) I use Bluetooth earbuds every day at work and frequently in my non work life, and I've had this note 9 for about 6 months now and I'm starting to question if I should keep it. I ordered some new Galaxy buds that will be here sometime this week, if those work and sound good and I'm happy then I may stick with them and the note. just curious if anyone has any insight on this because it severely limits the value of this expensive phone for me. curious if it's a Samsung thing, a note 9 thing, an android thing, or what. because I have considered a pixel phone and I even entertain switching back to whatever iPhone they come out with this year.

431,2019-05-09,"[""I personally love the curved screen. Every screen is fragile, so this is too, but if you get a screen protector that shouldn't be an issue. The curved screen also nearly completely eliminates the side bezels, as it wraps around where they would usually be, giving a fuller and more immersive view. There is a glare on the curves, but imo it actually looks nice. When using the phone, they way that things kind of flow off of the screen when you swipe gives it a really unique and interesting look. When watching Fullscreen video, you can see a slight difference in color from the main screen and the curves (just because of how OLED looks from an angle), but I don't think it impacts the viewing experience at all. If anything it makes it look a little better to me. The curved screen also adds an interesting functionality; the edge screen. This means you can swipe from the very edge if the screen and bring up a panel of apps (that you choose), quick actions, your music, the weather, calendar, etc. This works on a flat screen, but I think with a case on a flat screen phone it's very difficult to access. I didn't think it was going to be something if actually use, but I put my most used apps there, and now I use it all the time. People also talk about accidental touches. I use a very thin clear case, and I have only accidentally touched the edge 5 times at most since I've had the phone. If you have a case, you most likely won't have accidental touches, and if you do, there's an app in Goodlock (goodlock is a group of Samsung apps for extra customization) that can add dead zones to the edges so you don't accidentally touch the edges. The curved screen also works great with a screen protector. Plastic and glass both work fine, the biggest difference is that the glass needs to have a LOCA application in order to work with the fingerprint sensor underneath the screen. I've applied two Whitestone dome screen protectors to my S10+, and it looks and works great, and doesn't hinder my fingerprint sensor at all. Speaking of the fingerprint sensor, I know some people are going to say that the sensor under the glass is bad and/or doesn't work well. That's mostly not true. A lot of people never had any issues with it in the first place, and for people who did have issues with it, it got a few updates and now works even better, even with screen protectors.""]",0.062,0.848,0.09,0.9405

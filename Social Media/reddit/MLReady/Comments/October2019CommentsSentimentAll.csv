Personally I use mostly Samsung apps. The Samsung browser, for example, is way better than Chrome. It uses Chromium engine, has a better night mode (no sudden bright white loading/splash screens), anti tracking/ad blocking extensions, and can sync bookmarks to any Chromium based browser or Firefox on a desktop/laptop. It can also be used as the device assistant with a customizable search engine of choice. Google Photos is great in it has unlimited photo backup. I don't use it personally because I realize I'll just end up with a metric ton of photos there. I keep them just backed up on Samsung cloud so I can better manage them from growing too many and delete from time to time.

Also, airpods don't encapsulate sound very much, they're pretty loose in the ear, so wearing them everywhere is possible because someone can talk to you and you can hear them. Samsung buds on the other hand encapsulate very well. The rubber nub on the earbud keeps the sound in very well, and makes it hard for your experience to be disturbed by ambient noise, and even loud noise. For this reason, there is a setting that lets the bud mix in ambient sound while you're using them (through the existing mic on the bud) which makes it LESS encapsulated, but only when you choose. They're also quite inconspicuous when in your ear.

The product was hailed as groundbreaking by the Samsung company because of its stronger RAM, processing power and the ability to give the user a strong experience. But now, the product has to be vetted for one major factor, and that is, the battery of Samsung Note 10. The Samsung Note 10 has a battery life of 9 to 10 hours a day and is considered some of the highest battery times the brand has provided in recent history. Now, here we come with the breakdown of various other time frames that are significant in assessing the quality of the product. **LTE 2.0Gbps:** Samsung launched the Exynos 9 Series 9820 Processor that takes the 2.0 Gbps LTE Advanced Pro Modem that the company is taking great pride in. The product has the neural processing unit (NPU) which is a greatly advanced processing system. Android works with the artificially intelligent system that focuses on the intelligent learning of the patterns that the person follows and developing an android’s behavioral pattern that will cater to the user’s pattern of thinking. This will make sure that the device runs smoothly and will also troubleshoot issues that occur due to over usage of the same few features over and over again. **PROCESSOR 7nm:** NM in this context is nanometer, the thickness of the transistors used in the androids is of 7nm and the product will have the 7nm of transistor capacity. This will make the CPU considerably powerful and will make the product easier to use. The processing power means that even though the product has multiple heavy-handed features, the processor can handle the burden and will make the product quickly. The Note10 has been in the market for a year now and the product does not hang that often. **RAM 12GB:** The RAM in [Note 10 plus]( is 12 GB and this is the main reason that the device has such power. Usually, the products cannot even offer a 10GB RAM of processing speed by the Processor with 7nm of transistor potential combined with the 12 GB of RAM will give you a device that will run like a horse. No matter how heavy your products are, you will have a successful device that does not hang up usually. **Internal Storage:** The device has an internal storage of 512 GB that is a stronger internal storage capacity than most of the laptops and computers that are available in the market. The reason is that the internal storage in this device is designed to allow the user to download heavy tv shows and similar content so that they can enjoy the content on the Hi-definition android. These are the main reasons you should have Note 10 on your next shopping list. This is a great product for you and your family.

I can only install Whatsapp, Google Maps, Saavn and a couple of apps in that storage. Whatsapp takes up a big chunk of storage though (70-80 MB), compared to other Gingerbread apps, that take only 10-15 MB each! 290MB RAM! And just a 3.0 inch 240x320 display, which is miniature by today's standards but was big back then, compared to from where I was coming from - Nokia feature phones! It still runs! I use it as a Music Player though - it has some pretty perfect sound tuning and DAC that even puts recent Android phones from Chinese manufacturers to shame.

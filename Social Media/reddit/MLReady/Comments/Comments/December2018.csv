1,"I bought the new Galaxy Watch, used it for 2 days and returned it. Also kept pausing my workout when running. Not sure if the vibration or shaking was causing it to do that but I was severely let down. Also the fact that it only runs on Samsung Messages so Google Messages didn't work.

Those apps usually are targeting an old version of Android that did not support 18:9 ratio screens.

Now that almost every phone has an 18:9 screen, you will see less and less of that. However, outdated apps will continue to have this. It is a problem Google is trying to fix by forcing support for later versions of Android to be on the Play Store.

Meaning its actually safer to use Samsung Pay rather than your actual card. It will use a random 16 digit number each time! I run into people who think you are more susceptible to identity theft, but the tokenization protects your personal information. It's also great because you earn rewards and can cash them out for Samsung prizes. I use Samsung Pay daily and love having interaction with the fruit companies users. ",2018-11-30 16:33:45

29,"So, hi. 

&amp;#x200B;

We know. S-Voice was never designed to be a proper voice assistant. It was built and put into product roadmaps as a way to do text-to-speech commands, like ""Call mom"" or ""Send a text"". Those functions are basic requirements for the hardware category, so if Bixby wasn't ready or couldn't be supported by hardware planned for 1-2 years out, it got S-Voice, which was developed many years ago. Retrofitting Bixby onto those devices is, unfortunately, lower priority than trying to make it work well on the primary devices (i.e. phone and TV). Samsung is big, but it doesn't have infinite time and resources.

&amp;#x200B;

As for Bixby, the plan is eventually for everything to have it. Watches, TV, fridge, all connected to the same voice assistant, tied to your Samsung Account and Samsung Cloud. All talking to each other, subtly learning in the background when to turn on lights, what Youtube videos to suggest in your feed, etc. But Bixby was basically rebuilt after the S8 when Viv ([http://viv.ai/](http://viv.ai/) ) was integrated, so when specs and roadmap for various products were being design,  the choice was either put the 1.0 version of Bixby into the Galaxy Watch, Iconx, etc, only for them to be obsolete and out of step with the New Bixby on the phone by the time they came out, or to focus efforts on a single experience for the next generation. We chose the latter. If you watch DJ Koh's presentation at our developer's conference, that's the vision he laid out.

&amp;#x200B;

Other ecosystems aren't exactly nailing this right now either. Trying to set an alarm on a Google Home vs on your phone will show you that they don't interact at all. Siri is just a straight up mess between the Apple TV, Watch, and HomePod (which is missing the vast majority of functionality). No one uses Alexa on their phones, even if they use it daily on their Echo. Etc. Everyone is about a generation behind where consumers want us to be.

You will have an option to turn your galaxy into a mini computer if you stick it in a DeX pad/station.

Also, s9 has newer software and get update longer than s8. As you are using ipX, you will find samsung has more option to customise your phone (font size/style, home screen lay out, wallpaper,... Etc). You can multi-task on your phone (split screen in 2 and using 2 apps at the same time). 

However, you will get lag and stuttering sometimes because s8 or even s9 chip (especially exynos version, which much likely you will get in UK) is way inferior to apple A11 chip. You can make your phone smoother by unlock developer options and scale down animation time. ",2018-12-01 05:43:12

When we (my family and I) went to get our first smartphones we were set on iPhones because we were familiar with the OS through owning an iPod touch. The S3 had recently been released and the employees at the Verizon store had suggested we take a look at the S3. Boom, we were sold! The customizability was fascinating, and it was easier to use (surprisingly) compared to the iPhone. 

The S3 wasn't perfect, but Samsung has continued to improve and I'll absolutely be a customer for life.

Also turning the option to split window every app in developer options so you can split window the apps that aren't allowed.

- Customisation is great (my favorite thing about android) watch some videos and learn how to use KWLP and KWGT and look at some set ups and you can completely change the way you use your phone.

- Themes, I use a full amoled dark one which is 100% better than the white background and what everyone on r/apple is begging for. If you get the Samsung experience 10 one from XDA (one I use) it also changed 90% of stock apps to black plus the look and layout of things.
You can also change the font, I'm currently using a Google Sans one that I recently downloaded from XDA and it looks great.

- Goodlock. 100% recommend. Another customisation app and it has capabilities to change most of the UI by the way it looks and customising the colors of the notification and system tray for example.

•Enjoy downloading outside of the app store, but be careful. Get all the free tv, music, movies you want, plus apps that got pulled from the store. You can use AVG free (antivirus, seems the least intrusive), and I'd  be careful with torrent apps if your not familiar. Your ISP or carrier could send you a naughty note, or kick you off. If you stream movies, you're in the clear.
•Use Samsung Pay. You might as well get free stuff for money you are already spending, and its secure. If your bank card isn't supported, you can add your PayPal. You're gonna get alot of ""We don't take Apple Pay"", but Samsung Pay uses MST so it will work almost anywhere you can swipe. Always select credit on the pay station, you've already pinned in on the phone.
•Set up secure folder. If you use your phone for work/personal, it's a good way to seperate your gallery, email apps, notes, etc. Or, maybe, you just want to hide shit. You can use it for that too. You hide or disguise the icon. You can also set up a dedicated fingerprint for it, so one finger opens the regular home, and the other opens secure folder. It also has a self destruct if passcode is entered incorrectly too many times.
•Bixby works....if you work on it. I feel like people complain about it, but mine works great. It's as smart as you make it though. If you ""teach"" it when it understands incorrectly or does the wrong command, it learns and corrects. If you don't, it won't. Mine is doing three-chain commands like a pro now, but I used and taught it. Quick Commands are awesome!
•Connect to a PC? Use Samsung Flow. Transfer stuff back and forth quickly (uses WiFi Direct for large files), unlock PC from your phone with biometrics.

One of the reasons I went with the S9 instead of buying a beater phone till the S10 release was that the S10 is supposed to come with all sorts of new technology and after some thinking, I realized I didn't want to be to the test subject for Samsung and would rather pick up the odd number Galaxies so they can work out the kinks.

The S8 sold for the same price as the S9 during their releases so I can only assume it would be the same or similar for the S10 and the S11. Just me personally would rather buy a phone with the kinks worked out in exchange for the hip factor of having the newest tech.",2018-12-02 03:52:19

AFAIK the Tab S3 and the Tab S4 are the only tablets that come with a stylus. You could always get a capacitive stylus as that'll work with any tablet so you'll have a a bit more choice.

The Tab E is an old Samsung tablet which is about 4 years old so I wouldn't consider that.

134,"If you Google something like ""different Samsung tablet series"" you'll probably find some comparisons, but really all you need to know is that S series is the flagship, A is mid-tier, E lower-end. If stylus is a must then your options will be limited to just a few models (note that while capacitive styli will work with any touch screen they are as accurate as using your finger... AKA useless if you're looking for a pen-and-paper experience). The current S4 will be out of your price range, but the older S3 is definitely a strong contender. There's also a Tab A 10.1 with S-Pen, but that model also comes in a much more widely avalable penless model so if that's something you're interested in buying make sure you're not confusing one model for the other. S-Pens will only work on certain devices because those devices have an additional hardware layer as a screen component, so you can't just buy a random cheapo tablet and hope that an S-Pen will work on it. The Tab A with S-Pen has 3GB of RAM compared to the normal one's 2 GB but other than that (and obviously the higher price for the former) they're basically the same.

140,"My apologies for the necropost, but this was the most relevant thread for me to add to. 

My two cents on the issue is that the S9 likes to throw the moisture error when you're using a non-oem charger. I was using a dollar store cable and an Alcatel 2.0amp wall block, and if I restarted my phone while it was charging, it would give the moisture error. It would make sense that the S9 detects ""moisture"" by detecting an unexpected voltage/amperage/charging abnormality of any sort. Switched to the oem samsung wall block and still using the dollar store cord, and so far so good. 

I do believe this feature is less than perfect, and this won't be everyone's fix, but if all else fails, please try the oem block (and cord, probably).",2018-12-03 22:31:36

180,"Thank you for helping. The mate 20 pro seems to be the better phone on paper, also having even faster quick charging than the samsung, but i feel like the note is the better phone for long term usage. Im really happy about the samsung's headphone jack simce im used to wired headphones a lot. 

Anyway, ONEUI with Android pi should be out in january for the note 9 right? Note 9 also has a better build quality meaning it's more durable than the mate as well as a better screen, regardless of the glass backs on both phones. 

One last thing, the Note 9 in my country is $200 cheaper than the mate 20 pro, is it worth paying an extra $200 for a slightly better performance battery?

187,"I bought a phone recently (got it just yesterday) and my choice was between Huawei P20 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S9+ (not the same, but similar).

Generally speaking, Huawei phones have bigger battery, faster charging, faster updates and usually lower price point. However, I don't like EMUI (their skin on top of Android). It just feels... Chinese. About the camera... A lot of people argue that P20 Pro and Mate 20 Pro have the best cameras out there (they even hold the high score on DxO Mark), but this depends. They take incredible photos, especially at night, but they oversharpen a lot and IMO the photos don't look natural.

Samsung phones have better screen, better build quality, better performance and IMO (and according to a lot of people) better software. Overall they're just better phones - even if they don't stand out that much with a certain feature, they're better all-rounders. However, since you're an Apple user, you might find the Samsung software a bit too alien (Huawei's EMUI is closer to iOS).

I bought the S9+ eventually and I'm super happy. A girl I'm dating bought recently the P20 Pro and I know that if I bought it, I would have made a compromise simply because of the low light camera.

*Edit: Removed the part where EMUI has more features - I'm not actually sure if this is true.*",2018-12-05 00:29:49

189,"not true about battery life, note 9 has better battery life. However the mate charges very much faster, about 30-40 min faster. EMUI, Huawei's skin, is garbage honestly. Samsung experience is better, and one UI even better. you save 200$ and get headphone jack, no notch, better screen, better build, better battery, pen. However, youll have worse camera, slower charging, worse cpu (Huawei's kirin is really good, much better than snapdragon or the exynos.)

Also will mention, the Huawei has better face recognition, Indisplay fingerprint reader (if you care) and note 9 has the fingerprint reader at the back.

I would go with note and I'm not a fan boy by any means. I am an android fan boy and currently use a s7 edge and oneplus 6. ",2018-12-05 01:56:37
190,I'd go with the note 9 not because I'm a Samsung fanboy but because I like Samsungs interface more. I hate the notch on the Huawei aswell as the look on the back. Price is a bit higher on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro aswell ca. 150 euros higher. But if I'd get a new phone I'd probs get a OnePlus phone.,2018-12-05 02:44:30
191,"I have the exact same problem and searched a lot about it.

I think there is no solution to this, unfortunately.

Even changing the subtitles to grey or yellow does not help a lot, on netflix for example you can set the subtitles to be semi-transparent but it only works on SDR content. HDR will ignore this setting and show a full-strong coloured subtitle.

I understand that edge-lit displays do not have the best local dimming of the market but the bright subtitles on very dark scenes ruins the experience. The whole display ""lights up"" when someone speaks and the subtitle appears and then it goes back to the appropriate darkness when no one is speaking (no subtitles).

It's very noticiable and very annoying but I don't think Samsung will do anything about this ever.

All the ""solutions"" that you can find on the internet impact on the HDR performance (lowering the overall backlight, enabling ECO, etc.)

I also have a Q6F and this is my only regret about this TV.

Ozark on Netflix is a great example of the poor handling of subtitles on HDR dark scenes.

If anyone has any trick that minimize this problem please share, I've tried the smallest possible subtitles on netflix/amazon prime, grey subtitles, yellow subtitles, semitransparency, nothing seems to help.",2018-12-05 02:44:44

193,"You should talk to another representative. I had a similar issue as yours when I tried to place my order not once, twice, but 3 times. The first time I hopped on that Black Fri/Cyber Mon deal. Chose to buy an unlocked Note 9 for $200 off and chose the Samsung financing option to pay for the phone. Little did I know the billing information has to match the shipping information or else they'll cancel your order. 

So my order status gets changed to cancel so I call customer support to call to find out what went wrong. They told me I had to call the financing company to change the billing address so that's what I did. Called TD Ameritrade on Sat &amp; used their automated prompt to change my billing address. 

Wait another 3 days until Tues thinking my order will finally process and get changed to shipped. Nope, Samsung cancels my order again because they say the address they have on file is still my old address and not the new one that TD Ameritrade has. 

They tell me to wait 7 business days (12/04) to see if anything updates on their end as the computer automatically generated the order so it might correct itself. I even check TD Ameritrade login with my online account &amp; it shows my NEW updated billing address. 

So I call Samsung again and ask if they will honor my 20% discount since it shows in their system I had 2 cancelled orders. The representative tells me I am able to add the unlocked Note 9 to my cart and once the order goes through they can credit me back the $200 in the form of a refund. Well little did I know that I am going to go through the same frustrating process again. 

Place my order for a 3rd time and their system STILL shows that my billing address and shipping address don't match. I am at my wit's end in trying to order a phone from them because they should be able to manually update their database for any changes in billing address since TD Ameritrade reflects the new address change. 

Called customer support explaining to them that I think my order is going to get cancelled again for a THIRD time because of their incompetence to comprehend what information I am trying to relay to them. If my order gets cancelled again I swear I am going to bombard all their social media accounts in regards to how poor their customer service is and that Apple would not lead me as the consumer into an endless cycle of processing to cancelled orders.

194,"Note 9 is very good, has everything you will ever need. It is just the camera is the downfall, but coming from an iPhone you won't notice much of a difference, note 9 and the new iPhone camera are kinda on the same level on average, it is only pixel and the Huawei is a level above every one else.

If camera isn't too big of a concern I suggest note 9. Presumably you will be better support because I don't know the situation of Huawei in your country but I would think Samsung is more accessible",2018-12-05 03:41:47

196,"Ebay is showing results for the screen around £180 - £220.

If your screen is broken then it's really really easy to fix. Heat the edges of the phone with a hair drier and use a guitar pick to run around the edges removing the glue from the phone. As you get all the way around the screen you lift it off slowly and disconnect the little tabs. Looks to be around 3 of them. One at the top, side and bottom. (Push in or pop off type connecters)

Put new screen in place, attach connectors and seal up with the pre applied sticky tape around the edges of the new screen.

Fixing the frame is another story. You will always have those dents but you will have a working screen.

If you have insurance then claim via that. Typically £60 excess if not repair it yourself. Just take your time as removing the screen for the first time might take you 10 minutes or more as you're super gentle. But you will get a feel for it.

I can keep going and it doesn't have to end with just planes. there are lots of gory photos too. 

but Google it. you won't find this issue when audio jacks and power jacks weren't merged because audio jacks weren't capable of delivering this kind of voltage. you will find people getting static shocks etc from ipods incidentally 

people have been safely using audio jacks for about a hundred years in one form or another and there was no reason to eliminate them. apple started the trend because they are crazy patent licensing hawks 

the implication isn't that is was specifically Apple but that merging the audio jack and the power jack is a terrible idea as people already knew

I can charge another phone with my phone. the power jack is capable of driving way more power than is necessary to deliver audio but just enough to get your head to explode

if audio jacks were as much of a risk before you'd imagine 100+ watt power amps with audio jacks would be making lots of head lines. shoot TVs used to have audio jacks. TVs are such high voltage pieces of machinery that you can pick one up from the junkyard and punch your hand through one and die from the residual capacitance ",2018-12-08 19:15:22

316,"If AC 110/220V passed through your phone's internals it would fry anything and everything attached to it. Dongle or not. Most headphones jacks are placed on the same PCB as the charging port even on Samsung devices. 

The Audio adapter has a DAC, it draws a little bit of current from the battery and that's it. You aren't connecting your headphones to the power source directly. There is a very small chance for the dongle's circuitry to overheat and get fried, and even then, the 5V will not cause any damage to your ears let alone kill you. Apple just moved the entire circuitry outside the phone to make it a hassle and force people to buy their wireless accessories. So long as the damage is in the dongle and not the wall adapter. You are safe. 

TL;DR regardless of what phone you have, it is never a good idea to use it while charging because it could overheat ,short circuit and then ignite. Wearing earphones when this happens will be even more catastrophic.

Look at the bottom board, the USB C port and the Headphone jack are on the same board. And that board is connected to the main IC with a small ribbon connector where the pins are 0.5 millimeters apart.

I'm not shitting on Samsung phones, I still think they're the best phones available. But this is normal in most phones in order to reduce the overall size. Take a screwdriver to the charging port of an S9 or an iPhone X, nothing will happen. Because they are designed to survive short circuits.
Apple just moved part of that bottom board out of the phone. To ""save space""


The USB DAC (Dongle) isn't really software controlled, it uses the data lines for the audio signal and draws a couple of milliamps from the charging line. Can the DAC get overheated by drawing too much current? Yes. Is it likely? No. There is circuitry intended to limit current and the DAC itself will just get damaged and not work before it could harm you. People buying cheap dongles will, in the worst case scenario , have the entire 5V 2A pass to their headphones which will just damage the internal drivers and they would have to be replaced.

The only way it would be lethal is if you have a faulty adapter that wrongly sends the entire AC Voltage to your phone, at this point it does not matter if you have the headphone jack on a dongle, at the bottom of the phone or the top of the phone. Everything including your hands is going to get fried(if there is current flow).",2018-12-09 14:44:52

339,"Purchasing a Samsung phone off of eBay likely means it is an international model. There are several variants of the Note 9 specific to various regions and they all have different capabilities for accessing cellular networks (specifically, the bands and frequencies).

I am in Canada and purchased a dual-sim Note 9 from eBay, but since it is from a different region (Asia), it does not support all of the bands from my two carriers. Therefore I find that I only receive one or two bars, just like you, and slower download speeds. This isn't too big of a problem for me since I'm mostly on wifi doing internet-connected tasks rather than calls and SMS and I'm willing to put up with it because I need the dual-sim functionality, but this may cause significant issues if you rely on these basic features.

TL;DR international models of Samsung phones that were purchased online are not fully compatible with North American telco networks due to bands and frequencies.

377,"&gt;The headphone jack is still part of the circuitry, it's just not soldered on. This is to help with repairs. Still in case of a short circuit, it will pass the current through the headphone jack.
&gt;
&gt;I understand what you mean by  buffer, it is like having  a mini fuse built in. But my point is that the Dongle is literally moving the internal circuitry (DAC and Port) outside , the S9 also has a DAC built in the phone. 
&gt;The dongle to charging port interface is the same as the S9's daughter board to main board. 
&gt;
&gt;Is there any advantage to this? Sort of. There is a possibility of having a higher quality DAC and driving more demanding headphones (higher impedance). and audio will sound very similar across every device because the DAC is the same.  But you could do this on the S9 as well whilst keeping the headphone jack.
&gt;
&gt;The disadvantages are far more though, more wear on the port, more failure points (not lethal), can't listen to music without a dongle. Etc etc.
&gt;

sure granted some freak accident lightning strikes your house etc then it won't matter but having a thin gauge only enough to pass 3v between your phone and your audio jack is a good idea as is having an audio jack. if headphone cables were comprised of the same amount of metal I would bet there'd no how way for a lethal dose of electricity to pass through. 


and while you're right maybe offboard dacs could be better but doesn't that just pass the buck? if the industry got away with providing only the most baseline dac and then expected the consumer to pay to play Russian roulette with dongles they're still providing another unnecessary need for a point of failure.
 the s7 had don't have USB c. particularly the snapdragon one because was hated among audiophiles because it was both shouth and thin. the S8 however hadded a dedicated dac and sounds great in my opinion if not quite as loud as I'd want. 

we've reached similar to the late 90s with cd players that most are quite good with the only real limitation being volume which isn't really an issue for most people. 

all I see are dishonest reasons for why ""we"" benefit from the dropping of the headphone jack, the worst being that ""its out dated"" which is just a fox news style claim. 

""theres dongle for that"" slogan is anti consumer. the iPhone 7 added a spacer where the audio jack would have been that's ironically the same size and rough shape as an audio jack. it's literally plastic piece. 

the apple excuse never made sense. first they claimed it was to allow the device to be water resistant which was clearly ignoring innovation from other sources again. then it was about saving space which still doesn't seem to be probably given that there are devices smaller and thinner than the iPhone 7 that handle their audio jack fine. 

it's annoying how many times ever since Apple dropped theirs did the media claim that everyone else would copy them which is a cheap way to claim that Apple was being innovative and others needed to ""catch up"". for Apple it meant selling a lot more dongle. licenses and for the rest of us just meant a firewall between audio production and consumption.

all the reasons the people are told have been bullshit with the truth being something closer to ""they wanted save a few cents. they wanted to sell dongles with lightnkng port licensing etc. but the best way is still to allow people to have the option of the more reliable audio jack while still having the device capable of USB c audio as well as Bluetooth advancements . 

sure the dongle removed the charger from the phone so now the power is being handled by the dongle which also should in its best base scenario prevent the power from unloading through the audio port but I bet you these singles are likely hardwired to be cheap and compact rather than modular as the s9 is. 

the thing that would be at risk of burning our isn't even the phone anymore but the dongle which would explain why only one of the dbejfes one seen features a charred phone and that have been one ages ago. 

&gt;
&gt;Regardless of what phone you use, I guarantee you will suffer the same consequences if the charger decides to pass the AC Voltage through the cable.
&gt;

maybe it's shock my hand but I really doubt that tiny ribbon band would be capable of carrying enough current to cause someone's head to explode. if you grab some speaker voice cable and lie 4 side by side in ribbon formation you'll quickly burn the wires out if you try to send more than 9v over them. In tech you fan use they as an easy way to cut and toast bread at the same time.. 


if the ribbon cable managed to merge with the board and the board itself became conductive then yea you'd die. but all these little safe guards are useful. I don't see any reason why anyone would choose to follow Apples example at all. apple gains by licensing and drm protection with no more loop hole ports. 

android companies just seem to be doing it to copy Apple pressured by the audio industry to further lock down drm via an all digital audio output route. the drm thing doesn't make as much sense since you can easily download any file onto an android anyway. 

I have a Google pixel 2 dongle and it's dac is pretty bad so now it's just collecting dust. 

&gt;Now, if there is a short circuit in your cable itself and you are using an original charger, you will be safe because they are designed to handle worn cables that will inevitably have a short. This is what will happen with the lightning adapter in the worst case scenario. 

on a wing or a prayer. the audio jack is separated from the board by a very thin ribbon cable with small. copper connections. the lightning port is still a combination port capable of sending or receiving power just like the USB c port which on galaxies are also an option. 

you don't see too many people buying enhanced powered USB or lightning port headphones though so I'm starting to think that was never really an idea. 

&gt;
&gt;You will find many incidents of people in third world countries buying cheap Chinese adapters(Wall plug) and then getting their ears burnt along with their earphones after the adapter short circuits. And none of these were due to a faulty dongle, in fact most were even before 2016.

you can find isolated incidence about once every 2 or 3 years going back to it looks like 2014 but there has been a shocking rise in reports in 2018 alone and more on begween 2016 and 2018.

the flack Samsung gets for not following the ""new way"" is unethical and its a good thing that the audio jack which is the most versatile port there is being just a low-voltage unamplified version of the same copper connection that loud speakers a d musicians use. the audio jack is the last industrial grade jack and I hope the trend of trying to fall it obsolete dies before it causes more problems. 

while your headphones are plugged into your charging port don't you think it's a little scary that a piece of a malicious software could just switch the output to max? save guards be damned. where there's a will there's a way. 

a nice handy 3v output audio jack is great and I hope people are fooled into having it be dropped in favor of dongles. 

and granted I'm am biased. if the mediu continue to say this things like ""while Samsung still insists on featuring the audio jack"" ąs if well all be excited when we lose it. ",2018-12-11 06:55:56

Given that I purchased mine with a student discount I feel that the price to performance ratio is equivalent to the iPad Pro but with the benefit of running my preferred operating system. As for using the S4 alongside a Note 9, I don't see any lack of optimization nor any lapse in performance despite the ram and cpu differences. The only thing the Tab S4 is objectively worse at is taking pictures, and I'm not exactly losing sleep over it.

In this case, your phone has a snapdragon where in Asian countries the Exynos variant is used. The official Samsung repair center in Japan would not be able to repair your phone because when they open the device and if somehow they mess one of the circuits in the PBA (basically your motherboard of your phone) and if they can't replace the part like for like, it won't pass quality check. My advice would be to take it to a 3rd party repairer if its just the screen. Granted, they might not use original Samsung parts but it will do as a temporary fix. Having said that, 3rd party repairers can get really expensive because of the curved screen. Hope this helps. ",2018-12-12 04:07:19

Also, yes displays are identical. Again, try to understand, what I'm trying to say is if they f*ck up your repair they can't replace your phone like for like just because they don't sell Snapdragon variants in Japan, and part of the quality check process is to make sure that the device repaired is like brand new otherwise that gives customers the chance to sue Samsung.

As such, each regional Samsung only stocks parts and can only service devices from it's own territory. 

Additionally, the S7 Edge has the charging board integrated into the screen assembly. This charging board has other hardware in it, including antenna connections. A board from Japan will only work with Japanese S7 Edge.

Finally on some models, there are slight differences in the main board and/or screen connector between carrier / regions. This means that a Japanese screen connector may not even align or connect to your main board.

Cmon dude. It's just a fridge. Samsung is Korean. It's easy to see how they'd forget about black people. Nothing a simple skin tone picker wouldn't fix. No need to pull the ""I can't relate to this"" card",2018-12-13 08:17:15
441,"Yeah I wish I could have S10+ 500GB without curved screen. I love Samsung phones, just not that. Lite probably going to have shit specs bro. I sure the hell not paying almost $1400 or $1700 smh. Will wait for drastic price drops.

443,"I love Samsung, I'm a huge fan, a Samsung loyalist, I recently upgraded from the S7 to the Note9. I prefer the small bezels than to the bezel less display. I want my Note9 to last a while, hell, I might buy another one once this ones charge cycles are done, but this is as bad as Apple. I understand that you do listen to what the customers want, but at a high cost. I have the Note9, Tab S4, S9+, and the Galaxy Watch. I love Samsung just the way it is. Why not make other things? A gaming console, more laptops, legit laptops, not 2-in-1. Gaming accessories, collab with other people and companies, have a Rick and Morty themed Note9 or something. I wish I could just throw my phone out the window and not need one ever again, so I can just read, but I'm addicted. I see innovation, but it is headed in the wrong direction. There's a lot of other stuff you can make that possibly even more people would buy than just phones.",2018-12-13 09:27:26

Typically most phones use ADB Shell and ADB Commands. Root lets you install apps as  System apps, meaning that they cannot be un-installed. For purposes that the App always runs in the background.

I can't imagine it's an app draining that much. I don't play games on mobile, snapchat gets used but only a few times a day, reddit is fun, Pandora, and chrome are my most used apps.

I've had it longer than I thought, bought it back in March so I guess I'm SOL with boost or Samsung making things right.... Ugh.

You can use translate (hover with the pen) and get a translation as you go. Bixby vision can tell me what a product is and where to get it. We have these bins at work I like but had no idea what they were called and couldn't find them. Bixby figured out what they were and I bought some. :)

S-Health has a lot of features. It has a built in sensor to determine your heartrate and your oxygen levels. It's similar to the ones hospitals put on your fingers. They've had that feature since the S5.


Oh and Samsung Pay! It uses MST (and NFC) so I can pay almost everywhere. I can pay at places that don't even have the new machines compatible with wireless pay. You get points and rewards too for using it.

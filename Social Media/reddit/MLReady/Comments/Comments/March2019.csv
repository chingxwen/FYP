1,"I think Google and Microsoft should do that, not Samsung. And Samsung (and other manufacturers) should stop trying to create their own ecosystem and let Google do it. Let everything work with Google Drive (instead of Samsung Cloud), for example, just like iCloud. And implement Google Duo on every Android phone, like FaceTime. And implement Google Messages on every phone like iMessage. I could go on and on about this but I think you get what I'm trying to say. This would make it much easier to switch from iOS to Android.

2,He mentions scrolling. Is it really that different on a Samsung compared to an iPhone?,2019-02-28 08:19:12
3,"A - Correct. That is why they offer them on the website.  


B - It depends.. The phone would need to be carrier unlocked. Since you're buying it from Samsung, I'm not sure if they sell them unlocked, or if you would request an unlock code from them, or if you would need to get one from your carrier, or if new phones even come carrier locked anymore..   


Also, with the S9 or S9+, you could flash different carrier roms to the phone using Samsung's Odin software, since the hardware for an S9 on sprint was the same as an S9 on At&amp;t. So I could take my Verizon branded phone, flash At&amp;t's firmware to it, and it wouldn't be any different than if I had purchased an At&amp;t phone, other than having Verizon's name physically printed on the device.  


However, not all phones have identical hardware and the modem chip in those phones can only work with certain frequency bands. Meaning that a phone that may work on GSM wouldn't work on CDMA, or vice-versa.   


I believe all Qualcomm chips are physically capable of working on all bands, since it's only the firmware that governs the functionality, but I don't know if all the same rules apply to the S10. I read that somsung added some security that blocks Odin now. Only time will tell if the community gets around it, and if the system images are interchangeable still. As well as which devices, if any, are carrier locked and who unlocks them. Most carriers require you use the device on their network for a period of time before they allow you to unlock it. But again, I have no idea how it all works when purchasing through samsung, or with the S10",2019-02-28 08:25:43

9,"if Android ever gets to the point where everything is the same, we're basically a shittier version of apple to be honest.

As far as I'm aware, duo is the only video service so that's good.

Samsung wants to have that ecosystem experience just like Apple's, so that people stick to Samsung because of all the great features they can't live without. If they let Google handle all of that, then their customers are just going to keep looking for the best Android phone.

I used them again this week on my Note 8. I dropped and broke my screen they sent me a refurbished phone. Looks brand new though. Very easy but cost $249. Samsung care would have been $99. I also have a CC with phone insurance so I claimed that $249 with them so hopefully I will only be out $25.

I just ordered the Samsung S10 plus, since they are the same insurance I will just go with Samsung for the lower deductible plus lower monthly amount. Plus I bought the unlocked version, Tmobile Assurant would send me a tmobile locked phone and would need them to unlock it.",2019-02-28 10:40:22

37,"\&gt;I heard that Samsung phones generally slow down 

Um, that hasn't been a thing in years. 

On top of that, you have to consider this.  Do you want a whole terabyte of storage on your phone? Or nah. 

Do you want a bigass battery on your phone? Or nah. 

Do you want the ability to basically hack your phone's UI to do anything you want? 

Do you want access to all those third party apps that basically let you do whatever you want on your phone? 

Don't you want to use two apps at the same time?

72,"I switched from an iPhone to Galaxy S8 when the S8 came out. I love the customization options. You don't like the stock launcher download a new one and customize the shit out of it. Currently I blacked out my background and have all my app icons as white line art. I recently heard the saying, ""IOS treats you as a user, but Android treats you as the admin."" It couldn't be more true. 

All the customization is fairly simple to learn with a few youtube videos, the exception in a way is Tasker. Tasker is basically phone automation. For example, I set mine us so if my phone is vertical (In my car vent holder), plugged in to charge(Always plug my phone in in my car), has an audio cable connected(AUX cable in my car), and the phones GPS detects speeds greater than XYmph then I launch a weblink that opens spotify on my phone and plays Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins. I couldn't even dream of this amount of customization on IOS, you can't even put your apps where you want. 

I was huge into IOS around IOS 8-9, watching every rumor and every video. But I switched and after about a week of difficulty it became smoother than IOS ever was. You may be deep into the ecosystem, but you can run a lot of stuff on android, even apple music. I won't lie if you use the iCloud and some other Apple functionalities daily you may miss them.

74,Upgrading from an S6. I have a bunch of Samsung brand chargers but they have micro usb cables instead of usb-c. Would it hurt my battery to use a micro usb to usb-c adapter or regular usb-c cables with my old chargers rather than buy new chargers? ,2019-02-28 17:14:33
75,I'd like a little clarification on this. I currently have an unlocked s9 bought directly from Samsung that I have on Verizon network. However I do have wifi calling as it came with an update several months ago. Am I understanding that out of the gate the s10 will not have wifi calling as an unlocked device?,2019-02-28 17:19:50

I'm convinced that their Galaxy apps are purposely draining the battery so you get the S10. Happens like clockwork every two years your Samsung phone will start acting up wether it be lag or battery drain.

160,"To answer your question, it would be worth it. The Exynos processor is only slightly less powerful than the Snapdragon 855. However, Samsung has really stepped it up with One UI. The integration will most likely be better with Exynos seeing as it's their chipset. 


I also have the Pixel 2XL and I was in the same boat. However, there are two things that made me pull the trigger.


 For one Samsung's hardware is top of the line. And even after holding the S10e in my hand I looked at my Pixel 2XL in a different way, it feels cheapish (could just be me). 


The other thing is that you can tell Samsung is actually trying again. This lineup is not some little upgrade from last year, it's huge. It's actually innovative and that makes me excited about Samsung again. 


As for the camera, I have been seeing shots on Instagram that people are taking and they look pretty damn good. That Ultra Wide Angle Camera though. ",2019-03-01 05:13:19

Oke then I am going to get that Iphone they are offering right now"" Samsung literally would lose billions if they would do it. I think that Deutsche Telekom is the parent company of T-Mobile.

Get used to the ""back"" function (button/key/digital key/whatever it is). IMO is the greatest advantage for android against iphone

Bixby: Not that useful right now, but it could be interesting to use it for phone functions (volume, presets, call). Or you can just remap the button. I've read that S10 comes with it remappable by default, but out there is an app to do so, BxAction i think it is

As far as the camera, you can download apps to ""tweak"" the camera to your liking and see if that makes a difference. When I get my S10+, I'm going to insta the Google camera and use it instead of Samsung's software. I currently use it on my Razer Phone 2 and I haven't taken any pics with my iPhone X in a few months.

290,"1) Samsung Flow unfortunately has terrible connection with both Bluetooth and WiFi.
2) You cannot use WhatsApp for most features that Pushbullet offers (file transfer/ remote access of device from phone/ universal copy and paste between all devices/ a bunch of other features)
3) Pushbullet works in most browsers as well as an add-on and does not need to be downloaded to your computer.

Frankly it depends on what you use it for, but if all you do is want messaging from your computer you can switch from SMS to WhatsApp if that's what you would like to do. If you want to retain communicating via SMS then Pushbullet or Samsung Flow may be the best option. Again, in my opinion Flow is horrendous at a seamless transition from phone to PC as you need Bluetooth on for it to work.

To clarify: I do not have a Pushbullet pro subscription. I use their free features. ",2019-03-01 18:30:43

If this notch-like design stuff is long in our tech future, I’m ok with what Samsung has done with this S-series devices.

Since they are supposed to be empirically measured they can differ across manufacturers, but I've seen them be pretty consistent within the brand.

&amp;#x200B;

The S10+ uses 25-28% more power at max-min brightness compared to the S10e, but the battery is 36% bigger.  Idle power draw is the same.

336,"there are a number of manufacturers who make usb-c to usb-c certified cables.

You don't say which country you are in, which matters when it comes to seller suggestions, and mains socket pin format/voltage.

I personally favour Anker who make excellent quality 3rd party accessories. They do the cable below, which would probably be the one I'd go for at £10. 

There are cheaper alternatives, even an AmazonBasics one for £6.99 but if it were me, I would spend the extra for the better quality.

You've plenty of choice on Amazon when it comes to AC wall chargers, from those which provide both usb-A and usb-c, to others which provide multiple  output charging sockets (most of which are usually usb-A).

I would personally use a phone manufacturer supplied power brick, e.g. Samsung original, with a type A to type C cable, but I see that this Klearlook one has both, gets good reviews and is reasonably cheap (but they're an unknown brand to me)

Not only that: you can also use external microphones or headphones with your jack while you can charge your phone!

And its true. The comapnies remove the jack to sell their 5000$ wireless buds. But unfortunately Samsung will remove the jack too although the jack will not save any space in the phone. Why? Because the 3.5mm is as big as the USB C connector.",2019-03-02 06:08:27

Sure newer one now I need to bust out my big wireless charging keep my phone on that and then use my headset. 

I use noise cancelling headphones and people are like you should get wireless ones. No the mic gets to much feedback so I use a wired one for quality. 

This is such a big thing for me. I need to be able to plug my phone in charge it and use my headphones while my device is in my pocket. A true wireless solution just doesn't fit my professional needs. 

You can get adapters and dongles... i just want to plug my headphones in work and if my phone is dying charge it at the same time. Simple, easy and out of the box with several extra cords and devices. 

Samsung it just does it, no mess no fuss. 

Please keep the headphone Jack.

But that doesn't mean that Android apps are trash, you just have to accept that they won't be as polished as those on iOS..  


Other than that, Samsung has gone A LONG way in creating hardware and software for their phones.. I for one really like their new ONE UI much better than iOS 12 on my iPhone..

I use to rush out and buy the newest note every year but I'm starting to feel like the note line doesn't introduce anything new anymore, rather it lags behind the Galaxy line and just sports a bigger screen and a pen. I used to tell everyone I have the best phone in the world, but now it seems that it's just a newer version of a Galaxy line. I really wish Samsung would step it up a notch and bring high eed features and next generation tech to the note line instead of following in the Galaxy's footsteps.",2019-03-02 18:06:53

It's especially hard where the likes of Essential, Oneplus, Nokia, Oppo, Vivo, Xaomi, Sony, ... all give day one updates, or even have concurrent betas with Google themselves. You basically buy knowing you are rolling the dice on if you will ever get a major revision update, and where minor revision too is an unknown. 

If you're not okay with the device exactly as it exists today, you should consider another vendor. If you're okay with it as is, congrats as it will probably be what you'll have forever.

479,"Although Samsung are pretty bad at timely updates, this is a complete overexaggeration. 

I've had a mid range Samsung for almost 2 years now and I've got security updates every 3 months at least. So yeah, it took a little longer to get the ""BIG"" shiny new Nougat/Oreo when it came around, but it was worth the wait in the end and the changes were actually extremely miniscule.

I'm now stuck with Oreo, I won't get Pie, and you know what, I'm happy with it... I honestly don't think I like the look of Pie and I'm not sure I want the changes... I've already had 2 big updates (Nougat/Oreo) and I'm continuing to get security support as promised, and I didn't even buy a flagship. 

People should be aware that Samsung are NOT the quickest to update, yes, but people should also be aware that they already have most of their software down now, and changes are generally small between each iteration anyway, so not having the latest isn't as big an issue as it would be on iOS.

Even then, having the new software first is never a good idea, everyone knows it takes a few months to properly iron out the main problems.",2019-03-02 19:05:12

483,"I second this. Samsung makes better phones than Apple imho. But the apps on iOS just render better. Especially all the new releases. Its a known fact that developers prefer iOS as a platform because iOS users are more likely to pay for stuff rather than Android. So most of the new apps or games are custom built for iOS and ported for Android later. 
That said, the typical top 100 odd apps that most people use work great. No difference there. 
Overall I still use Samsung for my phone. But by GOD do I miss my iPad. Nothing on Android compares to that. So if you are a tablet user. Maybe keep that in mind ",2019-03-02 19:38:28

488,"My last internet research showed that the flagship phones from both Apple and Samsung cost $1000 out of pocket.

489,"Yep - Got an email this afternoon that my S10+ order had been cancelled.  Tried to pre-order again, but the AT&amp;T side actually appeared to have somewhat processed my S10+ order and therefore said that I need to pay off the remaining balance of the phone in order to be eligible for an upgrade.  Talked to the AT&amp;T customer service and they kept assuring me that everything on their end showed my order as pending.  I explained that everything on the Samsung side said cancelled.  I asked who the phone came from, and they said direct from Samsung, so then I said if it's cancelled on the Samsung side, seems like I wouldn't be getting a phone and potentially missing out on a $550 trade in and $130 eCertificate now.  AT&amp;T trade is is $200 and you get a $100 Visa Gift Card.  


After 3 people and a supervisor, my line now shows as eligible for upgrade on the AT&amp;T site, but if I try to pre-order through Samsung it still shows up saying that I need to pay off the S10+ before I can upgrade...ugh...Hopefully by tomorrow morning the AT&amp;T and Samsung systems will sync and I can redo my pre-order.  I pre-ordered during the unveiling and now I'm a bit annoyed that I wont get the buds with my order and that I have to wait an additional week or two for the phone assuming this all gets sorted out.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first time pre-ordering a Samsung phone and I'm not overly impressed thus far.  Would have bee nice to get some sort of 'we're having troubles processing your order, please call support at XXX-XXX-XXXX to avoid further delays or cancellation'...versus a flat out cancellation, call your carrier email.",2019-03-02 20:51:24

492,"Hey all, this happened to me also, I'm super pissed. I pre-ordered on Feb 23rd to wake up this morning (on the eve of the phone release practically) to find out the order was cancelled. I also noticed that the galaxy buds that were supposed to come with our order are sold out, which isn't a huge deal, but it the principle that we deserve what we ordered for first as opposed to $130 Credit. I was intent on financing via my carrier through Samsung as the better promo and trade-in deal was only offered there, I called Samsung twice as well as Verizon, and finally spoke to a samsung rep that informed me that this is a widespread issue that was a mistake at the hands of Samsung and they are going to reach back out to me when the problem has been rectified. 

I say all that to say this:

Don't settle for these lame azz deals through your carrier or reorder the phone, Samsung is aware of this issue by now and they basically have been making notes of every account and sending it to tech as these cancellations were made without purpose and is some widespread error, and Samsung is assuring me that I will get my order this Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

When I purchased, I read all of the Terms and Conditions, it never said Samsung had to right to cancel orders without specific purpose. I'm gonna re read the terms and conditions and if they cancelled our orders outside the terms of their policies, I would suggest we all file a class action lawsuit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not that upset over the buds, or the phone thing, I'm more upset at the principle of the matter and these big companies not having good customer service as they're so big that they cannot be held accountable due to the sheer number of orders. I'm sick of that.

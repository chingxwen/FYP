This means using a bluetooth headset or earbuds wont impact your battery as much. Furthermore if Samaung really wanted to step up their game they could include a pair of bluetooth AKG tuned LevelOn earbuds with their phones. Replacing their current option on wired earbuds.",2019-07-02 09:48:53

110,"New issue that arose with my Samsung Note 9. After a few minutes of connecting to a wireless connection and doing any minor data consumption, the wifi icon will have an exclamation mark over it and going over in the Wifi Settings, it will say that ""Internet May Not Be Available"". 

Few things to note:
- Bought last October 2018.
- Was able to connect to WiFi normally before.
- Issue will not appear or happen on other devices connected in the wifi but they will be disconnect once my phone shows the exclamation point.
- Issue has happened on multiple Wifi connections already.
- Exclamation point started to appear last April.

Troubleshooting Steps done:

- Reset Wifi Settings
- Reset Phone (Hard and Soft Reset)
- Brought phone to Samsung Service center, reset it using their own tools.
- Main board already replaced by them.

At this point, I can no longer use the phone since the connection won't stay connected for me to update the apps and software fully.

A bonus to that is that the language is set to UK English, so it's pretty easy to go through and change all the settings from UK -&gt; US to make the date, time, etc. all work as expected. The Warranty is definitely NOT active as there is a sticker on the outside advising the Malaysian retailer to activate the Warranty at time of sale to the specific customer, which eGlobal most definitely does NOT do. I looked into it further and there is a special backend system the retailers use to perform this warranty activation...so again, no warranty for this.

The only even slightly negative issues are:

* Battery Life isn't the best - seems Exynos processors may be more power hungry. Also it won't charge with lower power chargers, so some of my older stands/chargers don't charge it...but the QC3 and Adaptive Fast Samsung ones do fine.
* Case variety is a bit wanting, since it's not a mainstream US model...and I've not found a good one with auto wake/sleep magnet when open/close. Infiniland makes a couple OK ones.

Also Samsung has added additional services which basically give you occasional ad or wallpapers with product placements (you turn this off in the initial setup process), and as you set the phone up, you are presented with a screen of recommended third party apps which is essentially an ad for these apps.

286,"**Should I get the Tab S4 now, or wait for the Tab S5 to release?**

---

So I'm looking to get a tablet. A lot of people have said an iPad is the best buy at the moment, but in my case I don't think that's true. Firstly, the non-pro models have thick bezels, no USB-C ports, and too little storage. The pros are better, but no headphone jack, and no internal SD card slot, means I'd be forced to buy the 512GB or 1TB version, since I require a lot of space. Those are as expensive as high end laptops, at which point I'd prefer a laptop.

Meanwhile the Tab S4 on the other hand, is actually under my original intended budget, looks the perfect size, has nice small bezels like the iPad Pros, comes with the pen, comes with proper bluetooth keyboard/mouse support, has a headphone jack, has microSD support.. Couple that with the fact I've owned a Samsung phone before and it had the nicest screen out of any phone I've bought before. Plus, I'm already an Android user, so it means I don't have to figure out alternatives for all the apps I've been using.

So it seems like a no-brainer, but just now while reading about Linux on Dex, I noticed mention of a Tab S5 on the site, so I googled it, and some sites are suggesting the Tab S5 will be released next month, with the new Snapdragon 855 processor. This is tempting because while 95% of the stuff I want the tablet for probably isn't too resource intensive, I do like the idea of video editing on my tablet, and I think the extra performance would be seen there. 

What do you guys think - worth waiting?",2019-07-06 10:39:11

351,"Everyone was freaking out when Apple removed their 3.5 jack. Now it's been adopted in the following models and no headline since then says anything in the line of ""APPLE DIDN'T RE-INTRODUCE THE HEADPHONE JACK"" because everyone stopped caring. Yes there's people that will never want it to go like yourself but the future is wireless, portless phones. That's the way it is. Being salty about the removal is fine, but stop making the 100th post about the note removing it, we've known for months now that it was going to be a thing. We get it, it sucks, the world is ending, blah blah blah. It was going to happen sooner or later. Just rip off the bandaid and move on. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for the punchhole camera. What's different than the s10? Yeah it's in the middle, so what? People apparently still want a selfie camera and the tech to fit it under the display isn't mature enough to be made mainstream for atleast another 2 gens. 

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding the removal of retina scanning, if you've ever used it you know that it takes long and it sucks. Once samsung finds their version of Face ID everything will be good, but until then just use the fingerprint scanner or face unlock. Yes it's not as secure but bull f\*cking shit if you tell me that you used the retinal scanning each and every day because it's shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding the wireless buds, they never said they would include it in the phone? It might be a pre-order bonus but that's it. People are switching to wireless every day, look around, airpods are everywhere nowadays because it's conveniant. If you really want the audio experience from a pair of wired headphones just use a DAC or w/e their called to actually get some nice sound from your phone. Or you better get used to that dongle life because it's coming.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To end this long ass rant. Just find alternatives to the 3.5 jack. Yes it's difficult and something that shouldn't be happening but it is. So stop PMSIng about it.

Here is a video example. As you can see, the brightness changes by itself when covering the light sensor, even though auto brightness is set to off. It might be hard to see the difference in the video but it's quite noticeable in real life.  


Is there a way to fix this?",2019-07-08 12:38:18

I ordered my s10 on the 29th of last month and it won't get here until tomorrow, but the Samsung site said it was backordered until the 15th until the day it shipped.

422,"I have the regular XS and also an S10e (I prefer smaller devices). I swap them out ever week or so just for fun. I generally prefer my iPhone most of the time. Camera is much better on the XS IMO. Everything on the iPhone also feels a tad bit smoother than the S10.

I do love the customization on the S10e though and Samsung pay cannot be beat. I also prefer the hole punch over the notch and the fingerprint sensor is pretty handy so I don’t have to awkwardly stare at the phone to unlock it like with Face ID.

I think if you have other Apple products and you’re tied into iMessage and other Apple services then you should just stick with your XS Max, but if that stuff doesn’t matter to you then yeah the S10 Plus is an amazing phone.",2019-07-08 14:50:20

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up late as my phone was no longer turned on and I missed the alarm. I was greeted with a boot screen that refused to do anything. It was the 'Samsung Galaxy S7 Powered by Android' screen. Nothing happened. Attempting to Vol Down + Home + Power resulted in the same thing continuously.  It didn't even power off, it just jumped back to the boot screen.

&amp;#x200B;

After a number of attempts, I left it alone for a while (I went into work) and when I checked it again I had an image of a yellow warning sign paired with a dead android robot. This bodes very poorly. As well as personal content, I had a bunch of very important work stuff on my phone.

469,"I think the user tries to say, the performance expectation depends on the owner of the phone. I never play games on the phone, my usage mainly leans on videos, internet surf and social media. With that perspective buying a flagship phone just for this light resource usage is waste of money for me.

In my opinion phone screens beyond 1080p resolution just marketing gimmicks. No matter how high quality they are, the viewing experience not even a notch of 4k monitors or 4k tv's. More battery consumption is a downside comes with that.

A50 is able to record 4k 30fps with Opencamera app. Samsung's camera software not even in par with the camera hardware on the phone. The main 1080p 30fps setting comes with the phone records with 17 megapixels, not even using the full potential of 25mp camera. With the next update samsung gives ultra slow motion and night mod on their camera app. Indian market already got the update.

I thing you got the ram and storage data wrong. A50 has 6gb ram and 128gb storage+ microsd option. The budget flagship s10e has the same ram and storage figures. You get more juice with the next steps of S family (duh!).

Final words, if you don't use camera much (I took about 30 photos per year) and you don't play games on your phone the A50 worth the money but if photography is important to you, stay away from this phone. If you are a mobile gamer be aware, this phone doesn't perform awesome on ultra settings on most games but anything beside those, you'll pretty much get the same things you get on S series.",2019-07-09 11:09:39

485,"it blinks blue when wireless powershare is enabled but nothing is charging. if there is something charging, its a constant red color. perhaps it can turn green when your galaxy buds are fully charged (like the wireless charging docks by samsung) but i havent tested that yet.",2019-07-09 15:32:10
486,"I have an iPhone XR for work and an S10+ for personal use and I'll take the S10+ any day. As far as glare, I can't tell the difference between the two. I didn't even know it WAS an issue, I've never noticed it. The iPhone is nice, but the display on the Galaxy is much better.

I have a Note 9 (out to be fixed, waterproofing failed) and bought this fella expecting nothing more than a mediocre phone. The Note's super-slowmo is way, way better. And real.

Anticipating a lot of buyers getting buyer's remorse ahead, and Samsung is fully accountable on that.",2019-07-09 17:59:12

# Samsung SecretZone file encryption - Sorry, don't know where to go for help on this one...

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a drive with Samsung SecretZone encryption for a while. It came with a Seagate drive I purchased.

Since I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 I don't have access to all my important encrypted files.

I can't seem to find any information at all anywhere for this software!!!

The setup program won't install in Windows 10.

I  found Samsung's ""SecretZone UpdateTool""  which apparently runs a   program to update the \*.msr file (the encrypted data) to a new format.   This runs and finds my 2 original IDs (admin and guest) to sign in but   whichever one I pick doesn't matter because this software does not find   the msr files which are definitely there.

Even if it found them and updated the file format, what would open it if the original app doesn't run in Windows 10???

Does anyone have any clue of how to fix this or where to go for help?

I can't believe I can't find any resources!!!

Thank you",2019-08-31 16:55:28

Either wait for the S11 or... And I hope I don't get chewed out for this, but wait for the Pixel 4. That's basically the iPhone of Android phones. Straight from Google. Superb hardware. More then likely going to be a better camera then anything out there cause their software is so stupid optimized for their phones(really wish they'd make the G camera available for download as an app), and it gets the latest OS updates first and foremost. The cleanest version of Android you can get without anything on top of it, like One UI. Not to say One UI isn't bad but if you want the absolute best Android experience, I really don't think you can go wrong with either or. I don't feel like you'll get a lot out of the s10+ coming from the R. And the pixel 4 is literally like... 2 months away at max. Usually comes out in October. And I'm personally waiting for my note 10+. If the pixel was going to have a stylus I'd wait on that myself but I know they won't. Not for a while. But that's my take.",2019-08-31 18:48:10

46,"Sure. 

There are two reasons why iPad OS basically dashed my hopes for my iPad Pro.

1: iOS made sense as a choice for the iPad Pro because it was a pre-packaged OS designed to work really well with touch interfaces. It was very limited, but it did it's limited things quite well. If Apple had intended to fragment the OS to develop more useful productivity features, it would have made far more sense to create a special blend of MacOS that already supported virtually all professional grade software from the beginning. Instead, Apple will almost certainly create an enormous mess of the operating system as it tries to reverse-integrate features that it never anticipated having to deal with because it wasn't build around a desktop environment, meanwhile asking all third party developers in the world to create special iOS and iPad OS versions of their software. It's a huge ask.

&amp;#x200B;

2: iPad OS itself failed to impress me. It's still far behind Android, particularly Samsung's flavors with DeX, where productivity is concerned. It's half-hearted mouse support leaves a lot to be desired, things that a Galaxy S8 phone could easily outperform. You gain the ability to pin widgets, another antiquated Android feature. The text editing features seem like a confusing mess, which goes a bit to the design problems inherent mentioned in point 1. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, iPad OS fragmented iOS unnecessarily, showing that iOS was probably never the right choice for the iPad Pro whilst simultaneously losing most of the benefits of being part of iOS as it begins to distinguish itself over the next 5 or so years. Simultaneously, the real productivity enhancements are not where they need to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't to say the S6 or DeX is the clear answer--I guess it's to say that the Surface Pro is the real answer (or really, a desktop workstation). Computer professionals, with the possible exception of digital artists, still want to work in desktop environments because, well, desktop environments are way faster to work in. They were always built for productivity--they're the environments that develop other environments. Furthermore, Apple is still very anti-competitive when it comes to Windows environment connectivity (i.e. the most important one for professionals), failing even to allow third parties to create Continuity-esque applications while deciding not to pursue them on their own. While Apple intentionally kills their own PC-iPad connectivity, Android rapidly expands it, with Your Phone, Airdroid, Samsung Flow and DeX-over-Windows (or MacOS) connections, decisions that save me a great deal of time at work. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, the iPad Pro is and will remain a very good device to own, but it will be good at what it was always intended to do, which is basically a luxury Netflix browser or e-mail reader. As iPad OS attempts to figure out how to incorporate more desktop features, it will increasingly become a mess, and it will become more estranged from people who are already familiar with iOS, killing its principle advantage.",2019-08-31 21:36:23
47,"My coworkers use iPhone and they can't even get their photos out to share. They end up sharing the photos via email from iphone, and that so called smartphone sent the image reduced quality at 108 KB. To me Apple devices are just dumb and unnatural to use.

48,"So what exactly were you expecting?  You bought an Android phone apparently wanting Apple ecosystem integration? Did you also buy a Chromebook or Galaxy Tab or a Surface to replace a MacBook?  That is the level of idiocy you are laying out.  Do you expect to be taken seriously, or do you understand that you are coming off like a glorified troll?  Do you also understand there are people waiting for that device you never intended to keep?    

BTW, take the smoothness and optimization crap back to an iPhone subreddit where people actually believe it.  I use both and that garbage hasn't been true since the S8.  As for its biggest Achilles heel being it runs Android. Did you somehow miss that Samsung doesn't make IOS devices?  You needed to buy an expensive phone to demonstrate the \[blanking\] obvious?   

Now with respect to not matching Apple's ecosystem, that phone can interact with most Apple devices, other than the proprietary ones such as your watch.  It can also work with any and every Windows device on the market, without the need for something like iTunes.  That establishes Android, like Windows, as being an OS that extends across platforms, without restriction.  In fact, the phone you are returning is capable of running virtually on those other platforms, not that an iPhone offers anything genuinely comparable on a Mac. 

Use whatever phone you want. No one really gives a damn either here or in the land of iPhones.  If, however, you want to be an ass about it, expect to be treated accordingly.",2019-08-31 22:00:33
49,"&gt; I've never been interested in them simply because I feel my Note9 has better specs. 

Now I can't fully answer your question as this is my first Samsung device, but this simply isn't true looking at the specs page. 

Note 10+ has better processor, more RAM, larger battery, larger and newer display, better S-Pen with added features, up to 1TB microSD support, better camera with the cool AR/DepthVision tech at a hardware level, etc. 

I've seen people complain about the ultrasonic scanner but coming from the 6T (didn't have issues with that one either), this thing is a miracle and using it with the display off is extremely helpful. You also mention not wanting to lose a headphone jack and dedicated fingerprint sensor while spending $300 more, yet you're thinking about a Pixel 4? 


As for the last thing you're forgetting, those people can trade in their Note 9 and get a Note 10+ for $499 directly from Samsung. That's more than you can get for a local sale without the local sale hassle, and you're upgrading to the latest Note device if you wish to do so.",2019-08-31 22:04:40

51,"After using Android for most of my life, I used iPhone 8 Plus for 1 year, and I really hated it.

- Can't download files from the internet such as mp3.

- Can't share files between app easily. For example, I can't share photos from my Google Photo to Reddit. I had to download to my iphone before I could post it. On Android, you can post almost anything from any app as long as it is applicable. 

- There is no file management. I feel like I am not the owner of my own contents. On Android,  your files are yours to move around, and access with ease. With iPhone, I had to use iTune. If I find a tune I like on the internet, I can't download directly to my phone and make it my ringtone. I would need to download on a PC, then plug in iPhone and sync the tune.

- Storage management on iPhone is basically useless. It shows my storage is eating up by some apps, but no way to clear it or view what is it.

- iCloud is 5 GB. It is technically useless unless you pay. 

- The included charger is 5W, basically unchanged since forever. I had to use my Samsung charger for faster charging. Unless you pay more to get a faster charger.

- Quick setting is not actually quick. You have to go to setting manually if you want to select anything. 

- No multitasking, no back button. Sometimes the apps frozen, there was no way to go back 1 step because no back button. You have to close the wholething.

- When someone calls you, that calling screen pops right at you with no respect to what you are doing.

They tell our customer there's nothing wrong with the phone even though they can't connect to the internet or get calls texts etc. Idk in my experience I've never had issues with my Samsung products after having them for years. The only iPhone I've had that's survived since day one was the 6 which for its time I'll admit was an awesome phone.

92,"Generally speaking I think that Beats are not the best quality headphones in the world. They sound alright. I own Galaxy Buds, Solo 3, Studio 3, PowerBeats Pro, and recently sold my AirPods 2 to a family member.

With that being said, I definitely recommend the Studio 3 headphones over the Solo 3s if you absolutely want Beats branded over the ear headphones. HOWEVER, there are far superior headphones that are better than Beats in all areas for similar pricing.

As much as I don't like Beats after spending money on their headphones, I have to say that the **PowerBeats Pro** are very good. They are super comfortable, sound very nice, and they have great battery life. If you want good in-ear headphones I can always recommend those (they're a bit over priced).

When it comes to Galaxy Buds, I like them but I don't love them. They are headphones that I keep laying next to my laptop to use them when I'm getting some work done at home. Overall, they're a solid option and when paired with a Samsung phone, they add some good functionality.

Since you are comparing in-ear to over the ear headphones I'll rate the headphones out of 5 stars. My rating takes into consideration: build, sound quality, battery life, connectivity, and comfort for prolonged listening time as well as versatility of headphone uses.

* **Studio 3** 3 stars
* **Solo 3** 2.5 stars
* **PowerBeats** 4.5 stars
* **Galaxy Buds** 3.5 stars
* **Air Pods** 3.5 stars",2019-09-01 19:19:15

With that said, you have to remember that Apple products are a unison of Hardware and Software working as one. 

I saw a video a few days ago comparing a brand new Galaxy Note 10+ to an iPhone XS Max, the problem is that's last year's iPhone, literally a year old, and the iPhone was still faster with 4gb of RAM and last year's A12 versus 12 GB of RAM and a new Snapdragon

The fact of the matter is the iPhone simply does more with less, it's optimized better that's why 4 year old iPhones still run good as new and aren't all janky.

Android's answer is always to throw crazy specs at the phone as an attempt to overcome the unoptimizations.

I've used both iOS and Android extensively, and I really want a foldable phone, but I'm also really tired of the disjointed eco system (or lack of an eco system) on Android and also even though One UI is _fine_, I don't love the look of it, and the gesture navigation feels less refined than, let's say OnePlus or Xiaomi's gesture navigation. Don't even know if the Fold has the gestures either, I've only ever seen reviewers use the old nav buttons which is even more boring to me. 

With the Fold I am also worried about how the screen will age, because I figured I might enter some sort of Samsung Upgrade program if I were to get it, but if the screen gets scratched up so easily I'm wondering how much they vill deduct in value from it when you return it.

With the Note 10+ I'm just not sure what I think, it's such a beautiful phone but I still wasn't impressed with it, and I had both the S9/S9+, Note 9 and S10 earlier, and I do like Samsung but I usually find myself wanting to upgrade really fast when I use Samsung phones even if they still are good and can last for quite a while.",2019-09-03 00:48:49

Also being a previous iPhone user (as recent as having an iPhoneX, but not using anymore), It seems to me that Android/Samsung isn't as good at putting apps to ""sleep"" in the background as iOS (/ducks... ;P ). So I've always made it a point to ""close all"" or run the Optimizer whenever I think of it.

235,"You will never believe this....... 

I basically found out that Best Buy has been LYING to EVERYONE and found out why nobody (who pre ordered) is getting their phones!!

After calling Best Buy and Samsung all day and getting order statuses of ""ready for pickup"" then ""shipping"" then ""preparing to ship"" back and forth over and over, and everyone at Samsung and Best Buy saying ""I don't know"" to every question I asked, I finally got the truth. 

I eventually got through to a woman at Best Buy headquarters somewhere in the East (I live on the West Coast) and she told me ""let's check the status..... your phones have been waiting at your local Best Buy for a week now.""     ?!?!?!?

She then explained that somebody at Best Buy corporate headquarters messed up and mixed up all of the serial numbers nation-wide on all the new pre ordered Note 10 / Note 10+ s with their respective customers and that is why nobody is getting their phones (or they already have gotten it late). FINALLY the truth comes out!!!

This lady deserves a huge raise for telling the TRUTH and actually giving me some kind of actual information for once

So every time I check the status now and hear from a Best Buy employee or someone else that the phones aren't in yet, I'll be sure to tell them what is actually happening because either they were lied to by their supervisors or they are lying themselves. 

Still have no idea on when this mess will be sorted out (she said probably by September 10), but I at least finally think I know what is going on now. Best Buy should definitely hook us up for their massive screw-up and all of the torture and waiting we've went through. I'm even being billed for phones I don't have for almost a month now, and risk losing the Samsung Credit (the reason the deal was actually doable for me). Not sure if I will ever do business with them again though...",2019-09-03 15:27:27
236,"Not only unnecessary but can also damage the phone.  It is only water resistant and nothing in a shower is even remotely comparable to test conditions. In fact, other than salt water, it is a laundry list of things not to do.

Even with a new phone, the warranty is null and void if that happens.  Show some common sense and keep it out of the shower.",2019-09-03 15:57:07

On Fedex’a end, they stated that they are waiting for the package from Samsung. It’s been a “shipping label created” status for the last 4 days”. I took off tomorrow, from work,  since that was the original delivery date, according to fedex. And come to find out, it never shipped. Only a label was created. On top of that Samsung customer really could care less. I don’t know how many times I’ve called. And they all state “Yeah it’s backordered, you have to wait till it comes” . I would have never pre ordered this phone back on Aug 13, if I knew of this big headache, that it would cause.",2019-09-03 17:19:19

It even beats the OnePlus 7 pro's ""30"" watt charger that has a smaller battery too, it's miles faster, just image the 45 watt charger which should shave at least another 10 minutes off. Don't know where you've gotten your info from.

And yeah my bad, it's just another output not a third speaker. The haptics are literally better, and from what I've seen reviewers have acknowledged it and are happy with it Samsung said it themselves, becoming closer to the iPhone's superior haptic system. By design I meant the screen, in which the hole punch is way better, and I think the device looks more aesthetically pleasing for sure, but harder to hold because it's larger and more rectangluar.

Ram is always nice, and the s10 plus will reload large games for me when I'm multitasking, but sure, and yeah the extra sensor that allows for live focus which is pretty sweat, the glitch effect is awesome.",2019-09-04 11:25:37

317,"(copied from a previous post I made a few days ago, because I'm lazy)

The first thing I noticed was the size of the tablet itsself, it's a lot smaller than I was expecting. The next thing was how much screen Samsung have managed to fit into such a small form factor.

I've not had much time to really use it today, but as far as speed/performance go, it'll be right up there with the S/Note 10. I opted for the 256GB model with 8GB of storage, purely because it wasn't that much extra money in the grand scheme of things, and almost seems like good value (if anything can truly be 'good' value when it costs the better part of a grand.

The screen is exactly what you'd expect, good colours, nice responsiveness (one thing which worried me was how responsive the pen would be when writing, as it's only a 60Hz display - thankfully it's great), it gets fairly bright, but I'm currently locked out of my house and typing this in the garden on an overcast day, and it's only just bright enough with almost no headroom left.

I did notice while walking with it in my hand or tucked under my arm that becuase it's very dense it does get  a bit tiring, and can be slightly cumbersome to carry for long distances. I'd recommend putting it into a bag or something.

I'm typing this using the keyboard case and I've got say it's much more useable than I expected. The keys are the right sort of shape to hit one one by one (no accidentally pressing three at once) and the trackpad integration seems really god so far. I had a little play around with DeX while on the bus, so didn't really use it, but it's very easy to switch in and out of it.

The cameras seemed a little pointless on paper, but having used them I can see the appeal of just snapping a shot of a piece of paper on your tablet and writing on it the S pen rather thah getting your phone out and having to bluetooth it to yourself. The images it takes are fairly low resolution, but they still look pretty good in all the other ways that matter - realistically, the sorts of people who think it's socially acceptable to take pictures on a tablet will buy something cheaper like a Tab A, or FireHD8.

Finally, the feature that swung it for me and made me decide to actually buy this beatiful thing - the S pen. It's comfortable in the hand, if a little oddly shaped (you get used to it basically immediately), the magnetic charging is a really nice feature, and it was fully charged within minutes, and hasn't dipped much below 100% yet today. Drawing/writing is a smooth experience and feels really nice - the pressure sensitivity is really good and allows you very fine control over your 'brushstroke'. The case also hides the pen very nicely and holds it securely - I wish I'd realised the case had a large adhesive part before I shoddily applied it and had to peel it off (which took a lot of force, this thing isn't falling off any time soon).

Minor issues: the backspace/delete key is in a slightly odd place, and the Fn+DeX combo uses the full reach of one hand for me (from C3 to D4 on a piano). Caps lock has randomly been on by default a few times. I had to spend a good half hour updating everything out of the box (not that this is unusual). I can't seem to change the two finger scroll direction on the trackpad. I've not had a great experience with the fingerprint scanner either - I might try adding the same thumb in landscape and portrait modes (face unlock has been damn-near instant, but you still have to swipe to open the tablet even after it's unlocked).

I haven't had a chance to test the speakers or the video watching experiene as a whole, but honestly that's not somthing I'll be using this tablet for. It cost more than my laptop, and honestly I prefer this keyboard (despite the annoyingly small left shift key), it feels like the best 'netbook' ever created. The keyboard simply pulls off and you can use it as a standalone tablet (this is nice becuase the roughness of the back half of the case gives you something extra to grip - the metal feels premium, and I'd much rather have that than glass on a tablet, but it's very smooth.",2019-09-04 12:50:03

330,"Ask any retailer and they will be happy to explain:

1) Samsung offers steep discounts out of the gate.  This undercuts the value of the device since it is easy to figure out the ""suggested retail"" game where that is only really the price for really foolish people.

2) Most android phones either aren't that expensive to start or, well, come off as cheap. 

3) Android is horribly fragmented and Android phones are not expected to be updated for five years. As a result, many (probably most) aren't designed to last that long. 

4) Like them or not, Apple produces products that look premium, last longer, and will be updated for five years.  Their marketing is also far more sophisticated (and effective).  That gives them the image of premium in a sea of ""cheap"" devices. 

5) Apple does not really discount it products in the same was any Android OEM.  They offer discounts but they are within a formula and otherwise often do have people buying at sticker price.  Microsoft does the same thing with Surface products.  If you pay attention, you know the discount cycle. Between that cycle you pay the full price.  Samsung seemed to be moving that direction but its discounts on S10s and Note 10s suggest they are simply going back to the Android approach with a higher starting price. 

As to how this works out in the real world, I sold my iPhone XR for more than I actually paid (had some credits so it was well under $500 and I sold it for $500 in only a few days.  I also sold my Apple Watch for only $50 less than I paid last year.  When I dumped the Xr (which I hated) and switched to a S10e, my actual cost was less than $100.  When I traded that in on a Note 10, between the $600 trade and more than $100 in additional discounts, it cost me less than $250 to get the Note 10. Built in depreciation before it was released.",2019-09-04 15:07:08

The phone thinks there's an external microphone attached so the internal microphone is switched off.

481,"Personally, before this launched I preferred the design of the Active Series 1 over the Galaxy Watch, but the lack of a rotating bezel was too much of a downgrade for me. This one having a haptic bezel is a great development, but not sure how it will affect battery life and durability in the long term.

I think coming from the Huawei, any of the smaller variants (including the Active Series 1) would be too much of a downsize for you (unless you want that!)

Either the Galaxy Watch 46mm or the Active Series 2 44mm would be great. The Active (pictured) is much more sleek, modern and lightweight, whilst being brighter and more vivid. But the GW is more durable and more traditional

HOWEVER...

There may be a _slight_ change of pace and/or learning curve when coming from Android WearOS to Samsung Tizen! You won't have the same app store or interface, and things like watch faces and preferences aren't transferrable. If you wanted to stick with WearOS, something like the Ticwatch or Fossil devices might be a better experience for you!",2019-09-06 10:00:47
482,"Left apple for the note 9! picked up the samsung buds and watch and could not be happier, except that I dont have the note 10!",2019-09-06 10:05:57
483,I'm not married to WearOS.  I think a lot of the critiques of it are fair enough but they're not deal breaks for me.  For me it seems to just work once I got it all set up.  TBH the appeal of the Samsung to me at the moment is the price since a lot of them are marked down.,2019-09-06 10:07:25
484,"There seems to be a google app for similar ar experiance but as for the samsung app built i dont know, Have a s10 plus and it doesnt have it.",2019-09-06 10:17:25
485,"They are limited because the size of the sensor, they can't put big changes using a 2-3mm size sensor, they need more space to get better things.  
Google was smart enought to see that and they starting to develop their software instead their sensors, Samsung is running in this too,   


I don't use that mode too much, but onething we must really see is how the ""nightmode"" on Pixel (and even on S10) are fucking fantastic.   
I believe we are gonna to see some new things every 2-3 years, just like portrait / blur mode was created 3-4 years ago, then night mode, now the ""TOF"" sensor is what they really putting efforts here, maybe we will see some great things when this sensor become older.",2019-09-06 11:17:32
486,I would rather not mention in case a samsung rep reads this as my plan is to start out unreasonable and negotiate to reasonable.,2019-09-06 11:27:35

488,"Don't worry, S11 will have a huge improved camera. Samsung worked with Xiaomi and together they made a 108MP camera sensor. It's real and it's capable of 6K@30fps, Smart-ISO and is equivalent to a high-end DSLR camera! No, this isn't a rumor it's actually real.

489,Unfortunately that does not confirm which phone will get it other than it's a partnership with Xiaomi. Could be for a Xiaomi phone and not necessarily a Samsung phone.,2019-09-06 11:59:23
490,"Lmao, obviously not. Samsung and Xiaomi both made it for themselves and it's most likely coming to S11. Anyways, we can't do anything but wait and see.",2019-09-06 12:13:57

492,"Note 9 seems like a better deal. I love my 10e and want a green s10 as backup. The Note 10 is a purposeful departure for Samsung and I can't do it. They'll still get my money, just not for note 10. If they continue down this path who knows maybe the 9s and 10s are the last Sammies I touch.",2019-09-06 12:49:12
493,"I disagree, I don't think the s8 looks old and right now I'm holding onto it until someone can figure out how to not have a hole/notch in the screen again. I really feel like the hole in the screen was a step back for samsung",2019-09-06 13:26:17
494,"Ooh, nice! Enjoy! 

I'm really happy with the a70 -its 11pm, I've been using the phone unplugged since 8.50am, and I've been using it all day - Facebook, reddit, pokemon go, and then streaming netflix for the past 2 hours, and I'm on 14% battery still. The UI is fab, I'm using the samsung apps for calendar and email and actually prefer them over the Google ones, which is unheard of for me to choose not to use the stock ones. I'm definitely impressed.",2019-09-06 13:59:16
495,Dont worry. Samsung will remove the charger port once Apple,2019-09-06 14:02:16
496,"IMHO Samsung phone design reached the best with 9 series (i love the Note9), 10 series is far worse and actually overrated.",2019-09-06 14:16:33
497,"What phone do you have? I had the same experience with Samsung. But I've experienced that the lowest ram you need is 6gb. Anything lower than that and the phone gets slower in mere weeks. 
I bought S7 edge, Note 4, Note 5. And sold all of them before a month. Then I got Note9 with 6gb ram and never faced this issue",2019-09-06 14:25:21

499,"1. Yes, all devices slow down over time, that's what software bloat will do for you. Also refresh your OS every now and then, it helps.

2. 5G is a wireless network technology that's not exclusive to Samsung and has nothing to do with the operating speed of the device.",2019-09-06 15:41:40

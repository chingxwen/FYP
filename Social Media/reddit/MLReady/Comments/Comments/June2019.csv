5,"So I have a Samsung UE43NU7400 HDR 4K Ultra HD Smart TV 42"" that I purchased from John Lewis in January. Since then there was what I believe to be backlight bleeding at the top left and right if the screen. They oucked it up and sent it back to me after 10 days in which they said that they replaced the screen. After using it for a bit its clear that the top left bleed which they said themselves was really bad is not completely gone, a lot less but can still see it, as well as this it looks like a new spot had appeared on the left side of the TV at the top. 
I've contacted them and they said a factory reset I should perform, would this even do anything?

I'm personally on my second pair because the first had both the battery issue, and an issue with the proximity sensor.

My S7e shipped manufactured in Vietnam, with a CSC for Panama, and configured for Spanish. Fortunately a friend helped wade through the initial screens and set it to English after which it worked fine.

The OP7P is also having a few random issues (ghost touches and inability to touch in certain areas) and I haven't heard much about their return policy, except for that it isn't great. The curve on the OP7P is also a big difference, because it's not even remotely as perfected as the s10 ones, which still have some issues with palm touches. The selfie camera could also be an issue, because while yes, so far it seems super sturdy and durable, it could fail in years to come, so if OP is looking for more reliable over the years, thsts another issue. The side mounted fingerprint sensor could either be a bonus or a minus, depending on how they feel about it. Same with the UI. Some people love oxygen os, some love one UI.

Mobile data just stops working after 10 seconds on S10+.. please help!

I'm really having a problem with my Samsung Galaxy S10+

I'm hoping you guys can help me. I bought the cheaper ""Singapore"" version of the phone. It's $700 on eBay / Amazon compared to $900 for the U.S version. The phone came new, in the original box, with the original seal. Everything about the phone works great (screen, etc.) except for mobile data.

I'm absolutely perplexed why mobile data can't work properly on this phone. I'm hoping someone knows what the issue is or can help me troubleshoot it!

I'm coming from using a Huawei Mate 20 Pro. My mobile data worked perfectly on this phone. I just turn on mobile data and it works all the time. However, with the Samsung S10+ I turn on mobile data and it works literally for 10 seconds. It's great that it works but only for 10 seconds. If I either put the phone into airplane mode or restart the phone.. the mobile data again works for 10 seconds and then 'shuts off'. I mean mobile data is still technically turned on. But mobile data just stops working and the ""4g"" at the top disappears.

I'm using the AT&amp;T / TMobile network. There's no reason it shouldn't be working properly. When I go into settings on the S10+ and check the network status it shows ""disconnected.""

Please help me.. how can I prevent the phone from disconnecting from the mobile network after 10 seconds? I've never seen this issue with a phone before, so I'm uncertain of what's happening. The mobile data / network still works perfectly in my old Huawei phone.",2019-06-01 19:03:58

149,"The Samsung Doorstep Repair Service is provided by a company called WeFix (Rated 9.5/10 on Trust Pilot as of 03/06/2019).

To give some background, you can arrange one of these 'Doorstep Repairs' through Samsung's website. They do all the latest S and Note devices and tablets. (All the way back to the S5 and Note 4) as well as some A and J devices. All you have to do to get a quote is your postcode. They use genuine parts.

Normally a screen replacement for a Galaxy Note 9 is £229 (a free battery replacement is included) but I managed to win a competition on the Samsung Members app where I received a screen replacement using doorstep repairs for free.

Now the booking experience is quite simple, you can select multiple things to be repaired, like the screen, cameras, battery (by itself), ear piece speaker, back glass and the charging port.
You can select any weekday to get a repair but do note that you cannot chose a time slot (more on that).

After booking my doorstep repair I waited until the day of the repair, where at 8am I received both an email and a text message from WeFix informing me of the hour time slot for my repair, as well as the name of the technician who would be repairing my device.

So I waited a few hours until about 11am (about in the middle of the time slot I was given) and the technician arrived in his van. (The vans are quite easy to spot as they have WeFix and lots of information on every side - it's not just a plain white van).

The technician was quite friendly and inspected my device quickly before taking it back to his van and repairing it. The whole repair took about an hour, with the screen and the battery being tested. As well, my device was tested to make sure it was still water resistant.

When I received my device back, I inspected it myself and it was done brilliantly. Another nice touch is that a plastic screen protector was also applied (and quite precisely) which is good because my screen was previously scratched a fair bit.

I also received a discount code that would take 10% off any future repair through WeFix.

Overall, the experience and the repair were very good and I would recommend them to anyone who wishes to have their Samsung device repaired.

However, one negative of the experience was the amount of emails I received after the repair, about 4 or 5 I got in total after about a day or two afterwards. These emails were all about recommending and reviewing WeFix. I wouldn't mind one or two but 5 is excessive and quite irritating.

If you want any further clarification on anything or have any questions, I will try my best to answer them and I hope you found this helpful and a little bit informative.

Sorry if it went on for a bit long and thanks for reading!",2019-06-03 10:09:48

189,"I've owned the buds since launch. I use them as commuter earphones, I do my heavy listening on Shure se846s using the ifi xdsd connected to my S8+.

The good: convenience. The buds are fantastic if you're using a galaxy phone, I've had no issues with using them. They're by far the most convenient pair of buds out there for a galaxy phone. 

The features are fantastic too: wireless charging, a voice-enhancing hear through feature and built in voice assistant makes these fantastic for daily use. I tend to leave my phone in my bag and just use the voice assistant to control everything.

The price: they're dirt cheap obviously, around 100 - 120 euros last I checked, provided you're not actually buying them directly from Samsung. Can't complain about the price.

The bad: the sound. As much as I love them, and as much as I use them, I would not recommend them as a main pair of earbuds. They don't support the AptX codec. They sound better using Dolby Atmos, barely. The bass is ok, but anything in the mids and highs is going to be lacking compared to a wired pair of a similar price.",2019-06-04 05:18:15

Also try out Samsung Internet, it's kinda strange but it has a built in place for adblocker and a bunch of safety features, like not accepting cookies or smart anti tracking. The main reason to use samsung's apps is that they look clean and most importantly, they ALL have dark mode. Also depending on your region and if you want to use your phone for purchases, use Samsung Pay. It will work at places with or *without* NFC because it has a chip that sends a magnetic field into the card swiper that mimics the card securely.

Personally, i feel theyre in properly when i feel them blocking all sound/wind from entering where the inner piece sits. I might just prefer a tighter fit or something. Again, that upper part i twist them into do hurt after prolonged use but i just live with it i guess. They dont always get to this position everytime i put them in, sometimes i need to retry or twist them a bit.

I remember seeing an ad on youtube for these buds where the athlete did a twist to put them in, idk if that was just advertising making them look more appealing or if that is how theyre supposed to be put in properly.

If they just made them all to do so, I feel like they could better advertise them as something unique, like the Samsung Gear Twist Buds lol",2019-06-04 11:05:08

Samsung didn't get to where they are today by ignoring business fundamentals. They charge for products whatever the market will bear.

When the demand for the 9 goes down, I imagine they will lower the price. You also may find it for a better price if you look somewhere other than Samsung for it.

I also do all of my practice on it as well like tasks from physic or math (bc I can have my calculator, solutions and yt floating above split screen view of notes and tasks like it's so much more convenient than having notebook book and workbook as well as the calculator all around you xd (especially if you do most of your shit in bed like me xd)

Except in this case it didn't and yet despite them advertising it as withstanding regular swimming they refute warranty because someone swam with it. Honestly after my wasted time with a Fit-e - or I suppose Samsung's sorry excuse for software that is the Wearable - and reading stuff in this reddit, my view of Samsung isn't what it used to be.

306,"Yeh, I understand where you’re coming from as the design doesn’t seem very Samsung-esque. And yeh, leakers aren’t always 100% right, so there is a smudge of hope that the Note10 will be something entirely different.",2019-06-06 13:41:31
307,"I'm worried... Even though I have Galaxy Buds (they're currently with Samsung getting the charging case replaced because I lost it - side note, $77 AUD - roughly $50 USD before tax - for a replacement case, much cheaper than I was expecting), I still want a headphone jack, because I have multiple pairs of headphones, including wired studio headphones, which I like to plug into my phone.

I guess I could just get the S10+ (or I guess I don't really *need* an upgrade, I have the S8+), but I was hoping that I'd like the Note 10, because I've wanted a phone with the S Pen ever since I got the Galaxy Tab S4.

I guess we'll see",2019-06-06 13:42:35
308,"I thought the S10 did it perfectly. It had a headphone jack, *and* shipped with free wireless headphones if you pre-ordered. Maybe the Galaxy Buds should have been taken as a warning, but I guess I was hoping that the S10 having a headphone jack despite being launched with wireless headphones was a good sign for the future of headphone jacks.

I bought Galaxy Buds for my S8+ (then proceeded to lose the case after less than a week - Samsung are able to replace it for a decent price, luckily, it just has to go through their repair channels), so I guess the lack of a headphone jack won't affect me too much. But I guess I just like the idea of being able to use whatever headphones I like at any time. Some apps (*glares at Twitch*) don't correctly sync their audio with video when using wireless headphones, so I like to have wired headphones on hand for those cases.

As it stands, this is a rumour. There were also rumours that the S8 wouldn't have a headphone jack, and it did (iirc the S10 has similar rumours), so I'm still holding out hope. But if it is true, I'm just hoping that they handle it in a decent way (like having a dongle with a high-quality DAC and fast charging passthrough included in the box, as an example).",2019-06-06 13:50:10
309,I am thinking of switching from the iPhone XS Max to the note 10 but I’m afraid to make the move. I don’t know if I will regret it. I’ve had an iPhone since the 6S plus and had Samsung phones before that. I missed the excitement of an android phone.,2019-06-06 14:38:19
310,"Samsung does make an AMOLED screen with a center hole punch though. I saw it in the patent submissions the year before they brought out the S10's, and other OEMs have been using them. Sadly, this could be it. I, too, hope not as any disfigurement of the screen is a step back, and double so with the removal of the 3.5mm jack. I hope this is some Samsung marketing person goofing us all for some lulz.",2019-06-06 15:00:05

318,"After Note 9 I find myself using the jack less and less. It's helpful when the battery is low, but I've had too many headphone jacks damaged due to cable strain or tangles on my previous phones. I do get connectivity issues with BT devices but it is more often on the part of the device itself than the phone (though, I have noticed a certain ""death grip"" on the Note 9). I'm more disappointed Samsung is not fully embracing high quality audio codecs that are widely used such as AptX HD and keeping their ""Scalable codec"" exclusive to the buds..",2019-06-06 18:52:35
319,"I hate this design, I hate that it doesn't have a headphone jack. My preference for Samsung devices have come to an end.",2019-06-06 19:40:57

322,"Hmm, yeh it is definitely a pity. If you do want to upgrade and are willing to pay a premium, the S10 5G is always an option worth considering. Unlike the Note10, it has a headphone jack and I’m very sure that Samsung would just reuse the display, camera and performance of the S10 5G in the upcoming Pro version of the Note. So you won’t be missing out on much.

Of course, if that S Pen is something you really care about, you really have no option other than to go with the Note9. It’s still a great phone, but of course, it’s no longer the best Samsung offers.",2019-06-06 22:28:22
323,"This was supposed to be an enthusiast phone, but they're just taking features away from us... the 3.5mm headphone Jack will be severely missed and come on, it's the performance series!


Also with a hole punch in the middle I would just rather have a full fledged notch, I presumed that the whole point of the hole punch camera cutout was to put it out of the way, not in the middle where it's impossible to hide.

The s10 5g is perfect and the cutout manages to be on your peripheral vision not RIGHT WHERE everything is going to get on it's way.

I dont get it, Samsung was supposed to save us from badly designed phones, not give us one...",2019-06-06 23:55:02
324,"If I were you, I’d save your money. The XS Max should suffice for a couple of years, and by then, we hopefully might start seeing Apple or Samsung implementing cameras under the display. Even better, we might see evolutions of foldable phones like the Galaxy Fold that may have glass displays instead of plastic. Phones are about to get super exciting, but we’re currently in that awkward stage where the tech is not so ready yet, so compromises have to be made (hole-punch, notches, pop-out camera etc).",2019-06-07 00:03:17
325,"Yeh hopefully, these rumours are all wrong and Samsung just gives us a bigger S10 with a S-Pen. That would be perfect imo.",2019-06-07 00:11:36

327,"I completely agree! Not only does the vertical camera set-up make it look a lot like a P30 Pro clone, it’s also very reminiscent of the A Series phones Samsung makes. That I do not like at all.",2019-06-07 00:18:59
328,"Looks great. Pretty un-samsung and more Sony-esque. I am having some real buyer's remorse after getting the S10+ in late May, not waiting for the Note.",2019-06-07 00:20:18
329,"For now, the phone won't charge and turn on, after the overheating drained the battery. There is no sign of charging (red indicator light) while plugged in, also tried different Samsung chargers, and outlets.",2019-06-07 00:38:36
330,"I think these renders are fake, Samsung and get rid of their Bixby button? For me nosense, it is their proud and they still ddvelop it. So also I am doubt about missing headphone jack.",2019-06-07 00:56:54
331,"Yeh I get you, but i think I think a lot of manufactures like Samsung and Apple are in that awkward stage where foldable phones and cameras under the display aren’t ready yet. So for now, we may have to compromise with these notches and punch-holes, but I expect Samsung to bounce back once the technology is ready. In a few years, we could expect a Galaxy Fold with a cheaper price and a glass display instead of the less reliable plastic display it’s using now. So, I would tell you to keep the Note9 and wait a couple of years to see real innovation.",2019-06-07 01:31:42

Tried it in a T-Mobile store, and holy god, the input lag on the screen is terrible. I could never get used to that. It would bug me every single day.

So I gave Samsung a second chance and ran with a Note 9. I'm glad I did. This thing is snappy as hell and is still holding up well. My 7 Edge started slowing down within the first 6 months and was *horrendous* after a year. I still don't know what the hell made it so slow, since plenty of people online said theirs worked great after 2 years. But the Note 9 is probably the best phone I've ever owned.",2019-06-07 05:19:09

This would be a shame as Samsung makes that display for OP, so it should be in their flagship phone of 2019, right? And also, the camera setup is going to be staying the same from the S10 series, which is sad as the primary sensor has pretty much stayed the same since the S7.

381,"Hey there! 
Thanks for the follow up message. 

TL;DR: I do not regret it at all. 

In longer, there were couple issues I faced with a phone for the past couple month. However, all of them are fixable via 3rd party apps, apk's or other tricks. 
In-screen FP scanner works 2-3 times faster than couple months ago. Galaxy buds are stable now. No issues with sounds desync or anything like that. 
The only regret I have - color choice. Black color is too simple. White looks cool AF! Wish to rewind and change it to white ... 

In regards to Apple. I do not belive in 5G. I mean, it is cool. Faster speed and anything like that BUT. The area where I live, I don't even have all stable 4 bars of LTE. Connection is not always that stable with LTE, so 5G won't change anything + too early to tell. 

X is a good phone. As I said couple months ago, if you don't have any issues with a phone. If it sufficient enough for you - just keep it. 
If you must switch to something - definitely try Samsung.",2019-06-07 11:10:53

Imit does support map my run and I believe Strava as well. I usually just load up a run on the Samsung health app on my watch and then also run with my phone for the Nike run club. I also can't sync my heart rate to NRC either, but this isn't an issue with the watch per se.

I also wear my phone at work and it's great to quickly view notifications on my watch rath aser than pulling my phone out. You can also reply to messages on platforms like WhatsApp and messenger, it has a to format of text, but I don't particularly like that. 

One of the major downsides for me is the battery life. I get maximum of 2 days usually, and it takes about 2 hours to charge. This can be annoying, particularly for me when I may work a triplet of 13 hour shifts with a run after each shift... I sometimes completely forget it needs charging, and I ideally want at least 30 percent before I go out on a run.

As I generally like to keep track of my health, I use Samsung health anyways and it's been ok, I feel like things could be better, but it's good. I like how it measures my sleep every night I have it on and measures my heart rate at intervals.

454,See the real problem is that Samsung Apps and Themes app is almost as bad as the Reddit app. It can't do basic tasks even. What really happen is that your search failed and it shows an empty screen.,2019-06-09 06:59:28
455,"Yeah. You'll need not the screen but the display itself to be replaced. You can try to search online for it and do the repair yourself but you'll lose the IP rating. And if you ask Samsung, it'll cost you a lot.",2019-06-09 07:49:21
456,"App support is lacking, most manufacturers have ditched it, the SoCs are generally one year behind, the software isn't as polished as iOS, and there aren't really any killer features for consumers*.

That being said, it's still Android, and the high end tablets are still alright.

*if you like having a portable desktop experience then DeX is great on Samsung tablets, you can even run full desktop Linux on it (this is also possible on recent Samsung flagships but you'd need an external monitor)",2019-06-09 08:33:52
457,"After 6.5 days of use...

**Galaxy Fit Pros:** 

\- Very light and small tracker. But device itself is a little thicker than the Charge 3.  

\- Clearer, higher-resolution screen than the Charge 3.  It's nice to be able to clearly read what a notification says. 

\- A little easier to see in direct sunlight than the Charge 3.  Still not perfect. 

\- Heart rate and step count accuracy seems comparable to my Charge 3.  Whew!

\- **Synching/notifications work flawlessly** (with my Pixel 3a).  Changing a clock face is instantaneous.  Vibrations are strong.  

\- ""Do Not Disturb"" mode, ""Good Night"" mode, both easily accessible from band.  No hunting around for hard-to-find settings on tracker or app.  

\- Can set display brightness from 1-10 on tracker.

\- I really like the Samsung Health app.  I particularly like that it actually tells me what it is doing when it is synching.  It tells me what data it is downloading from the device.  Very nice to see instead of Fitbit's useless ""progress bar."" 

\- The band auto-detected ""workouts"" when I was walking and mowing the lawn.  Very nice.  Couldn't select ""mowing lawn"" as a workout category, though. 

\- Not sure if this is a pro or con, but the display turns on when you make an arm movement that is anywhere close to lifting your hand to your face.  The Fitbit Charge 3 was the opposite -- sometimes I had to make an exaggerated arm movement just to get the display to turn on. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Galaxy Fit Cons:**

\- Poor battery life so far.  Just 3 days with HR set to ""Always"".  Looks like maybe 4-5 days with it set to ""Frequent"" (every 10 minutes when not working out).  Must have to turn off notifications to get the advertised ""about a week.""

\- Band is not particularly comfortable, and is very hard to adjust tighter, once you've got it on.  Easier just to take it off and start over.  Worried about durability of band due to having to fold the end ""under"" when putting it on.  People with small wrists might not like this band.  

\- Although there are many variations of clock faces to choose from, they're not customizable.  You have to pick your poison from the available 24 choices.  Get ready to see some pinks/yellows/reds on your clock face. 

\- **Resting** heart rate seemed comparable to what Fitbit told me until I switched the Heart Rate setting from ""Always"" to ""Frequent.""  With it set to Frequent, the resting heart rate number doesn't seem even close anymore. 

\- I regularly see different little icons show up at the top of the clock face, but I have no idea what they are supposed to indicate. 

\- When I get more than one notification at a time, I'm not sure how to see more than the first one.  Scrolling/back doesn't seem to do it.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sad that the battery life seems worse than advertised, and I am not a fan of the band on this device (I hope replacement bands become available on Amazon soon), but I do plan to wear the Galaxy Fit until a better option comes along.   Samsung should sell a lot of these at the $99 price-point (assuming they ever officially go on sale).",2019-06-09 09:31:24

MST allows the Galaxy A70 to emulate the swiping action of your debit card at payment terminals that lack NFC.""

And second of all Samsung does *not* install Facebook on your phone. What Samsung installs is the Facebook App Manager/Installer, which is basically a placeholder app that only prompts you you to download Facebook (the actual app) if opened.

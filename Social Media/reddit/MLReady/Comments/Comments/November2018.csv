Samsung phones have a skin that allows for nearly infinite customization, which is great if that’s your thing. I really love customization, so that would be my top pick. If you can afford the nite 9 or s9/S9+, obviously I’d go for those...but the S8/note 8 are still fully capable phones.

I think an apple battery swap is 69 after this current “we are embarrassed” 29 dollar discount. 

I see both markets.. and while you dislike iOS, the hardware keeps its value and use, while still getting first party upgrades. Samsung just releases low end new phones and calls it good. 

I’d personally rather go for one that’s not cheaper due to using crappier components. ",2018-11-02 13:43:35
106,"Speed in phones isn't all. Firstly you guys dropped the fingerprint sensor... for a notch... You use Samsung OLED technology and pretty much pass it off as an apple innovation, OLED comes froom 2002 or somewhere close to that.

Apple will last longer, with less features, be more polished and cost more. Samsung will last 2-3 years, more features, can be buggier, can game better than Iphones due to their superior GPUs, have better useability (headphone jack, USB-C etc.) Apple phones do maintain their value, but if you have a trade in plan it makes no difference, or if you use it until it dies it makes no difference. Repairing an S-Device is cheaper than an Apple device. The Samsung eco-system co-ensides with the Andriod one making it much more universal for the mainstream PC users, or anyone who does enterprise/business/server based work. I can run python code on it for example.

Even if you have those issues you stated with S-deives, try the pixel. Pixels are supperior to Apple devices in nearly everyway, (excluding the XL's notch, eww) Firstly, the products last, they get supported for just as long as Apple devices, they get the BEST ecosystem currently available, they are nearly as fast as an IPhone, have a fingerprint sensor and face scanning, etc. etc. 

Again, Apple has its place for people who do not want a feature rich phone, someone who wants a super easy to use device and cannot follow the Andriod ecosystem. However they're overpriced, practically scam you at repairs (do I need to get Louis Rossman?)

The ONLY component that is worse on andriod devices is the CPU, EVERYTHING else equal, or in some cases better, take the batteries, I don't know ANY flagship andriod phone that came out this year with a smaller battery. I don't know of ANY andriod phone that came out this year without an SD card reader. 

Again, personal preferance, but I like to be able to tinker with my device, if you wish to not do that then fine.

This is why there's Isheep. You don't fully look at the specs of these devices, you don't fully research the life the and look at value charts.

i mean, the Tab S4 is REALLY AWESOME ... if only it had been released in late 2016 and not summer 2018.  

LTE, 256GB of storage &amp; 6GB of ram is fantastic. and yeah Amoled rules all and the S-Pen is genius. loving this stuff. but at this $1000 price point, this config should be STANDARD and also include the SD845, with a Huawei-like guarantee that the S4 will be lag-free for 18 months. 

just got a security update yesterday, which takes me to the October update. but prior to that, it was stuck on June/July. will count my blessings if this gets updated to Pie someday, but i doubt it'll get much further than that.

and Theme Support, which spans the entire line up of Samsung phones, is missing from the tablet line. i mean COME ON. throw us tablet users a bone here, Samsung! an entire monthly MAGAZINE showcasing theme developers, but not one crummy theme for the Tab S3/S4? i mean at least give users a theme engine. how hard could it be port it from the Note 8/9 series?

The longer answer is that the notches allegedly cost less to manufacture (possibly due to where / how the display is connected to the board), and patents for things like curved displays can be prohibitively expensive or impossible for other companies to license from Samsung.

Samsung also has tremendous manufacturing capability; their fabrication facilities are much larger than most of their competitors.

As far as your downsides, I agree with you on Bixby. I never use assistants ever - I'm usually in a public setting where I feel weird talking to my phone, it's usually faster to just use the touchscreen instead, and speech to text isn't super accurate. I never use Bixby or Assistant, and I wish I could do things without assistants getting shoved in my face - Cortana, Assistant, Bixby, Alexa, etc. Just no. I however love the Bixby button; after remapping it with bxActions, it's so great to have a hardware back button. I could never go without that button anymore. I do love the 18:9 aspect ratio. My phone is about the same physical size as my previous Pixel XL, but it has waaaaay more screen real estate. I love it, it's great for browsing Reddit or watching TV.

182,"Every TV built in the past 15 years (smart TVs or tvs that have a menu and can accept digital signal of any type) has a suite of debugging/testing tools built within that are either accessible through pressing of a few buttons on the remote in a very specific order, or through a special ""debug"" port where all you need to connect is either a PC with a special piece of software installed, or a special debugging remote that gives you instant and direct access to said suite of software.

From the looks of it, this is a (as you can very obviously read on the right) spectrum analyzer of the signal received through the TV antenna. I have no idea how to disable or (or enable it for that matter) and your best luck would be if some Samsung engineer or repair shop owner would find his own way here and tell you what to specifically do to disable this.

The best I can personally tell you is to unplug your TV for 24 hours and while off to press random the buttons on the TV to hopefully squeeze whatever power it has left anywhere on the inside and hope it will do a soft reset when it turns back on.",2018-11-04 09:22:30

184,"This probably won't work for you, given the info others have already provided, but I did find this web page on Samsung's website, and it has a section for doing a factory reset on ""Older Models"", which your set probably is if you've really had it for 10+ years.

https://www.samsung.com/au/support/tv-audio-video/smart-tv-how-to-perform-a-factory-data-reset/

Basically, while the TV is on, press and hold the Exit button on the Samsung remote control for 12 seconds, after which the TV should display a warning dialog which you can use the remote control to choose ""OK"" on which does a full factory reset.

With that said, I'm in agreement here with others that the image you're seeing is likely somehow coming from your cable provider, since it only appears when you apparently have the cable connected to the back of the set.

You could test this theory (whether the image is coming from your cable provider or not) by connecting a different television to the cable and seeing whether or not you see this image on that TV.

185,"First off; I've worked at Tmobile for 3 years.

Your analysis is spot on.

When someone comes in with an S7/S7 edge the grand majority (85%+) are doing whatever they can to replace it or have it ""fixed"". Where as when people come in with even the iphone 6 maybe 10-20% are having an issue. Most want to replace them because they feel ""its time"".

I've learned that many samsung devices do very poorly with software as its upgraded. When someone comes in with a Note 3 / S5 its typically a stun if they work well.

I've been a note person since the Note3 and never had issues because I changed my phone yearly. Most people cant do that.

I do feel like Samsung hopefully beat that curve with the S8 series devices and should have more regularly long lasting devices from this point (at least 3-4 years commonly). Time will tell.

[This Samsung support page](https://support.samsungknox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012597828-Can-I-to-backup-Secure-Folder-data-) indicates the app has a backup feature that sends the data contained in the Secured Folder, to the Samsung Cloud servers. The available space on this cloud storage seems to vary depending on the phone's storage space, from 16 GB to 64 GB. The [official page](https://www.samsungknox.com/fr/solutions/personal-apps/secure-folder) about the feature also shows [this series of screenshots](https://kp4-cdn.samsungknox.com/img/ubDblM0nPwzRsVnS.jpg), that show the feature is made to backup GBs of data automatically.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems the issue of the app using background data, even when asked to not do this, is a common one: I found multiple threads about it online, none had any explanation unfortunately.

[This one](https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/forums/v3_1/forumtopicpage/board-id/OtherMobile/thread-id/15029/page/1), on the Samsung community platform, even took an ugly turn: a Samsung moderator/technician seems to be have became aggressive and very unprofessional - so much that another Samsung moderator had to remove all their messages to not risk a scandal - when responding to a calm and civil question of a Samsung customer about the odd issue.

I haven't used Secure Folder (ex-Knox) yet, but I suspect the app is either:

\- uploading some encryption information (keys and such, several are already on the device, including hardware-based ones) to their servers, for law-enforcement purposes (remember that it got the greenlight of a certain agency years ago, which mean they have been working directly with them for long enough)

\- uploading some ""telemetry"" data for their own internal usage (so downloading all sorts of information about your device and how it's used)

I found something called Smart Alert, that vibrates the phone when you pick it up if you missed any messages or calls. I have disabled that and hopefully this will stop",2018-11-06 03:34:33

244,"I appreciate the help and response. 

I didn't have Backup and Restore enabled in Secure Folder. I've never added my account in there either. 

It's difficult to say though. If I look at the Apps setting menu and I look at Secure Folder, it'll say it hasn't used any mobile data. But under Mobile Data Usage, it says it has used 16mb this month. I don't know. 

Either way, yeah, I guess it's kind of a weird feature. I've always been kind of weary of Secure Folder. I thought it was weird it would have a cloud backup feature. I thought that kind of defeated the purpose of it. Also, the fact that there's a retrieve/reset password function on Secure Folder suggests to me that Samsung backs up the encryption keys as well. 
",2018-11-06 06:03:44
245,"Thanks for the follow-up, it's quite an intriguing situation indeed.

I think you should trust the Mobile Data Usage over the Secure Folder app regarding the bandwidth consumption, many other users report large amount of data usage (visible on their telco website and bills!), despite the Secure Folder app saying it's not using anything.

I think the Secure Folder feature on Samsung phones is only meant to provide minimum data security against random smartphone thieves off the street, stealing a corporate (or [BYOD/COPE/POCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device)) device, not knowing it's not just a strictly personal one.

Looking at Knox various products, they all seem geared toward one goal: allowing corporations to restrict, backup, lock, locate and remote-wipe a fleet of devices. It does not protect against invasive surveillance agencies, big corps spying on home users, or fully-fledged industrial espionage.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I gathered, *Secure Folder* is basically making all Samsung smartphone users an *employee* of the Samsung corp, in a Knox environment: **Samsung** can backup, lock, locate and remote-wipe all ""their"" Samsung devices, not the users themselves.

So, while as an *employee* of the Samsung corp, you can ask them to do all these actions for you, by logging in on your Samsung account - they're still the ones with all the admin rights and access to the Knox tools installed on ""your"" device.

**The user is definitely not the admin** here, despite being the legal owner of the smartphone (as a physical good).

\_\_\_

PS: thinking a little more about it, it's the sort of trade-off that usually comes with a seemingly ""free"" service: with *Secure Folder*, the user does not need to set up their own backup/remote-lock/wipe server, nor do all the maintenance work (patching, tweaking, etc), nor pay anyone to do that job for them - but in return the user does not control the system's settings at all: **Samsung got all the keys** and do whatever they want with these.

At this point, *if you're not using your own encryption tools,* it's choosing between giving your confidential data to a potential thief (if the device ever gets stolen or lost), or giving it to *Samsung &amp; Associates* right from the start.

It reminds me of security products (like BitDefender) installing [Man In The Middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) exploits on their users' devices, to see their encrypted traffic, to supposedly analyze it and detect any malware/phishing attempts: what is the point of a security software, if it bring such a massive vulnerability to the device?

Here, what is the point of securing confidential data, if it's only to give it all to *Samsung &amp; Associates* ?  

I can't even imagine how incredibly powerful an unlimited access to Samsung's Knox servers would be: accessing the most valuable data of millions of devices, with an automatic updating service keeping the data fresh and accurate.",2018-11-06 07:03:59

Also, this thing will definitely cost a fortune. It's basically twice the hardware three times the displays. O.O

308,"It seems like a pretty straightforward answer - ipad pro. Maybe it is in general.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT...here's my two cents (note: I haven't used any ipad pros, nor any chromebooks)

I never understood this 'productivity tablet' thing. Especially for a 10"" device. I don't know how good ipad pro is at various tasks, but it seems like a niche productivity device - it's good at drawing and various other graphics work, at least the 13""  version. Everything else is just marketing mumbo jumbo to get you to buy the crazy expensive garbage keyboards. Maybe it's also good at note taking and things like that, but that is where Samsung excels as well.

For me personally, S4 beats the ipad because it's a far better media consumer device - screen ratio, amoled &gt; 120Hz, storage expandability. Plus, I love DEX as well. I don't understand this 'apps not updated for tablet'\* thing. Built-in apps are awesome. Plex runs fine, Kodi and VLC as well and I use Telegram without any issues. All in all, I find this device to sit deeply in the 'better than the sum of its parts' territory.

&amp;#x200B;

I also got the POGO dock for the S4 for cheap (\~$30). Currently the daily board is just a glorified photo frame, if that, but supposedly S4 will get Bixby voice in 2019, and I hope they improve the daily board to act more as a smart display. One good thing about the POGO dock is that it's as good as wireless chargers, in that you just place the tab in it and it charges. It takes a couple of attempts to learn how to quickly lock the pins, but after that it just, well, clicks :). One great downside of the dock is that you can't use it with Samsung's covers. I have a book cover (non-keyboard) and it covers the pogo pins as well, and even if it didn't, it makes the thing too thick to fit in the slot.

As you can see in the video, when I tap on the display for shooting, the crosshair doesn't stay on the target and moves erratically on it's own. This makes it impossible to aim and shoot on this phone.

This affects all the shooting games that I have tested, PUBG, Dead Trigger 1 &amp; 2, NOVA Legacy. The touch works fine otherwise, for the things like typing and launching apps.

This phone was bought online, and when I asked for a replacement, they asked me to get a 'defect certificate' from the authorized service center. When I went to the service center, the guy told me that he didn't care what happens in third party games. There aren't even first party games by Samsung, are there? He offered me a solution, to DELETE the games. What a solution!

I am a Crown 1 player in PUBG, just 18 points shy of becoming Ace this season. I was Ace in the last season. This phone has become a dead weight for me because it's impossible to shoot a target accurately.

It's a completely new UI it's not like apples ""new UI"" where nothing actually changes it just has a swipe up instead of a home button. OneUI changes literally everything. That's a substantial amount of work per phone model. Another reason is they want and need people to switch from note 8 to note 9 and before OneUI I don't think anyone can really justify an upgrade from the note 8 to note 9. 

That's just my opinion on this specific issue. I still receive updates on my s6 that I use as a backup. But thankfully they don't try to push UI updates like Apple does killing the battery life and speed of the older phones. 

Just because we don't get new UI updates for 5 years doesn't mean it's a bad thing. New UI's are optimized for new hardware. Old hardware struggles to run them. ",2018-11-08 10:33:16

393,"&gt;Now, we don’t have any reason yet to doubt the validity of this report, but given what we know this simply raises a lot of questions. One UI is Samsung’s new UX that’s based on Android 9 Pie, just like Samsung Experience 9.0 was Samsung’s UX for Android 8.0 Oreo and Samsung Experience 9.5 was their UX for Android 8.1 Oreo. Samsung has previously confirmed that Android Pie would be coming to the Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8, and a handful of A series and J series phones. It seems unlikely that Samsung would backtrack on releasing Android Pie for the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy Note 8, but it also seems unlikely to us that they would roll out an Android Pie update without the new interface changes in One UI. After all, that would mean Samsung has to maintain multiple versions of their Android Pie software, and not just add/remove whatever features they deem inaccessible for older devices.

&gt;It is possible that the spokesperson gave out incomplete information, so we reached out to Samsung Mobile for clarification and will update this article if we hear back from them.

Like you said, Apps are better on iOS. Most of them are native and use OS features like TouchID/FaceID properly. My banking app on Android doesn't support fingerprint authentication, but it does on iOS? A lot of Android Apps are just web pages in wrappers. 

If you play any games on your phone - iOS is the place to be. I'm not a big phone gamer, I typically play crossword puzzles. But some of the best games in that genre are on iOS. 

But, there is the walled garden of Apple. It's not as big of a deal as r/Samsung makes it out to be but it is there. How much do you customize your phone? Do you use a file explorer often?

446,"On the every company will adopt this but Samsung being first note, aren’t most companies already trying to be predictive and gesture based to improve navigation anyways? Like just within stock Android P there are so many gestures, predictive actions and google assistant triggers to help minimize user interaction . In the cases of contacts and clock, a lot of the top UI elements are elements you shouldn't want to interact with frequently. Contacts for example, the button on the top prevents accidental activation of edits while also freeing up space and clutter from the bottom for things you actually use. If you want an example for how cluttering around the bottom can lead to confusion, just look at iOS 12's messages app, almost all the actions are on the bottom half of the screen, all the iMessage apps, media inputs and of course the keyboard. Yes, everything is reachable, but all the different menu tabs and layers just make everything confusing. I think that while the gesture ideas from One UI are a move in the right step, just plain moving everything to the bottom but having pop-ups and layers is just silly. iOS's implementation of bars at the bottom of most apps, first or third party still looks to work well compared to Android's top accessible side menus. Having the most important actions on the bottom - great, putting everything down there - confusing. Though my opinion may not matter, my fingers are long enough to handle a Note 9 or a XS Max in one hand.

FYI, Apple still has their guidelines, now renamed the Human Interface Guidelines, available for macOS, iOS, tvOS and WatchOS.

TLDR, gestures already work for most of the screen and predictive suggestions are already working on reducing user actions anyways. Is Samsung really first?",2018-11-09 07:29:32

448,"Idk... I'm not all that excited. Seems like some of the ""improvements"" come with drawbacks. Like in the messaging app, you have huge MESSAGES on the top half of the screen, but why? When you start scrolling, conversations fill up the whole screen regardless.. Same with Bixby screen. Why do I need huge Hi, Name on the top? I get that it moves content down but I rather have more, nicely laid out content and information than black space.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not some big revolution, iOS figured it out from the beginning when it comes to one handed use. have tabs on the bottom, use swipe gestures anywhere to go back, have interaction menus on the bottom, etc. When Google introduced tabs on the top, at least at first they supported swiping between them, but with time they retracted all that and now with MD2 their apps are shifting to what UI/UX that iOS has been using for ages. I don't blame them, it just works, especially with constantly increasing phone sizes. Now Samsung realizes that it is the way to go as well.

&amp;#x200B;

It was just funny to see Samsung talk about improving UX and essentially showing how they are making their skin more and more like iOS. Again don't get me wrong, I like change but I think they want to put a spin on what iOS has been doing for years, but I don't think it is functionally better. Also, iOS is far from perfect and whoever decided to put the control center in the top right corner should really not be making decisions again :D",2018-11-09 07:37:17

Samsung, on the other side, designs Exynos SoC with built in modem and the custom cores (like Apple) but then **it is Samsung themselves that make** the chip. Unfortunately, due to Qualcomm and some US carriers, the Samsung modem can't be in the US phones, so Samsung has to put a Qualcomm chip in the US version of the phone. By doing this you won't get a fully designed by Samsung hardware. BTW Qualcomm is also killing modding and competition by forcing other companies to always use their chip, maybe in the future these carriers will drop CDMA and we'll get the same phone worldwide with same nodding and quicker updates.

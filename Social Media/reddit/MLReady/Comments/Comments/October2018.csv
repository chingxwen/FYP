1,"Correct. I am saying, I liked my iPhone, but samsung pay specifically kept calling me back. I loved the whole process, MST, rewards, all of it was nice. 

But now they have made the rewards way worse, points are harder to get, and you cant bank them. Also with them steering towards dropping MST. Now nothing is going to keep calling me back to android for now ",2018-09-30 08:26:33

3,"Yes. I am saying I loved samsung pay because of: 

#1- Points

#2- Rewards 

#3- MST

12,"The fact they have removed it from their flagship watch, and their response in various media outlets since that launch is that MST isnt as needed anymore, so they didnt put it in the watch. Some day that will move to the phones. 

Also correct if no one is doing rewards, and samsung is basically doing no rewards then no reason to go with them for that. That just puts them on a equal field, so I might as well go with the one that comes with the phone I like",2018-09-30 09:28:23
13,"I give up trying to tell you everyone's opinions are different, and I just see it as an isolated case, along with most other issues you told me to look up

From your perspective I could be ignorant af, and maybe I am. Maybe Samsung devices do have shit batteries, and I basically wasted money on a note 9 with a 4000mah battery that'll degrade to 2000mah after two years, who knows?

Issue here is, no one's actually did solid scientific research about if Samsung's batteries degrade faster than others (I might be wrong tho, if it exists, some good Samaritan could send a link to that research and I'll do some night reading), so no matter how much we argue, we're both going nowhere due to insufficient evidence (a post online saying their batteries died in an hour, doesn't really count as one, too many variables)",2018-09-30 10:27:42
14,"For everyone saying MST is still better than all the other options and a reason to stick with Samsung.  It will only be a feature/gimmick for a little bit of time.  As time goes on, more and more retailers are implementing NFC payment terminals.  How long do you think MST is going to stand out as a ""Samsung Feature"".  

Nvm that the trusty credit card still works fine at 100% of locations lol

edit:  lol downvote all you want, but good luck trying to differentiate between other payment systems the more retailers put out NFC terminals.  ",2018-09-30 10:42:29
15,"It's just silly to defend them on things like they are infallible when they are clearly not perfect.  I prefer Samsung phones for their functionality and screens, but would tell anyone that their batteries are total shit because this isn't my first one with the issue, also I think all the ""major"" phone players are extremely anti consumer in their phone designs of the past 6 years, planned obsolescence forcing upgrades when your battery starts to go out because the design is made specifically to hinder repair or upgrade.  Iphones are just as bad with them slowing down the actual phone speed even on older models through software updates",2018-09-30 10:58:03
16,"I would suggest to keep everything at stock - don't go installing themes and icons and use the phone as is. When you start changing themes etc  that's when you start getting overwhelmed and realise the ease of use of an iPhone. 

I would suggest the following. 

1. Install all the apps you usually use
2. Setup your regular biometrics (iris, fingerprint etc. )
3. As previously said in the post go to the advanced features and look through what your phone can provide. 
4. Use your phone as normal and begin to get used to it

After you've gotten used to your phone then you can get to know more about what it can do.  Depending on how tech savvy your wife is I would let her keep using the phone in the most basic way. 

As for apps - Samsung has an issue of providing both the Google and Samsung related apps on the device. Samsung Email and Gmail are both present on the device, also Photos and Gallery are. I personally use Samsung Email as I believe Samsung done a great job on the software but Gmail would be the popular choice to stick with. 

You have the option to uninstall quite a few of the preinstalled apps on the phone. 

Hope this helps",2018-09-30 11:11:47

I've just received an email from Samsung informing me that my Note 8 was successfully traded in.  It took about 17 days or 13 business days (however you want to look at it) to receive that email.  Samsung received my Note 8 on September the 11th, and then I received the email that informed me of the success of my trade-in on the morning of September the 28th.

I was worried that Samsung wasn't going to accept the trade-in of my Note 8 due to a 3 millimeter scratch near the charging port.  I'm just glad it's all over.    ",2018-09-30 11:42:43

25,"Sounds like me. I had about over 10,000 points, went to buy a gift card and noticed I couldn’t purchase them with points anymore. I looked at it as one less barrier in my way from making the switch as Samsung Pay really kept me using Galaxy. I went back to iPhone. ",2018-09-30 13:46:10
26,"It’s a pity because Samsung Pay is SO much more convenient than all the other mobile wallets. I was getting double rewards having my credit card linked up. It was fun while it lasted, I definitely got over like a fat rat. I have no need for a coupon code on VR gear or a speaker system, they can keep it. ",2018-09-30 14:00:31
27,"I used all iPhones from 5 to 6s series along with a budget android counterpart. until then, it really felt great. Then came the 7 with unnecessary omissions and practically nothing new to offer but still a premium price. I shifted to the nexus 6p and then the google pixel og, followed by my current note 8. Its safe to say i have used both operating systems extensively. Apple tries to unnecessarily impose their own ecosystem and paralyze the client into using them. If you have an iPhone, you have a phone which can do some extra things, you're still gonna have to be in their ecosystem to make the most out of it. If you have an android, you can do so many amazing things and so many trivial things which u cannot on an iPhone. And then, the note phones are basically a mini computer in your pocket. Majority of the android phones don't try to restrict and thats were the difference lies. If you are an iphone user, for many people they're all into it with iphone for phone related activity, the apple watch, the macbook and so on and this was working well but now they're just exploiting out of it. Many people are so used to this ecosystem that they cannot change even if they want to. I have seen, like i said before, so many iphone users wanting to switch to note 9. But they cant because of apples restrictive and exploiting eco system. And so apple can charge whatever they want and get away with it. 

Consider this, when you buy a note 9, you get the best android flagship out right now which has a base storage of 128gb, which can be expanded to 256 or 512. Apple says, they removed the headphone jack to make more space, Samsung made the note 9 with a headphone jack and actually increasing the battery significantly, its like they're the only company showing a middle finger to whatever apple is doing and following their own thoughts. 

Anyway, back to the point you buy a note 9 base model, not only do you still get a headphone jack, you also get an above average akd tuned earphones to go along with it. And not to mention your brick is fast charging. 

With the iPhone, not only did they remove the jack, they even removed the DONGLE from their box. And now they're capitalising on that opportunity to sell it at a high price on their website or earn money through license. And if you want fast charging? It does not come out of the box. This is mad, this is 2018, and you have to pay 50-100 bucks extra just to get fast charging in a 1000$ phone? 

Then theres the software, super restrictive, basic customisation is lacking. Cant do so many things that a standard android can, forget the note 9 which is basically a powerhouse. I can go on and on but people who want to buy iPhones will buy it.
I wished that people had the guts to just abandon the iPhones for a year or to so that smug apple comes down from their high horse and comes back to the reality. 

Also, when alot of people say SPEED and processing is the concern, dont spend 1.5k or 1k or even 700$.
Get a one plus or any android phone running vanilla android it meets or beats apple in tests and when you see the price difference, its embarrassing really. ",2018-09-30 14:50:42

&gt; Built-in device detection; USB port can provide up to 2.4 amps of power (does not support Quick Charge; devices equipped with Quick Charge will charge at normal speed)


For fast charging Samsung phones, you need at least QuickCharge 2.0 capable chargers.   

QuickCharge 2.0 is rebranded by Samsung as ""Adaptive Fast Charging"" which is mentioned on the top of your Samsung charger.  

QuickCharge 3.0 and 4.0 chargers will charge the phone at QC 2.0 speeds, so don't waste money on a new QC 4.0 charger just yet. 
QC 2.0 chargers are rare to find, so just get a QC 3.0 charger (first result on Amazon search for ""QuickCharge"").    

Fun fact: There are at least 5 different fast charging standards (with multiple revisions) and manufacturers confuse us even more by often creating their own brand names for the same technology. And the charger link you provided support none of the 5.

117,"Yes, it’s only a business arrangement at the time because Samsung didn’t have CDMA tech in their modems at the time, so payed for liscencing and snapdragons to launch galaxy in the US. They finally have proprietary CDMA in their modem for next year and won’t have to buy Qualcomm chip anymore if they don’t want to. Qualcomm has been making modems for 3 decades whereas Samsung entered modem market only since 2014; and unexpectedly got its baptism through fire when that years Qualcomm modem had an overheating issue which forced Samsung to launch their brand new modem with galaxy devices, and it survived. All I am saying is, to remain in context of the title, if Samsung themselves hold them back from launching their modem in the US to top tier devices, others will lack some confidence in buying them too. Given how late they entered the industry, they deserve every praise for reaching neck to neck with everyone else so quick.

The new iPhone XS uses intels modem and ditched Qualcomm for the first time, who also entered modem market only 4 years ago. nVidia and HiSilicon and MediaTek are all competent and powerful modems too. Qualcomm may still have a slight performance edge, but that gap is closing fast. Samsung is also right behind Qualcomm in the 5G research and contribution to the 3GPP spec and standards, let’s see. Pretty soon we’ll see 5G and IOT capable devices and Exynos will be an equal or superior modem. Samsung’s own millions of appliances will use their own modems for IOT, so it’s a win win.

I've been using Nova Launcher for a couple of years, originally on my Galaxy S6 and now on my S8 and I genuinely forget that Bixby exists until I see another post on Reddit!

I disabled the Bixby button and set Google as my voice assistance, and as I'm using a different launcher I don't accidentally activate the Bixby home screen either.

Just like the OP I understand that Samsung want to include their own software in a device they made, and I believe they should be allowed to do just that. It does surprise me though that people need to use a different launcher to avoid it seeing it.",2018-10-04 07:26:08
200,"I don't get you, you can simply disable bixby button to do nothing, and turn off bixby on homescreen, it would only come back when Samsung Home Experience updates, but that takes like 5 sec to disable, and that post took you more then that. You could also disable it totally with adb so it never comes back if it's bothering you so much.",2018-10-04 07:26:09
201,"&gt; I don't want to have to change a launcher, but that is definitely an option at the moment! I just don't understand Samsung's approach to this.

I think you do understand it; you just don't agree with it.  I don't agree with it either, to be clear, but I think you understand it: it's Samsung doing what any company who wants their customers to adopt their particular flavor of the month/year: they try to force it on consumers and see what sticks.  Sometimes they're more obnoxious or accepting than others.  Apple took 3 iterations of the iPhone to finally admit that customers wanted copy and paste.  Microsoft has tried to jam Bing and Edge down our throats using various methods for years.  And Samsung is using an easily (and accidentally) pressed button to try to force usage of Bixby.  It's the same thing; just a different product and company.

This is Samsung being Samsung.  If you otherwise like their products, just buy [bxActions - Remap Buttons](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamworks.bxactions) and [Package Disabler Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.powermanager.batteryaddon) and call it good.  Yes, you have to spend around $6.50 (total) to get the phone to work the way you want.  No, you shouldn't have to do this.  But once you do, and spend around an hour learning how to disable Bixby, you're done.

Consider it this way: how much time did it take you to write this post?  While I don't doubt it was cathartic, it did take time.  Also consider how much you make in an hour at your job.  Does it exceed $6.50?  Most likely.  So you're going to spend an hour of your time making at least $6.50 to buy the apps, and another hour to learn to use them and get your phone set up the way you want.  Then you're done, and can move on with your life.  Is two hours of your time worth not having to deal with this?  Is the price of coffee and a donut (or two) worth getting rid of this stress you're dealing with?  I'd posit that it is.  :-)

As an aside, consider using [Nova Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher).  No, not because of Bixby; because it's a much better launcher with many nice options.  You don't have to, but I'll bet you'll like it better.  Yes, it's worth the $0.99 upgrade to Prime, but you can try it before you do so don't worry about that.  Also use the Samsung Apps app to download Good Lock and its associated apps.  They're all free and offer a ton of nice functionality options.",2018-10-04 07:59:17
202,"The problem is that you shouldn’t have to turn it off every time SE updates. That’s ridiculous. 

If I turned it off I made that decision for a reason. It should remain disabled until the user changes it. No custom launcher or extra app should be required to turn off such a pointless and intrusive feature, because that is what it is. 

I turned it off plenty more times than I updated SE and that’s what made me give up on Samsung. On iOS I expect something to be shoved down my throat, but that’s not android-style at all, that’s why 99% of all people claim they get an android “freedom of choice”. Samsung just removes that freedom. ",2018-10-04 08:08:59
203,"In short? Is a dark pattern.

Longer version: In user experience design (the design of a product or service from the perspective of usability and accessibility rather than just aesthetics), there's a concept called a ""pattern"". This means a design or style of a particular interface that allows someone to do something. Translated into real world terms, an example would be the way a particular app allows you to type in text, or adjust your volume, or upload a file. On the web, a UX pattern might be how a particular website allows you to login, or the process by which you would add a product to your shopping cart, choose to check out, and then finalize your purchase.

There's another concept, not as commonly discussed: a dark pattern. This is a UX (user experience) decision that is made to serve the purposes of the company and priorities this decision over (and sometimes to the exclusion of) goals or desires of a user. An example of this is a site that requires you to make an account and login before they will allow you to view their content (even when it's free), or that keeps bothering you with pop ups asking you to allow notifications or to sign up for a mailing list.

Sometimes this is just poor design. However, when the company is aware of an intended goal of the user, and interrupts that goal in order to push an alternative desired by the company on the user instead, that is when poor design becomes a dark pattern.

What you are experiencing here is a dark pattern. You want to just use your phone, if you want Google Assistant to be your default virtual assistant. Samsung would rather you use Bixby instead. They are so determined to try to ""help"" you make this decision that they are degrading the user experience in order to accomplish that goal. No, it's not usually considered wise by those of us who designed user experiences. Unfortunately, we are only the ones making the recommendations, not the ones making the decisions. You can thank Samsung corporate product management/ownership for that.

So that's the ""why"". Yes, it's stupid. But it's the way it is, has been, and will be for the foreseeable future. It isn't just Samsung; it is true of most large organizations on the planet.",2018-10-04 08:30:09

To do that, boot up recovery mode by turning the phone completely off, then pressing **Volume up** + **Bixby** + **Power**, until the Samsung boot screen comes up. Release the keys, and when the Android Recovery pops up (you'll know it's the one when you get the message **""Downloading Update""** or similar.) This is not an actual update, and after the screen is gone, Android Recovery will show.

Qi quick charge relies on higher voltage to do its job. If the phone believes that the pad, cable, or power brick isn't capable, it won't quick charge.

As for the memory, the available RAM seems about right. On an android phone, the amount of RAM available can be small, as the OS will use as much of it as possible for cache. The phone will adjust as needed, without a slowdown. The browsers that come by default are chrome and maybe the Samsung browser, which I actually like.

Now, the earbuds sounds amazing, yes amazing, is like 75% of the akg's volume,bass is enough, mids and highs sounds good and can cause ear problems if you go all the way, now,thanks to the noise cancellation the volume don't need to be that high. 

Today i used the iconx to a level never expected, since I'm using it longer than before i put a giant playlist on the iconx memory, the battery lasted from 10:15 am till 4:45 with 5% remaining of battery, according to Samsung 4 to 5 hours is estimated time it should lasted if the music is onboard, if you talk and stream music from the phone the iconx normally last like 3.5 to 4 hours unstop.

The case provides another full charge, and charges pretty fast, use usb-c so since you have an N8 is one less cable to worry about.

Love the controls can be used in both sides, you can change the volume, songs, play list, voice control etc in any of the earbuds. 

The water proofing is top notch.

Again about the noise cancellation, is smazing, you can ride the trains or been anywhere and theres no ambient noise that can get to your ear, you're completely isolated from the world. Oh but don't worry, the iconx have some kind of microphone that can be activated and set for higher or lower settings  that allows you to listen yours surrounding, even have a voice boost so it recognizes and amplifies human voices. 

Portability is great, you can jump, twist your hear like the exorcist and the iconx will stay put and sounding great.

What i hate ? Would love a 8+ hours battery life.

If i would buy it again ?  Hell yeah.  I love the low profile and giant sound this things have, the onboard memory is a more than welcome feat and a life saver when your phone battery is dying.

I understand that the price of the device are going tru the sky and resale value is going down fast but that's what you have when the innovations are so high and so fast like we get 9n android, in the apple side you can pile those and a bit chunk of ppl would have a hard time telling you witch iphone is, because they look inside and outside the same, performance improvements are marginal, and most user still debating that apple is the one bringing the new things to the market. 

Around 8 months ago i was talking to my friend and he told me how angry he was on android with so many customizations that was hard for him to keep it up (he was an apple user b4) i told him that was good because he can get a phone tailored to his need, after defending why apple charged him 60$ for a fast charger that has been free for years and still faster on samsung he told me ""i need no options"" i just told him this: if you father is a buss driver why are you're studing in college ? Why ? because you love your father but you don't need to be a copy of him, you wanna do your own stuff.  That's called options.

I tend to keep my phones long time, i tend to don't  buy at regular price, so when i sell my devices the resale value doesn't affect me that much. I paid like 535ish for my note 8 (the truth was free) in lunch day in tmobile, so if i hold it for one more year and sell it in 400ish is ok with me. If not then i keep it just like i did with my note 4 that still in my drawer just in case of emergency, or just pass it to my daughter (she need an upgrade fast, she have a 70$ samsung for the last 2 years, prior was a 40$ nokia that she loved it till i left it in the roof of the car then took off)

Few weeks ago i was making the case here in reddit about how stupid the prices were going and that i may make the jump for a popcophone F1 if my n8 fail, the popcophone is laking a lot if features that my phone has,  but is time to stand up and start patronizing new players that give us a better value for our hard earned money. now please explain me how can you do that in the apple side with apple controlling 100% of the sale, resale, os, production, repair, repair parts, even the apps that you can use ? Is a dictatorship system for their users, but if that make them happy is ok with me, i prefer functionality over look, but millions think otherwise,   is called options and i love to have mine as well.

33,"I got a galaxy book 12 for school that stopped powering consistently from what turned out to be a motherboard issue.  Despite being just out of warranty, Samsung covered the parts and labor to have the device serviced by Creative Vision Electronics.

CVE replaced the motherboard and data link, and ran QA diagnostics indicating the device was in complete working order on a service receipt.

Then I got that mess when I powered it on for the first time since receiving it 2 days ago, and it's only gotten worse.

Samsung phone support was on holiday until today.
Samsung online told me to contact CVE, which has not actually been available on calling, nor returned calls from leaving information.
UPS does not deal directly with the receiver in these matters.

I believe Samsung Care initiated a UPS claim today, but I've never been involved in this process before and don't know how the investigation works, or how they followup based on the findings.

63,"No iMessage equivalent on Android, and Apple's customer service is second to none. That said, iMessage is becoming more of a legacy platform these days. It looks fancy but that was a few years before so many other options became available. Younger people don't do much with iMessage as of late. It is more of a gimmick than a killer feature.

As for Apple, the phones they sell are solid and they support updates for at least four years. The iPhone resale values are much better. The CPU is faster, sound from the speakers is better, and support for bluetooth headphones is better. Also, you can't beat the ecosystem. Everything really does work well together. Truth is, you won't be sorry with the switch to an iPhone. It is a terrific platform.

 If you want to stay with Android though, you won't be able to beat Samsung. I prefer Android for its customizability, expandable memory, and tons of options for available devices. Updates are terrific with Samsung as of late, and I love my s9+ for many reasons. 

Phones these days are so similar for the average user. If you just want something that works and don't want to spend 1000 to 1200 dollars on a phone, and if you've already spent money on apps from the Play Store, stick with Samsung. You can find an s9+ for about 600 dollars these days. That's about half what you'd pay for an equivalent model iPhone, and the differences aren't that much of a better value.

106,"One of my favorite but simple things is when you bring down the control panel and tap on the words instead of the icon it opens a mini menu right there in the control panel. A long press will take you to the full page.

 Most of the edge features are actual very useful it's just a matter of getting in the habit of using them. I recommend playing around with the various apps for it. 

Bixby is good as well,  but I recommend disabling the Bixby home button.  As accidental presses happen often,  but you will still have long press or  voice commands to access Bixby voice. Which works beautifully with other Samsung or smartthings devices. The smartthings hub is also extremely useful especially if you use Samsung accessories and devices.

144,"How many times do people have to tell to people like you that it's stupid to do Google Play versions.

For starters, Google has their own beef with the companies that won't allow them to simply port the Pixel experience on their devices (with the major fear of losing their Pixel juices). And what I mean by this is that yeah, you can indeed build a close to stock experience device even with higher end hardware. But when your name is Samsung or LG, it ain't that easy behind the curtains.

Secondly, the amount of people who really want a completely dead stock experience is tiny. Yeah, it feels like everybody actually wants stock android when you're on a community where mostly these people find their way here/there.

Thirdly, people for some odd reason behave like Samsung just starts really late to build the OS and they just hold it for no reason. It takes a ton of time building these &amp; making sure they are stable. Not to mention, you aren't actually gaining that much by going to the next OS when security patches exist. Literally a handful of Pie's features were already baked within Samsung Experience 9.0 which released quite a while ago. This is just a ""hurr durr, I want moar"" mentality going to the next level thinking you're losing out ""big time"".

Now that Google has developed Project Treble, it makes it easier to separate Android code from OEM specific code, so the process has improved.

194,"An awesome reason why Samsung Pay is WAAAAAAYYY better than all other forms of mobile payments: 

Samsung works on 90% of credit card readers because they use NFC in conjunction with MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission), which they legally own and no other phone company can use. MST emits a magnetic signal that simulates the magnetic strip found on the back of a credit or debit card, which is why Samsung Pay is superior. All other phones only use NFC, which only work on the new credit card readers that have NFC readers installed.

I love when I get to educate cashiers on this. Especially when they tell me ""We don't take Apple Pay"". Their reactions are the best when they realize how very wrong they were. 

I love Samsung Pay ‚ù§

244,"I loved my s7 edge. It ended up becoming a bit laggy, but my real issue was with the fingerprint reader. My fingerprints are a bit less defined, through years of labor, I suppose, so the phone would often have trouble reading my prints. The screen was fantastic though, and the battery was stellar. 32GB of storage was way too small, in my opinion, and Samsung eventually pulled support for the ADB ability to merge the internal memory with an sd card, which meant that updates would cause apps to crawl back into internal memory and then needed to be moved back to the sd card. The camera on the s7 edge just seemed super fast and clear. Saying cheese to snap a photo was fun, too.

I have an s9 plus now, and I miss the hardware buttons a lot, but the fingerprint reader is much better for me, and the 64GB internal storage is nice. I use an sd card for photos and such. The camera is better at low light pictures, but the s7 edge seemed faster at taking shots. I feel the s9 plus is the s7 edge with improvements all around, and compared with the iPhone 8 plus, it is much lighter. The 8 plus was my other option when looking at the s9 plus, at the time. I'm not a notch fan, and I like to customize the phone.

252,"Haha, I just got off the chat support with Samsung Chat here: [https://www.samsung.com/us/support/contact/](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/contact/) they were pretty much useless and suggested that I revert back to Windows 8.1 So, after a while night of a whole TON of trial and errors (reformatted over 30x last night), I've been able to isolate the issue.

I myself have the  NP880Z5E, but our models are similar enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

Optional step: install SSD, so worth it, my boot up is \~20sec now.

# Steps:

1. Reformat using Win10 boot from disk
2. Check windows update, restart if prompted

 

Step 3&amp;4: Install [Display Driver Uninstaller](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html) (might be better than uninstalling manually because removes all setup files)

**OR**: Run: devmgmt.**msc &gt;** Display adapters &gt; Uninstall

3. Uninstall device:  Intel HD 4000,  Delete driver software.  (no need to reset)

4. Uninstall device: AMD Radeon HD 8600/8700m

Note: after reading 40+ forums and threads online, I've been told to do 3 and 4 IN THAT ORDER

&amp;#x200B;

5.  Now Reset \[**Create Restore Point 2**: Uninstalled Display Drivers\] 

6. Install Microsoft Basic Display Adapter (instead of Intel HD 4000)

&gt;Right-click Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000  
&gt;  
&gt;Driver &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse Manually &gt; Let me pick   
&gt;  
&gt;\[**Create Restore Point**\] 

7. Install  [Samsung Easy Settings](https://drivers.softpedia.com/get/Other-DRIVERS-TOOLS/Samsung/Samsung-NP300E5C-Notebook-Easy-Settings-Software-1114-for-Windows-7.shtml) (1.1.1.4 seems to be the last update; no need to run on compatibility mode)

8.  Windows &gt; Display Settings: uncheck ""Change brightness automatically when lighting changes"" box 

9.  Test brightness using f2/f3 function keys

10. Create another Restore Point! So you don't need to do the drama I did!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

# Do NOTTTTT Install latest [AMD Radeon HD 8600/8700m drivers](https://www.amd.com/en/support/graphics/amd-radeon-hd/amd-radeon-hd-8000m-series/amd-radeon-hd-8690m-series-gpu)

* (Windows may have automatically installed 17.1.1 Radeon, which should also work) 

Also, do NOTTTTTTT install Intel‚Äôs HD 4000 drivers, even if the latest ones are here: [https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/81499/Intel-HD-Graphics-4000](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/81499/Intel-HD-Graphics-4000)

Installing Intel‚Äôs Drivers render the Fn f2 &amp; f3 brightness buttons useless for the Ativ 8 + Win10.

273,"I'm much more concerned about the merchant having the actual card number than the walkby scenario. As I said, the main value in Samsung Pay is that the merchant gets an issuer token that can (and does) change whenever the issuer wants, and which cannot be used for CNP fraud instead of the PAN. 
I'm a PCI QSA (P2PE) and PA-QSA (P2PE), as well as a VISA PIN SA - I'm pretty well versed on payment card security :).
As to phone fumbling, that's what a phone case is for - and I usually pay using my Galaxy S3 Frontier watch, which has Samsung Pay with MTS built-in. No risk of fumbling anything, and my payment card stays safe and out of sight in my wallet. ",2019-01-07 09:24:57
274,"There's always a terminal. Gas stations have mostly implemented NFC as they do the mandated update to current PTS terminals as the exception that allowed them to use old terminals expires in October 2020. NFC is part of current EMV requirements, so all chip supporting terminals will support it eventually as well.
The waitress is one of the annoying US-only scenarios that still exist. I only use Amex cards in that scenario, as they are a) not NFC enabled, b) have no set credit limit and c) Amex is issuer, acquirer and network, and is generally better at noticing unusual activity. Plus, let's not forget that Samsung Pay let's me know everytime one of my registered cards is used anywhere, so I can take immediate action no matter where I am.
I travel a lot internationally for work as well, it's a lot more reassuring to know that I don't have to worry about my PANs, PINs or actual cards getting stolen - and I've used Samsung Pay around the world.
In fact, the only times it hasn't worked, those are the times that I pay in cash, since it is an indication that the system the merchant is using is doing something wrong, and probably wouldn't pass PA-DSS validation. That is a huge red flag for me, personally. ",2019-01-07 11:52:53

I know for a 100% fact that from Android 8, including the international S7 and upwards on XEU/BTU firmware, WiFi and VoLTE is included for all networks, in the software

Samsung decided to include all carrier/network support for VoLTE and WiFi calling on BTU/XEU - which can be flashed if the phone is network unlocked 

Have 2 S7's both on different networks and can swap Sims between phones and both have WiFi and VoLTE available as well as my S9.

My tests only go as far as the XEU/BTU firmware which can be flashed if the phone is network unlocked.

Where's your S8 originally from? Grab a Three PAYG sim, put it in and see if you get VoLTE calls.

To try out WiFi calls, let the SIM in the phone for a few minutes, make a call to it then put the phone on flight mode and turn WiFi on.

Make sure the WiFi calling setting is turned on first. You should get the WiFi call symbol at the top",2019-01-07 14:55:37

300,"Thank you for this.

I find this part doesn't make a whole lot of sense though (nothing against you, just their policy doesn't make sense if this is true):

""samsung cant assure condition of device and assure no damage transferred in the process""

Do you mean Samsung can't be assured? Because why would any damage occur just because the phone transferred from one person's hands to another? I mean they only cover manufacturer defects anyways (not a cracked screen or whatever), so who owns the phone is irrelevant. Or do you mean the person who buys it used can't be assured of the device's condition or any damage? Again, warranty only covers manufacturer defects in the warranty period, so why would it matter?

Anyhow, how do they even know you are the original purchaser? Is it by receipt? So if you buy used and get the receipt from the seller, or give the phone as a gift with the receipt, wouldn't that be enough to claim warranty if needed?



That's so strange that Samsung ""can't assure condition of the device"" while Apple doesn't care if you're the 10th owner, as long as it's under warranty they'll fix it..... As a Samsung user that's pretty disappointing

Iphones are decent in all catagories but android is just far superior, you make the phone look like you want and change how it functions entirly (plus you could easily get any app or song for free without breaking warrenty) 

I cant get myself to get any apple products because each one just becomes more and more of a cashgrab with each product, and theu would only really be worth the price and a 40-50% discount

Also apple and innovation dont really gp together, especially not the design up untill rhe 6 and x it was the same peice of crap phone design (not to mention blatently leaving in a bend gate to cut production costs), but the most innovative design was the xaomi mi mix until the, galaxy until the Find X (which might i add was an absolutly perfect way to hid the front facing components",2018-07-02 00:54:52

I just always assumed it was the OS and maybe a display or two on models since Android models rock different display properties. 

(Last iPhone I had was a 5 and switched back to Android after due to iTunes never working right, everything wanting to sync bothered me as I try to keep my phone a brick as much as possible and hate developers butting in, and lack of home screen customization. There was also a case where I lost all my music, photos, and contacts when my phone did an auto update and over the phone I was snobbly told to back up and that apple products work better together WHEN why is something that is supposed to INSTALL something doing the exact opposite of that by DELETING files... in apps that are apple certified so it's not like a third party mishap. 

Haven't gone back to apple since that one and have had an s5 and 3 s7's after so idk the full details but some of the features now are either niche, lack proper support, or is pushed in models for consumer feedback.

65,65,"Welcome to the best decision you've made in a while ;)

Seriously though.  I had the first iPhone all the way through (each phone in between) to the iPhone 5.  Had 3 iPads.  And 4 iPods from the original metal spinning hard drive to the later model touch sreens etc.  And I dabbled in iOS developing 3 apps that used to be on the app store (made a few hundred on em).

Then I switched to Galaxy/Android one day after having a few hours to toy around on a friend's

I've now gone from every Galaxy from that point to the Note 3, 4, 5, 7, 7 (lol), and now the 8.

Since then I have switched my parents from iPhones and iPads to Galaxys and Samsung tablets.  My wife too although she was just on an old LG something which was android so she doesn't count haha.

Why am I spouting off about ALL of that?

1) Shows I am not just an android fan boy, I had plenty of exposure to apple garbage.  Honestly I STILL believe apple was better up until around the iPhone 5 when Samsung started flying past them.

2) Shows even the excuse ""But I don't need all that extra shit, I am a simple person and prefer the training wheels style of apple"" is still not true as my parents are old and retired and absolutely love their new Android overlords and are now on their 4th or 5th phones.

3) Despite the Note 7 fuck up, I'm still here and loyal and honestly could not be happier with my current phone, and my past ones (even that Note 7 was bad ass).  Love my wife's new phone.  And we have my son on an LG G6 which is nice too.

P.S. Your favorite thing about Android will be watching Apple commercials when they announce 'new' features and you giggle as we've had that for YEARS now.

P.P.S. If you're looking for those ""must have"" apps I won't go off on an extensive list but Nova Launcher is a must and is worth the money for Pro.

90,90,"I work in retail selling TVs, computers, cameras, etc. There's MUCH more to what makes a TV other than the screen size and resolution. 

The most basic, other than resolution, would be the panel type. More expensive panels have better colour reproduction, better viewing angles, and tend to be held to a higher quality control standard so tend to last longer. At the highest end of these panels currently available to consumers would be Samsung's QLED, and LG/Sony's OLED. OLED has the advantage of getting perfect blacks as each LED generates it's own light, eliminating the need of a backlight, and allowing OLEDs to be the most colour accurate panels. However, QLED is brighter, so it works better in a brighter room, and it doesn't have the risk of burn-in like OLEDs have.

Then there's what type of backlighting the TV uses. For simplicity I'll keep it to edge lighting, and full array lighting. Edge lighting is cheaper, but you get the drawbacks of worse image and colour quality, and you can notice dropoffs in brightness on certain parts of the screen. Full array lighting has LEDs spread all behind the panel for a more uniform and consistent backlight.

High Dynamic Range (HDR) is a feature that has become more common on TVs in the past few years. [Linus over here can explain it better than I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wthhc1s0Pig). 

Next is 4K upscaling. Almost no cable signal does 4K, unless you have a fiber optic TV box. So to get your standard cable signal filling up the full 4K screen, the TV has to upscale the signal, which basically means it has to generate extra pixels that weren't originally there. Generally, the more expensive the TV, the better the upscaling is. Right now Sony seems to have the best upscaling chips. Of course, you can get 4k content from online sources, or from a 4K Blu-Ray player with 4K disc though.

Other than that, as you pay more, Smart TV functionalities tend to be better and more snappy, speakers get better, etc. 

The main reason I would rather buy a TV from the big guys (Samsung, Sony, LG), rather than the small guys (Hisense, RCA, etc.) is overall quality and support. You will experience MUCH better support from the bigger companies, not only in customer service, but also in setting up third party devices such as universal remotes, etc. The big guys tend to have more authorized service centers also, where as you're pretty much out of luck with the small guys.",2018-07-03 13:58:33

2. I carefully went through the Terms and Conditions before sending my phone in, making sure it met each one. Nowhere is liquid or water damage listed in the T&amp;C. 
3. Samsung had the phone for over 4 months before discovering any damage. It sounds like the damage occurred while in Samsung's care, as yours did. 

I initialized a dispute with my credit card company very soon after the charge was made. I have contacted Samsung 7 times via phone and email, and they have been incredibly unhelpful.  The first representative said he couldn't find any evidence of liquid damage, which he thought was odd, nor could he find anything in the T&amp;C about liquid damage. They are still charging me, though. This post encouraged me to contact the BBB, which I have just done.

A damn dedicated physical button in an inconvenient place for a single app/tool that a meaningful portion of owners will never use. Every button is an extra inlet for potential water damage on a phone that's supposed to be pretty strongly water resistant.

Also, I am completely uninformed about Bixby in particular, but I have a reluctance and paranoia about 'digital assistants' and their potential for breaching my privacy in a number of ways. So Bixby was a no-go for me right off the bat.

ALSO, I am a boring middle age man stuck in his ways. I've used smartphones since before Android - the old Samsung Windows Mobile phones 10+ years ago. They were horrible, of course. But I've had a way of doing things since Android 3 or so that I just haven't really changed. My stuff is setup as much like my old configs as possible. I don't want shiny new stuff. I want my old stuff, only faster and better. Bixby has no place in that.

Was a tad bit slipper when I was having my hands slightly wet from transpiration, decided to get a case before the beautiful glass was going to break one day. Was this close to getting the basic Samsung silicone black cover, didn't like the way it looked and the way it felt in the pocket, I then gave both the led cover (big fan in the past) case a view and then the clear view cover, said I wanted something different.

I instantly wanted to get the alcantara one until I remembered it ruins itself once it touches water. I then instantly bought the protective standing cover. Do not regret it one bit even tho it looks a bit weird on the back. The phone altho heavier, is easier to hold in your hand, the button pressing feels really easy compared to the naked phone, the stand is a huge huge plus and the way the back is made, if I have money or papers in my pocket, I don't risk pulling it all out once I grab my phone. The only actual minus is the extra weight, the phone now easily passed the 200g mark and the physical size increased. One think I'm a huge fan of however, is the fact that I know how sensitive OLED panels can be to direct sunlight, this case has big protruding lips over the top and bottom of the phone. I can easily put the phone on my table laying screen side down without an issue and if somebody calls or messages me, the edge lighting lights the table, I can easily tell basic whatsapp messages or facebook messages apart from actual sms texts.

183,183,"Software wise, yes. If the phone starts up to this screen, the only thing you can do is flash a new firmware to the phone.

Go and download [Samsung Smart Switch](https://www.samsung.com/us/smart-switch/). In Smart Switch you have an option named ""Emergency Firmware Recovery"" (or something among these words). Its' for such situations.

When you'll click it, it will ask for your phone device number (the one on your phone's screen named ""Product Name"" after the double dots) and for a serial number which is written both on the back of the phone (down in the little text area) and on the box of the phone either under ""S/N"" or Serial Number.

Once you write these values, it will begin downloading a new firmware for the phone (the latest one). You'll eventually be prompted to connect the device to the PC. AFter connecting it, wait for at least 1 minute so that you don't get your phone randomly disconnected by Windows. After the one minute, press continue or start, it will start writing the new firmware to the phone.

After the process ends, the phone will be good as new. It will start normally and you'll have to write in a google account and a Samsung account. You'll be able of using your phone normally afterwards. Hope I helped!",2018-07-06 02:06:30

I ordered from Amazon since its cheaper.

I use the Neo Hybrid case as my 'day-to-day' case where the phone is always in my pocket.  

I use the Wallet S case when I go traveling since the fold over cover provides a better grip when taking lots of photos (or having strangers take photos with your phone) and the cover also protects the screen when throwing the phone in my backpack going through airport security etc..  However, you could use the Wallet case as a day-to-day case as well.

The other thing I strongly recommend buying for the Samsung S9+, Google Pixel 2XL or any large size phone is a Phone Loop from [https://phoneloops.com/](https://phoneloops.com/).

* Jumped from iPhone to Android, photos and contacts backed up with Google and email stil syncs with email apps. 
* Samsung Pay is amazing and the best mobile payment EVER. 
* Loaded with features
* Speakers with DOLBY Atmos are loud and crisp, also with headphones! EQ and custom sound profile are great to have
* Customizable
* Software gets better, homescreen looks modern and also on par with some launchers
* Capable device with RAM management and storage that never runs out (especially with SD Card) 
* Battery is okay, lasts the whole day with battery saver on and stuff like Background Network off and AOD off. 
If you can get it discounted, it is absolutely worth it! Hope you make a great decision and love your phone OP.  Love the S9 Plus!

244,244,"This phone is marvelous ~

Simply put, the display is incredible. Watching videos or scrolling through Instagram is very enjoyable and it gets hard to go back to other displays (we get spoiled :p)
The camera is excellent too and if you're not a huge camera savvy, it will suit all your needs just fine and keep you going for a long time.
The audio experience is really great too, plugged in or not. I underestimated having dual speakers as a feature but I end up using Dolby Atmos the most. Seriously, it's just fun to be able to play music in the house with your own phone speaker. Also, the AKG bundled earphones are pretty great too. Headphone jack is a plus.
S9 is surprisingly fast. I've had previous samsung phones and they always felt kind of slow, but this one doesnt lag and even after 4 months it performs the same as it did when I first got it.
Battery isnt its best feature but it comfortably gets me through 1 day and can last to 2 with some conservative usage.
The software isnt as annoying and Android 8.0 adds a bonus too. Just be advised that software updates for Samsung phones always take 5 billion years so just keep that in mind.

So 330mbps is the max transfer rate you can do with the samsung cable that comes with the phone.  It is piece of junk as a usb cable.  ,2018-07-08 23:16:51

253,253,"Ok, I will try to provide some feedback for you. I actually have two pairs of level u headphones. I have the pros and a pair with anc.  I have two pairs because I don't always charge them everyday and when one dies I just swap them out for the other pair and charge the dead ones in my car.  I'm lucky enough to be in a semi construction job where I can wear these all day.  
I listen to music often but audio books are what I listen to the most. So on to the good news.
Work time..yes you will get 8 hrs out of these easily. I can make it a full day with music or books but most time I am starting and stopping often or taking calls..my working partner bought some after trying mine and loves them also. 
Now for the anc. I would say that it is decent. I think the main advantage is that they are ear buds and have a passive ability to block sound as it is so the anc doesn't have to be spectacular. I have been in loud server rooms for a whole day and don't know how I would have lived without the anc. It really helps but if you're looking for Bose quiet comfort level of anc it's not going to happen..those things are crazy good. As far as battery life. It's going to take a hit with anc on..if I had to guess because I haven't run anc all day for a while, I would say about 6 hours maybe a bit more. The good news is that these things charge very fast..you can plug them in for 15-20 min and get 1.5 hrs. 
Sound wise..I think they are good.. decently loud although I don't think any wireless headphones are loud enough. You do have access to Samsungs uhq sound if your using a newer Galaxy and yes it makes quite the difference. The sound is much more crisp.  Bass wise they are good..not crazy bass but I think they are just fine..
Comfort and build..I think they are very comfortable. I know not a lot of people like around the neck stuff but these are just fine..light weight and the build quality is the best out of the two. 
With pricing the way it has dropped lately I don't think you can go wrong with these..I was looking into the new around the neck headphones from Samsung but I don't think they support uhq or any other high def sound so that's a no go for me..
I purchased my standard pros at Sam's club for a good price and ordered the anc from Samsung. At the time they were fairly new so they were still pricy..
I hope this has helped you. I have had these for a while and the last thing I will say is that they are fairly durable. I am a pretty careful person with electronics but even still they are pretty strong.
Good luck .",2018-07-09 00:50:29

 If you ever do have to ship. Take pics of phone current condition and todays newspaper with date on it. Make sure newspaper is in the background. Bonus with pics next to shipping material. That way you can't get fucked over.

293,293,"I had helped my friend switch from an iPhone 7 with Smart Switch and worked very well. It can't move everything (like certain messaging apps) but this works easily. It'll even match up existing apps and ask if you want to install corresponding Android versions. The only annoying part is that during the ""search"" process, the slightest movement of the cable will cancel it. For things that don't come over, check to see if the app has a backup cloud feature.

Most of the big apps are there and corresponding desktop services/apps are also there. Personally, I would look to moving things out of iCloud to allow other apps access to your stored data for the most flexibility. The biggest change could be Google Photos if you're not using it already. Moving files from iCloud to anything else is fairly trivial.

Samsung also has a backup service as well which you can choose to use or not. I think their backup services are decent. Pickup a MicroSD card for external photo storage. It'll free up app space on your phone. Samsung also likes to duplicate apps so you can choose to try others before deciding (like text messaging, contacts, gallery, etc) and then disable/hide the ones you don't want to use.

304,304,"True.  When I updated my iPhone, suddenly I had only 25% of my original battery life.  I learned later, that they changed the way the radios were handled in low-power mode, and since I live in a zero-to-1 bar area, my battery life dropped to 2-3 hours (was getting 8-9 hours before, advertised for much, much more) a day before shutdown.  I've noticed this effect with different phones, manufacturers, and oses.

Like others have said, if it's still under warranty, take it in and let the shop have a look at it.

Was it always crap, or did it die gradually (or even suddenly)?

So many things can cause drain.  If you have great battery life in safe mode, then it's an app causing the issue.  If you prove it isn't an app to Samsung, then you can get a free repair, or in extreme cases, a replacement.",2018-07-10 22:28:30

Without video proof, even the 30 to 90 claim is beyond anything possible, especially with qualcomm quick charging 2.0 or samsung fast charging 1.0. I'm sorry. I've had quite a lot of phones, none from Samsung (even S6 which had a tiny battery) would charge THAT fast. The fastest charging phone I ever owned was this A5 2017. It takes a literal 1 hour and about 5-10 minutes to go from dead to 100&amp;#37;.",2018-07-11 04:57:46

315,315,"TL;DR: Huge explanation bellow about charging these phones. If you aren't in the mood to read, just watch the video linked bellow. It's showing pretty much everything I was saying up. Have a great day!

That's the case with most Samsung phones for a while now. My S9+ also charges quite a significant bit if plugged in the wall for like 15-30 minutes. Only requirement is that I turn off wifi/data when doing so and I get about 40&amp;#37; in 30 minutes. After that it charges slower and when I reach 90&amp;#37; it takes a full 20-30 minutes to hit 100. Which is normal behaviour. It acts this way to preserve the life of the battery.

Now. Pure proof of what I said earlier is, first of all, the fact that battery technology works this way. If you will start using the other 15&amp;#37; percent of the battery til' you hit 0&amp;#37;, you'll realise that the 15&amp;#37; left is lasting longer than as much as 30&amp;#37; of your normal usage. My old S6 once lasted me around 13 minutes on 1&amp;#37;. I wanted to fully drain it and recharge it. And the last 1&amp;#37; lasted more than about 10&amp;#37; did. There are talks about these phenomenons on the internet. Won't bother trying to find them.

My analogy for you (and I'm ending on this note) is the fact that all current Samsung phones that support fast charging, have the same exact componentry for charging. My S9 does not charger any faster or slower than your A8 or my A5 or even J series phones that support fast charging. The power brick delivers 10W in fast charging mode. Maybe my S9 will be 1-2&amp;#37; more efficient in handling that, but not enough for it to be noticeable in the long run. You'll maybe save 30 minutes of charging per year due to that efficiency increase.

[Here's a youtube video from a Hindi youtuber showing that in fact, it takes both the A8 and A8+ a normal amount of time to go from 0&amp;#37; to 100&amp;#37;.](https://youtu.be/KEIGhb6w4qg?t=88)

And judging by the increases seen here, it's physically impossible for your A8 to reach 90&amp;#37; from 30&amp;#37; in just 20-30 minutes, let alone 15-20.

Unless you had your phone repaired and you got a smaller battery placed in your phone (Something like 1500mA), you're either not aware of how long it actually takes to charge (because you're usually doing something else than spending time to check your phone religiously) or you're simply oblivious and pretty much assuming everything rather than basing off actual numbers.

And with that I'm ending my thesis here. I have owned many samsung phones both before fast charging was a thing and after and I have noticed always how long it took to charge a phone. A note 4 for example, does indeed charge slower compared to something like an S7 while an S7 charges barely any slower compared to an S9. Why? The charging technology inside the phone has improved through time quite a bit. We moved most of the charging components into chargers (hence they get so hot when charging a phone), and now the phone simply has to do minimal work. The same charger that shipped with the Galaxy Note 4 (first official fast charging Samsung device) has identical hardware on the inside with any samsung adaptive fast charger sold today. Identical. It can charge both Quick Charge 2.0 devices &amp; Fast Charge 1.0 devices just well.

And simply basing off the fact that the charger itself is identical, I can simply say our phones charge the same, exact same actually efficiency being slightly different from one phone to another but newer gen devices such as the A8 and S9 having virtually the same capability.",2018-07-11 07:48:07

If you go under Settings-&gt; Data-&gt; Data Usage you should be able to see a toggle for Data Saver.

418,418,"I already owned the Westones, so that part of the purchase was not needed.

To get customs, you pay an audiologist to make a silicone mold, which isn't expensive.  It feels funny, admittedly :) .

Those molds of your inner and outer ears are sent to the vendor who will craft them into custom fitted IEMS for you.  In many cases, those can be used as plug-in replacements for the generic inner ear molds with an existing IEM - such as the AKG model included with the Samsung.  You might have to specify the IEM model, potentially.

In my case, I used InEarz because they agreed to reuse my Westone hardware (i.e., they literally broke the shells open to get at their components), then create custom IEMs as single units for each ear, made to my specs (i.e., shorter inner ear depth, softer canal material, custom outer shell colours, 2-prong cable attachment type, Westone audio hardware).

I don't know if InEarz is still adapting existing IEMs to custom IEMs or if they only sell their own audio hardware (which includes the custom fit), but here's their process and links to prices, if curious:

https://www.inearz.com/how-to-order/

Note 8 has a 3300 mah battery, 6 GB of RAM. 6.3"" screen, dual 12 MP camera (8 MP on the front), 64 GB internal storage, 256 GB SD card slot, and the S Pen (which keep in mind isn't for everyone)
S9 has 3000 MAH battery, 4 GB of RAM, 5.8"" screen, single 12 MP camera with that lense that opens and closes (8 on the front), 64 GB internal and a 400 GB SD card slot.
So, unless the size of the phone and the SD card slot are important to you, then there you go.
Now, i actually sell these things on a daily basis, and i opted for the S9+ for my personal phone.

The S9+, IMO, surpasses the note 8 just barely.
It has everything the s9 has, but it separates itself with the 3500 mah battery, 6 GB of RAM and a 6.2"" display and that dual camera on the back which IMO beats the Note 8.

I think the S9 and the S8 are very similar. I wouldn't get another S7, if I were you. I don't even know if you can brand new ones from stores anymore. 

If you're looking for something more budget friendly and if you want a flat screen instead of the curved screen, the new A8 looks pretty slick. I work in a cell phone store and the A8 is outselling the S series right now. For every S8 or S9 we sell, we sell at least two A8's. Most people picking the A8 are coming from Samaung S5, S6, and LG G4 and G5.  Most S7 users are picking the S9, though.

iOS is simple which is preferred by many and Android's limitless potentials are also loved by many. On top of the OS difference, Samsung has even more features than standard Android.

Its very unlikely that samsung will repair it and if u put it into a shop you'll be charged at least 200 as they don't repair usb slots without doing a complete screen change. If your feeling up to it I'd suggest just changing the USB yourself and the battery while your at it. It's a bit tricky but if I can do it then anyone can.,2018-08-02 04:25:07

Second, no, 8.1 is not possible. Even Samsungs flagships are on 8.0.0. Why? Because 8.1 was mostly bug fixes and features compared to 8.0, and Samsung phones already have those features, and if there are bugs, a small system update is used to eliminate them. Long story short, upgrading to 8.1 is just unnecessary and would cost a lot of time and money with no gain.

And third, people always cry after an update, even about totally unrelated issues. Usually a system update is a good thing, bringing further optimisation, performance and features.",2018-08-02 05:44:07

So there's lots of talk that Samsung is going to ditch the Note line, and the 9 is the last one. Alright, but the question is: when they merge it with the S line, will there still be a variant with the S-pen? This is key for many people who like the pen. If I know that the Note 9 is the last Samsung phone (for the foreseeable future) that will have an S-pen, then I WILL buy one this Fall to ensure I have the best pen experience for years to come.

And I bought one from Staples this week because of the $100 price cut.  I could never rationalize / justify spending top dollar for the latest tablet.  It's a comfort form factor for a couple of games and reading e books, and being online.  I've got a flagship phone.

Security:

The tablet receives just quarterly security patch updates now, not monthly.  Regardless, I use Bit Defender.

120,120,"I feel that battery life and usage is hard to really measure. Every smartphone is going to need to be charged once a day. I have switched between 3 devices this year; iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 10, and Samsung S9. I charge each one to 100% in the evening or overnight and then use it all day the next day. I would consider myself to be an ""average heavy user."" If I am not at work and using my phone for marathon Netflix/games, I will obviously have to charge midday. 

 Coming from iPhone, I love the quick charge on the s9. It is perfect for those ""top up charges"" midday. 

So the whole point of this is that while battery performance is important, it doesn't matter at the end of the day because all smartphones are going to need to be charged daily and all smartphones are going to need a midday top up every once in a while. ",2018-08-04 03:07:15

122,122,"Samsung A8 (2018 edition):

- Flat screen, not curved, which a lot of users like. It is bigger than the 5s but it is still one-handed 

- Excellent performance for a mid tier phone 

- Because it is mid tier, the phone is less expensive than the S series phones and on cheaper plans for most carriers 

- Great camera quality, nice screen for watching videos, and it can do everything you need it to do


(Also, have you thought about iPhone SE? Exact same size and look as the 5s but better performance?)

123,123,"What I like about iPhone X:

- I love the no home button and the gestures. It's so intuitive and makes using a home button to navigate feel old fashioned and slow. 

- The camera is better on the X compared to the S9. Especially selfies.

- I like the way the screen looks on the X when watching videos.


What I like about the s9:

- The Dolby sound is super nice and the sound makes up for the slightly more saturated look when watching Netflix or YouTube 

- The quick charge is super convenient 

- I have better data connectivity when I have my SIM in the S9. It's faster and I have less ""no service"" issues

- I LOVE the Samsung themes and customization. It's super fun

125,125,"Yeah sure. I actually like a lot of the features Samsung puts I to their phone. But one thing that surprised me was my s7 edge slowed down really really badly very recently. If it wasn't for that I probably would've kept it and got a new battery for it but My brother in law had an OG pixel and that was so smooth still when compared to s7e. 

I jumped on a prime day deal for the essential phone and have been loving it. Had Samsung released the note 9 last month I would've bought that because i really felt I needed a new phone and I was dead set on that. But since trying stock Android, I've really liked having the blank canvas that is my phone. So now.... I'm not too sure what I would do when it comes to getting my next new phone and decided to give myself a year with this phone to see if I want the pixel 4 or note 10, or even see if this phone holds up well enough to keep.

It seems more 'optimized' for 8.0 out of the box and seems that further updates are more easily possible on that phone. I get the feeling that Samsung won't update the A5 further than the 8.0.  

What are your thoughts and ideas about this? Is this a legitimate concern? Does it make it a smarter and more future proof decision to purchase an A6 for this reason?",2018-08-04 06:59:37

135,135,"Yeah, I still don't see why phone manufacturers seem to be okay with the current battery life. If you made a survey asking people with a smartphone (doesn't matter which OS or brand), I'm positive almost 100% people would say they want a better battery life. A lot of progress has been made in the last couple of years sure, but the fact that a ""heavy"" user still needs to charge throughout the day seems kinda unrealistic. Especially considering heavy use on a phone won't ever come near the heavy use a computer can do (rendering 4k footage for example). 

Just seems stupid to me when companies like Huawei can fit a 4000 mAh battery in their P20 Pro but Samsung can't in their Plus-sized phone with a higher pixel count and more ""features"" that require battery (such as AOD). Some argue that quick charing makes up for it, and to an extent I can agree. But there are situations where you are unable to charge and it may screw you over big time.

Just a few weeks ago I flying home from Berlin to Stockholm, and the flight was delayed by 2 hours or so. There was no charger near me (trust me, I checked about every corner and place near my gate), and my phone was running low on juice due to it being used quite a lot throughout the day. So now I had like 35% battery, over 4 hours until I get home. Sure the phone survived, but was I able to do much, if anything on it? Not really. Those are the situations where you really need that extra juice. Or if you're on the buss on the way home, or on a train with no charging ports. It is getting more usual to have chargers on busses and trains nowadays, and longer flights too. But still, until we are there, the consumers are the ones to suffer for the companies and their greed.

138,138,Yeah. It's a money thing. For example the Motorola moto z2 force launched last year and only had a 2700 mah battery. That phone was trash at battery life. The z3 launched just recently and it is said to have a 3000 mah battery. Why don't they make the battery like 3500 or something? Because they want their customers to buy that battery moto mod to increase battery. They want you to spend more money on that. Same thing with Apple and Samsung. Why not just put a big battery in all of their phones? Because they want you to spend that extra money on a plus sized phone with a bigger battery if that's what you desire.,2018-08-04 08:58:50

Not to say the app causing it is Direct Chat, but I know some malware-like apps can have this same effect. I would look through your list of installed apps, or try to look for some kind of badge that shows the origin of the chat head. 

Also, with Samsung phones they will track what apps are running in the background or as overlays, but if you have those notifications turned off they'll disappear quickly. To find those notifications, I use an app called Notification Saver so I can see things that are maybe turned off but still appear.

A) is scheduling a service repair, not to inspect it for manufacturing defects.

B)  isn't likely to place someone of the same skill level as someone who can detect defects.

C) is now financially incentivized to say it's not a manufacture defect.

D) I'm essentially stating that I am taking it in to be repaired if I agree to their terms, NOT that i am taking it in to be reviewed for manufacture defects - there's a big difference between the two. 

E) is likely going to ignore my requests and just state that it's not covered and try and charge me since they are adamant that in no way, shape, or form would Samsung consider covering it. Even though they phone reps state they will.

Had it for 2 years and I can say that it's very sturdy in terms of durability and water resistance. Everytime I see a scratch on it, it just turns out to be some sort of paint scratched off from a wall. Worth the money!

Then went back to Samsung and got my note8 which came with a free 128gb micro SD and wireless fast charging pad.

I was under the impression that the whole reason Samsung Pay is enabled to use the Magnetic strip Tech was all because they made a deal with each bank to use the token system through the Magnetic strip tech.

298,298,"I’m honestly thinking of trading my iPhone X for the Note 9.

I’ve been a heavy iPhone user. I’ve owned every model except the 5C, and the 8 and 8+. 

I’ve also owned the galaxy s7, note 7, note 8, and s8+. 

I love my X, primarily for the camera. I have kids and take lots of photos. Currently have 14k photos and 2.5k videos. 

What I’ve enjoyed about the Samsung phones that I don’t get with the iPhone is the following:

- micro SD compatibility
- more customization
- ability to download torrents and easily transfer to pc
- seemed to have more success streaming sports
- I LOVE the s-pen
- I was able to use two telegram accounts on a single phone (used to use a separate account for communicating with coworkers) 
- the cameras were still nice, though photos had different qualities
-seemed more like a pocket pc and less like a smartphone


What I like more about iOS/iPhone :

- Gestures and swiping are much smoother imo
- the video quality has always trumped the Samsung IMO
- iMessage is awesome if you know many people with iPhones
- airdrop is amazing for sharing photos
- FaceTime
- The simplicity (and lack of customization) makes for a more straight forward UI
- Apple Watch &gt; Samsung Gear (excited to see what galaxy watch has to offer)

That’s all I can think of off the top of my head. Happy to answer any questions.

302,302,"It absolutely will not.

The pens still use the same customized passive Wacom EMR tech to function. Meaning the device itself has to have the specific Samsung variant of Wacom's digitizer built into the screen.

So only other Notes, Tab S3 and S4, Tab A with S Pen, and other Galaxy Note tablets (ETA: oh, also the old Wacom-equipped Surface too, since it uses the same pen frequency). It likely doesn't even work on a Wacom tablet or Cintiq, just as previous S Pens didn't (and vice versa for Wacom pens on Galaxy devices).

The 'bluetooth' pairing function has nothing to do with the actual pen input. Just the button on the barrel. It's good for about 200 clicks then can be recharged in the phone in about 40 sec. The S Pen input still functions without a charge. The button still works while touching/hovering over the screen without a charge.

Also, it isn't straight-up Bluetooth. The pen does not show up in the Bluetooth device list and works while Bluetooth is shut off. It uses something else to pair. We tried holding the button to get into some sort of pairing mode and connect our demo unit's pen to the Note 8 somehow...did nothing.

341,341,"First off, if I have the slightest feeling or if the phone has anything wrong with it like how it functions or if the lid is cracked anywhere, I will definitely not attempt to use that phone to trade in, just because I feel like that's how large companies tend to operate their policies and terms of normal wear and tear. On any typical day I usually resell my phone with a charger and case, but thought I'd try out this trade in program for the first time. I have also enjoyed my Samsung phones and experiences with Samsung customer service. I figured the price Samsug was offering was anywhere from $50 to $150 less than the actual value of the phone being traded in to them.

So I participated in the Samsung Trade In Program back on January 30, where I traded in my LG V20 in great condition without any problems or issues of any kind. On June 22, Samsung emailed me stating my phone did not meet the requirements due to damaged housing and buttons. So my Samsung credit account that I opened for the trade in program was charged $225 as they kept my trade-in phone for $25. I have emailed back and forth with Samsung customer service and at least three different representatives have responded now. Everyone responds with the same reason but no one is able to provide any kind of images or reports of any kind that prove my phone is damaged.

I find this scam Samsung is pulling to be very unethical and I want to make sure I get the word out. There's no way I can continue shopping for Samsung after this issue, I only hope they improve their wrong ways and provide the service I have come to know since the Galaxy S2. One of the email responses from Samsung also included the terms of the trade in, and I thought the arbitration agreement to be interesting in this moment. Here is what it says:

11. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT Any dispute you may have with Samsung arising out of or relating to the Trade-In Program or these Terms shall be governed by the Arbitration Agreement (including its 30-day opt-out provision) included in the Samsung Terms and Conditions that apply to the New Samsung Device you purchased using the Trade-In Program. For more information about your rights, obligations, opt-out opportunities and the full terms of the Arbitration Agreement, see [www.samsung.com/us/Legal/Phone-HSGuide/](https://www.samsung.com/us/Legal/Phone-HSGuide/), the printed materials enclosed in the box, or the Legal section of the settings menu of the New Samsung Device you purchased using the Trade-In Program (typically in the “About Device” or “About Phone” section). As stated in such Arbitration Agreement, you agree that any such dispute shall not be combined or consolidated with a dispute involving any other person’s or entity’s claim related to the Trade-In Program, and specifically, without limitation of the foregoing, shall not under any circumstances proceed as part of a class action.

That's interesting. Real talk, not trying to pick sides here. It's an opinion worth noting imo. 

Although, I'll admit the P3 or P2 for that matter, would absolutely not be on my radar.

Edit: I'd like to elaborate. I'm on a Samsung sub. Regardless, that does not mean I'm anti-Pixel. I simply haven't been very impressed with Googles phone offerings since P1, is all. And sadly, that feeling has not changed with the news of P3.",2018-08-09 18:33:27
352,352,"I have been a loyal Samsung customer for several years and are very familiar with the company as a whole. Our last purchases was a refrigerator  with the Family Hub technology and an S9+ phone. We purchased the Samsung Series 8 curved TV in 2016 (UN65KS8500) and enjoyed the 4K technology along with all of the other bells and whistles. It has been a great TV until last month when the TV stopped working. It has been an experience working on getting this fixed. The Samsung customer service in a polite way told me you are on your own we can not help you because your TV is out of warranty. Note, this was a $2,400 investment (TV and sound bar) that cam highly rated by many consumer groups and people alike. At the time of purchase I did not feel like we needed an extended warranty because my two other Samsung TV's are working great (Although my oldest one we had to replace one of the boards in it and it cost \~$300 to get it fixed) and this was one of their premium TV's and \~$300 more dollars for a 3 year extended warranty seemed like a waste of money at the time.

I contacted customer support again and paid for a tech to come out and take a look at the TV and he told me that the control panel was bad and it would cost $1,300 for the panel plus labor. Needless to say I was livid as to how a lightly used 2 year old TV can stop working. For the last couple of weeks I have been reviewing and posting on Samsung's community forum and to my amazement there are several people in my position with the same problem. The general consent from the Samsung moderators is, ""We are sorry to hear this"" to all of us with issues. In a nutshell they are telling us too bad, buy another TV. This TV was an investment not a disposable entity. I am horrified to think if our other products were too fail after the one year warranty was to expire. We were never asking for a replacement or to fix the TV for free but to pay for a repair greater than what the TV is worth is ridiculous! We are now considering other manufacturers if we decide to purchase another TV.

What I would like to convey to you or anyone else is do your homework on all aspects of major purchases especially reliability and warranties. ",2018-08-09 18:39:07

Furthermore, with headphones plugged in, do notification sounds come through the headphones when the phone is set to vibrate? 

Would be really helpful if you could answer this one. 

EDIT - Additional information:

All my Samsung devices thus far have had this issue where notifications play through both the loudspeaker and headphones when headphones are plugged in. I find it extremely annoying because I plug in my headphones not to disturb other people. So when I realised this I started putting my phone on vibrate - but then no notification sound comes through the headphones.

- Video Calling (only if you put your SIM in a real Verizon device temporarily and remove the service block on My Verizon or the site)

439,439,"Thanks for the info I really appreciate it. I don't have a Note 8 but I am thinking about getting the Note 9. 

All my Samsung devices thus far have had this issue where notifications play through both the loudspeaker and headphones when headphones are plugged in. I find it extremely annoying because I plug in my headphones not to disturb other people. So when I realised this I started putting my phone on vibrate - but then no notification sound comes through the headphones. 
I'm starting to believe this may be the case with all Samsung devices. If you don't believe me, try it. If you find a Samsung device that doesn't have this issue then please let me know. 

Dare I say the dreaded i-word...on Apple devices all sound (ringer, notifications, media) are routed through the headphones only when they are plugged in. The only exception are alarms which play though both the headphones and the loudspeaker. 

This might seem picky but it's everyday use cases like this that rub me the wrong way. Yes, it is possible to download third party apps to solve this issue. But I really do feel, that when you are spending this much on a device, the basics should just work out the box. Furthermore, if there are third party apps that solve this issue why can't Samsung have something in their own sound settings - according to your comment there are on certain devices. I sadly don't see this setting on J5 2016, A3 2017, S4, Note 4,  or the S6.

Sorry for the long comment. But I wanted to give a comprehensive reply. I may edit my question because upon reviewing it, it doesn't seem as poignant as I'd like it to be. 

Once again thank you for your reply.

From your perspective I could be ignorant af, and maybe I am. Maybe Samsung devices do have shit batteries, and I basically wasted money on a note 9 with a 4000mah battery that'll degrade to 2000mah after two years, who knows?

Issue here is, no one's actually did solid scientific research about if Samsung's batteries degrade faster than others (I might be wrong tho, if it exists, some good Samaritan could send a link to that research and I'll do some night reading), so no matter how much we argue, we're both going nowhere due to insufficient evidence (a post online saying their batteries died in an hour, doesn't really count as one, too many variables)",2018-09-30 10:27:42

Iphones are just as bad with them slowing down the actual phone speed even on older models through software updates",2018-09-30 10:58:03
16,16,"I would suggest to keep everything at stock - don't go installing themes and icons and use the phone as is. When you start changing themes etc  that's when you start getting overwhelmed and realise the ease of use of an iPhone. 

I would suggest the following. 

1. Install all the apps you usually use
2. Setup your regular biometrics (iris, fingerprint etc. )
3. As previously said in the post go to the advanced features and look through what your phone can provide. 
4. Use your phone as normal and begin to get used to it

After you've gotten used to your phone then you can get to know more about what it can do.  Depending on how tech savvy your wife is I would let her keep using the phone in the most basic way. 

As for apps - Samsung has an issue of providing both the Google and Samsung related apps on the device. Samsung Email and Gmail are both present on the device, also Photos and Gallery are. I personally use Samsung Email as I believe Samsung done a great job on the software but Gmail would be the popular choice to stick with. 

You have the option to uninstall quite a few of the preinstalled apps on the phone.

27,27,"I used all iPhones from 5 to 6s series along with a budget android counterpart. until then, it really felt great. Then came the 7 with unnecessary omissions and practically nothing new to offer but still a premium price. I shifted to the nexus 6p and then the google pixel og, followed by my current note 8. Its safe to say i have used both operating systems extensively. Apple tries to unnecessarily impose their own ecosystem and paralyze the client into using them. If you have an iPhone, you have a phone which can do some extra things, you're still gonna have to be in their ecosystem to make the most out of it. If you have an android, you can do so many amazing things and so many trivial things which u cannot on an iPhone. And then, the note phones are basically a mini computer in your pocket. Majority of the android phones don't try to restrict and thats were the difference lies. If you are an iphone user, for many people they're all into it with iphone for phone related activity, the apple watch, the macbook and so on and this was working well but now they're just exploiting out of it. Many people are so used to this ecosystem that they cannot change even if they want to. I have seen, like i said before, so many iphone users wanting to switch to note 9. But they cant because of apples restrictive and exploiting eco system. And so apple can charge whatever they want and get away with it. 

Consider this, when you buy a note 9, you get the best android flagship out right now which has a base storage of 128gb, which can be expanded to 256 or 512. Apple says, they removed the headphone jack to make more space, Samsung made the note 9 with a headphone jack and actually increasing the battery significantly, its like they're the only company showing a middle finger to whatever apple is doing and following their own thoughts. 

Anyway, back to the point you buy a note 9 base model, not only do you still get a headphone jack, you also get an above average akd tuned earphones to go along with it. And not to mention your brick is fast charging. 

With the iPhone, not only did they remove the jack, they even removed the DONGLE from their box. And now they're capitalising on that opportunity to sell it at a high price on their website or earn money through license. And if you want fast charging? It does not come out of the box. This is mad, this is 2018, and you have to pay 50-100 bucks extra just to get fast charging in a 1000$ phone? 

Then theres the software, super restrictive, basic customisation is lacking. Cant do so many things that a standard android can, forget the note 9 which is basically a powerhouse. I can go on and on but people who want to buy iPhones will buy it.
I wished that people had the guts to just abandon the iPhones for a year or to so that smug apple comes down from their high horse and comes back to the reality. 

Also, when alot of people say SPEED and processing is the concern, dont spend 1.5k or 1k or even 700$.
Get a one plus or any android phone running vanilla android it meets or beats apple in tests and when you see the price difference, its embarrassing really. ",2018-09-30 14:50:42

&gt; Built-in device detection; USB port can provide up to 2.4 amps of power (does not support Quick Charge; devices equipped with Quick Charge will charge at normal speed)


For fast charging Samsung phones, you need at least QuickCharge 2.0 capable chargers.   

QuickCharge 2.0 is rebranded by Samsung as ""Adaptive Fast Charging"" which is mentioned on the top of your Samsung charger.  

QuickCharge 3.0 and 4.0 chargers will charge the phone at QC 2.0 speeds, so don't waste money on a new QC 4.0 charger just yet. 
QC 2.0 chargers are rare to find, so just get a QC 3.0 charger (first result on Amazon search for ""QuickCharge"").

They finally have proprietary CDMA in their modem for next year and won’t have to buy Qualcomm chip anymore if they don’t want to. Qualcomm has been making modems for 3 decades whereas Samsung entered modem market only since 2014; and unexpectedly got its baptism through fire when that years Qualcomm modem had an overheating issue which forced Samsung to launch their brand new modem with galaxy devices, and it survived. All I am saying is, to remain in context of the title, if Samsung themselves hold them back from launching their modem in the US to top tier devices, others will lack some confidence in buying them too. Given how late they entered the industry, they deserve every praise for reaching neck to neck with everyone else so quick.

The new iPhone XS uses intels modem and ditched Qualcomm for the first time, who also entered modem market only 4 years ago. nVidia and HiSilicon and MediaTek are all competent and powerful modems too. Qualcomm may still have a slight performance edge, but that gap is closing fast. Samsung is also right behind Qualcomm in the 5G research and contribution to the 3GPP spec and standards, let’s see. Pretty soon we’ll see 5G and IOT capable devices and Exynos will be an equal or superior modem. Samsung’s own millions of appliances will use their own modems for IOT, so it’s a win win.

Well I’ve read that the S4 is a hell of a tablet but the one thing to keep in mind is what you are going to be using it for. The iPad is going to have the better tablet apps if that’s a part of your buying decision. Also keep in mind that android tablets on the whole are on the way out with google focusing on chrome OS tablets with android app support. I’m sure Samsung will support this tablet for at least two years but I’d also keep that in mind as well. ",2018-10-02 21:06:54

I disabled the Bixby button and set Google as my voice assistance, and as I'm using a different launcher I don't accidentally activate the Bixby home screen either.

Just like the OP I understand that Samsung want to include their own software in a device they made, and I believe they should be allowed to do just that. It does surprise me though that people need to use a different launcher to avoid it seeing it.",2018-10-04 07:26:08
200,200,"I don't get you, you can simply disable bixby button to do nothing, and turn off bixby on homescreen, it would only come back when Samsung Home Experience updates, but that takes like 5 sec to disable, and that post took you more then that. You could also disable it totally with adb so it never comes back if it's bothering you so much.",2018-10-04 07:26:09
201,201,"&gt; I don't want to have to change a launcher, but that is definitely an option at the moment! I just don't understand Samsung's approach to this.

I think you do understand it; you just don't agree with it.  I don't agree with it either, to be clear, but I think you understand it: it's Samsung doing what any company who wants their customers to adopt their particular flavor of the month/year: they try to force it on consumers and see what sticks.  Sometimes they're more obnoxious or accepting than others.  Apple took 3 iterations of the iPhone to finally admit that customers wanted copy and paste.  Microsoft has tried to jam Bing and Edge down our throats using various methods for years.  And Samsung is using an easily (and accidentally) pressed button to try to force usage of Bixby.  It's the same thing; just a different product and company.

This is Samsung being Samsung.  If you otherwise like their products, just buy [bxActions - Remap Buttons](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamworks.bxactions) and [Package Disabler Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.powermanager.batteryaddon) and call it good.  Yes, you have to spend around $6.50 (total) to get the phone to work the way you want.  No, you shouldn't have to do this.  But once you do, and spend around an hour learning how to disable Bixby, you're done.

Consider it this way: how much time did it take you to write this post?  While I don't doubt it was cathartic, it did take time.  Also consider how much you make in an hour at your job.  Does it exceed $6.50?  Most likely.  So you're going to spend an hour of your time making at least $6.50 to buy the apps, and another hour to learn to use them and get your phone set up the way you want.  Then you're done, and can move on with your life.  Is two hours of your time worth not having to deal with this?  Is the price of coffee and a donut (or two) worth getting rid of this stress you're dealing with?  I'd posit that it is.  :-)

As an aside, consider using [Nova Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher).  No, not because of Bixby; because it's a much better launcher with many nice options.  You don't have to, but I'll bet you'll like it better.  Yes, it's worth the $0.99 upgrade to Prime, but you can try it before you do so don't worry about that.  Also use the Samsung Apps app to download Good Lock and its associated apps.  They're all free and offer a ton of nice functionality options.",2018-10-04 07:59:17
202,202,"The problem is that you shouldn’t have to turn it off every time SE updates. That’s ridiculous. 

If I turned it off I made that decision for a reason. It should remain disabled until the user changes it. No custom launcher or extra app should be required to turn off such a pointless and intrusive feature, because that is what it is. 

I turned it off plenty more times than I updated SE and that’s what made me give up on Samsung. On iOS I expect something to be shoved down my throat, but that’s not android-style at all, that’s why 99% of all people claim they get an android “freedom of choice”. Samsung just removes that freedom. ",2018-10-04 08:08:59
203,203,"In short? Is a dark pattern.

Longer version: In user experience design (the design of a product or service from the perspective of usability and accessibility rather than just aesthetics), there's a concept called a ""pattern"". This means a design or style of a particular interface that allows someone to do something. Translated into real world terms, an example would be the way a particular app allows you to type in text, or adjust your volume, or upload a file. On the web, a UX pattern might be how a particular website allows you to login, or the process by which you would add a product to your shopping cart, choose to check out, and then finalize your purchase.

There's another concept, not as commonly discussed: a dark pattern. This is a UX (user experience) decision that is made to serve the purposes of the company and priorities this decision over (and sometimes to the exclusion of) goals or desires of a user. An example of this is a site that requires you to make an account and login before they will allow you to view their content (even when it's free), or that keeps bothering you with pop ups asking you to allow notifications or to sign up for a mailing list.

Sometimes this is just poor design. However, when the company is aware of an intended goal of the user, and interrupts that goal in order to push an alternative desired by the company on the user instead, that is when poor design becomes a dark pattern.

What you are experiencing here is a dark pattern. You want to just use your phone, if you want Google Assistant to be your default virtual assistant. Samsung would rather you use Bixby instead. They are so determined to try to ""help"" you make this decision that they are degrading the user experience in order to accomplish that goal. No, it's not usually considered wise by those of us who designed user experiences. Unfortunately, we are only the ones making the recommendations, not the ones making the decisions. You can thank Samsung corporate product management/ownership for that.

So that's the ""why"". Yes, it's stupid. But it's the way it is, has been, and will be for the foreseeable future. It isn't just Samsung; it is true of most large organizations on the planet.",2018-10-04 08:30:09

Release the keys, and when the Android Recovery pops up (you'll know it's the one when you get the message **""Downloading Update""** or similar.) This is not an actual update, and after the screen is gone, Android Recovery will show. Navigate down using the volume keys and select **Wipe cache partition** with the Power button and select **Yes**. After this, go down to **Reboot system**. The phone will start up as usual.

As for the memory, the available RAM seems about right. On an android phone, the amount of RAM available can be small, as the OS will use as much of it as possible for cache. The phone will adjust as needed, without a slowdown. The browsers that come by default are chrome and maybe the Samsung browser, which I actually like.

Now, the earbuds sounds amazing, yes amazing, is like 75% of the akg's volume,bass is enough, mids and highs sounds good and can cause ear problems if you go all the way, now,thanks to the noise cancellation the volume don't need to be that high. 

Today i used the iconx to a level never expected, since I'm using it longer than before i put a giant playlist on the iconx memory, the battery lasted from 10:15 am till 4:45 with 5% remaining of battery, according to Samsung 4 to 5 hours is estimated time it should lasted if the music is onboard, if you talk and stream music from the phone the iconx normally last like 3.5 to 4 hours unstop.

The case provides another full charge, and charges pretty fast, use usb-c so since you have an N8 is one less cable to worry about.

Love the controls can be used in both sides, you can change the volume, songs, play list, voice control etc in any of the earbuds. 

The water proofing is top notch.

Again about the noise cancellation, is smazing, you can ride the trains or been anywhere and theres no ambient noise that can get to your ear, you're completely isolated from the world. Oh but don't worry, the iconx have some kind of microphone that can be activated and set for higher or lower settings  that allows you to listen yours surrounding, even have a voice boost so it recognizes and amplifies human voices. 

Portability is great, you can jump, twist your hear like the exorcist and the iconx will stay put and sounding great.

What i hate ? Would love a 8+ hours battery life.

If i would buy it again ?  Hell yeah.  I love the low profile and giant sound this things have, the onboard memory is a more than welcome feat and a life saver when your phone battery is dying.

I understand that the price of the device are going tru the sky and resale value is going down fast but that's what you have when the innovations are so high and so fast like we get 9n android, in the apple side you can pile those and a bit chunk of ppl would have a hard time telling you witch iphone is, because they look inside and outside the same, performance improvements are marginal, and most user still debating that apple is the one bringing the new things to the market. 

Around 8 months ago i was talking to my friend and he told me how angry he was on android with so many customizations that was hard for him to keep it up (he was an apple user b4) i told him that was good because he can get a phone tailored to his need, after defending why apple charged him 60$ for a fast charger that has been free for years and still faster on samsung he told me ""i need no options"" i just told him this: if you father is a buss driver why are you're studing in college ? Why ? because you love your father but you don't need to be a copy of him, you wanna do your own stuff.  That's called options.

I tend to keep my phones long time, i tend to don't  buy at regular price, so when i sell my devices the resale value doesn't affect me that much. I paid like 535ish for my note 8 (the truth was free) in lunch day in tmobile, so if i hold it for one more year and sell it in 400ish is ok with me. If not then i keep it just like i did with my note 4 that still in my drawer just in case of emergency, or just pass it to my daughter (she need an upgrade fast, she have a 70$ samsung for the last 2 years, prior was a 40$ nokia that she loved it till i left it in the roof of the car then took off)

Few weeks ago i was making the case here in reddit about how stupid the prices were going and that i may make the jump for a popcophone F1 if my n8 fail, the popcophone is laking a lot if features that my phone has,  but is time to stand up and start patronizing new players that give us a better value for our hard earned money. now please explain me how can you do that in the apple side with apple controlling 100% of the sale, resale, os, production, repair, repair parts, even the apps that you can use ?

Yeah pretty much like as I said only thing is that bug I had where the case kept charging them after the lights turned green so it drains case battery in a few hours but resisting earbuds trough that small button on them fixed it so not really a big deal at the end.. And resorting process is like hold for 7-8s release and than hold for 3-4s light flash red and that's it repeat for the other one pair again and you're done.. And the button is under that small tip that holds the outer rubber thing (you can find how to on yt or samsung support site if you'll need it)..

But these have really good sound (close to standard akg earbuds that you get with samsung phones) good battery life 4.5/5h (which I actually hit) also the case can last for a lot.. It has only one charge but if you not use the buds all the way the case will add that battery life and stop charging so it's doesn't waste the charge.. But basicly I charge the case every 4-5-6 days.. Touch controls are pretty good so you don't have to pull out the phone all the time.. Walking/running tracking works surprisingly fine .. I did watched some other comparisons and for their price range these are usually in the top..

And yeah they fit really well and don't tend to fall out somehow haha so I would recommend them for sure but are they the best not sure but if you have some samsung stuff already you might simply get the buds from samsung too ",2018-10-11 21:15:44

I think an apple battery swap is 69 after this current “we are embarrassed” 29 dollar discount. 

I see both markets.. and while you dislike iOS, the hardware keeps its value and use, while still getting first party upgrades. Samsung just releases low end new phones and calls it good.

106,106,"Speed in phones isn't all. Firstly you guys dropped the fingerprint sensor... for a notch... You use Samsung OLED technology and pretty much pass it off as an apple innovation, OLED comes froom 2002 or somewhere close to that.

Apple will last longer, with less features, be more polished and cost more. Samsung will last 2-3 years, more features, can be buggier, can game better than Iphones due to their superior GPUs, have better useability (headphone jack, USB-C etc.) Apple phones do maintain their value, but if you have a trade in plan it makes no difference, or if you use it until it dies it makes no difference. Repairing an S-Device is cheaper than an Apple device. The Samsung eco-system co-ensides with the Andriod one making it much more universal for the mainstream PC users, or anyone who does enterprise/business/server based work. I can run python code on it for example.

Even if you have those issues you stated with S-deives, try the pixel. Pixels are supperior to Apple devices in nearly everyway, (excluding the XL's notch, eww) Firstly, the products last, they get supported for just as long as Apple devices, they get the BEST ecosystem currently available, they are nearly as fast as an IPhone, have a fingerprint sensor and face scanning, etc. etc. 

Again, Apple has its place for people who do not want a feature rich phone, someone who wants a super easy to use device and cannot follow the Andriod ecosystem. However they're overpriced, practically scam you at repairs (do I need to get Louis Rossman?)

The ONLY component that is worse on andriod devices is the CPU, EVERYTHING else equal, or in some cases better, take the batteries, I don't know ANY flagship andriod phone that came out this year with a smaller battery. I don't know of ANY andriod phone that came out this year without an SD card reader. 

Again, personal preferance, but I like to be able to tinker with my device, if you wish to not do that then fine.

This is why there's Isheep. You don't fully look at the specs of these devices, you don't fully research the life the and look at value charts.

LTE, 256GB of storage &amp; 6GB of ram is fantastic. and yeah Amoled rules all and the S-Pen is genius. loving this stuff. but at this $1000 price point, this config should be STANDARD and also include the SD845, with a Huawei-like guarantee that the S4 will be lag-free for 18 months.

The longer answer is that the notches allegedly cost less to manufacture (possibly due to where / how the display is connected to the board), and patents for things like curved displays can be prohibitively expensive or impossible for other companies to license from Samsung.

Samsung also has tremendous manufacturing capability; their fabrication facilities are much larger than most of their competitors.

I never use assistants ever - I'm usually in a public setting where I feel weird talking to my phone, it's usually faster to just use the touchscreen instead, and speech to text isn't super accurate. I never use Bixby or Assistant, and I wish I could do things without assistants getting shoved in my face - Cortana, Assistant, Bixby, Alexa, etc. Just no. I however love the Bixby button; after remapping it with bxActions, it's so great to have a hardware back button. I could never go without that button anymore. I do love the 18:9 aspect ratio. My phone is about the same physical size as my previous Pixel XL, but it has waaaaay more screen real estate. I love it, it's great for browsing Reddit or watching TV. Emphasis on the TV, as most things on TV are widescreen and do not fit to the 16:9 aspect ratio used by moth devices.",2018-11-03 17:49:37

From the looks of it, this is a (as you can very obviously read on the right) spectrum analyzer of the signal received through the TV antenna. I have no idea how to disable or (or enable it for that matter) and your best luck would be if some Samsung engineer or repair shop owner would find his own way here and tell you what to specifically do to disable this.

https://www.samsung.com/au/support/tv-audio-video/smart-tv-how-to-perform-a-factory-data-reset/

Basically, while the TV is on, press and hold the Exit button on the Samsung remote control for 12 seconds, after which the TV should display a warning dialog which you can use the remote control to choose ""OK"" on which does a full factory reset.

With that said, I'm in agreement here with others that the image you're seeing is likely somehow coming from your cable provider, since it only appears when you apparently have the cable connected to the back of the set.

You could test this theory (whether the image is coming from your cable provider or not) by connecting a different television to the cable and seeing whether or not you see this image on that TV.

Your analysis is spot on.

When someone comes in with an S7/S7 edge the grand majority (85%+) are doing whatever they can to replace it or have it ""fixed"". Where as when people come in with even the iphone 6 maybe 10-20% are having an issue. Most want to replace them because they feel ""its time"".

I've learned that many samsung devices do very poorly with software as its upgraded. When someone comes in with a Note 3 / S5 its typically a stun if they work well.

I've been a note person since the Note3 and never had issues because I changed my phone yearly. Most people cant do that.

I do feel like Samsung hopefully beat that curve with the S8 series devices and should have more regularly long lasting devices from this point (at least 3-4 years commonly). Time will tell.

223,223,"sorry, nope.  I Haven't seen that problem.  Running on AT&amp;T or Verizon?  Also the problem mignt not even be Samsung but the carrier update.

the way it works is that Samsung makes the update but doesn't send it off to the consumer unless you buy unlocked WITH Exynos processor.  

then update goes to Verizon, AT&amp;T, Sprint, T Mobile, etc and those guys add their shit to it.  Generally I see NO PROBLEMS with a Samsung patch but instead of the carrier but everyone blames Samsung when there's a problem after an update. LOL",2018-11-05 16:18:27

228,228,"Have you checked the *Backup and Restore* settings in the Secure Folder app? Is it turned on or off? Try turning it on and off again, see if it stops it from uploading data.

&amp;#x200B;

[This Samsung support page](https://support.samsungknox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012597828-Can-I-to-backup-Secure-Folder-data-) indicates the app has a backup feature that sends the data contained in the Secured Folder, to the Samsung Cloud servers. The available space on this cloud storage seems to vary depending on the phone's storage space, from 16 GB to 64 GB. The [official page](https://www.samsungknox.com/fr/solutions/personal-apps/secure-folder) about the feature also shows [this series of screenshots](https://kp4-cdn.samsungknox.com/img/ubDblM0nPwzRsVnS.jpg), that show the feature is made to backup GBs of data automatically.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems the issue of the app using background data, even when asked to not do this, is a common one: I found multiple threads about it online, none had any explanation unfortunately.

[This one](https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/forums/v3_1/forumtopicpage/board-id/OtherMobile/thread-id/15029/page/1), on the Samsung community platform, even took an ugly turn: a Samsung moderator/technician seems to be have became aggressive and very unprofessional - so much that another Samsung moderator had to remove all their messages to not risk a scandal - when responding to a calm and civil question of a Samsung customer about the odd issue.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't used Secure Folder (ex-Knox) yet, but I suspect the app is either:

\- uploading some encryption information (keys and such, several are already on the device, including hardware-based ones) to their servers, for law-enforcement purposes (remember that it got the greenlight of a certain agency years ago, which mean they have been working directly with them for long enough)

\- uploading some ""telemetry"" data for their own internal usage (so downloading all sorts of information about your device and how it's used)

\- improperly backing up some of the user's personal data on the Samsung Cloud servers, despite being told not to do that in the settings",2018-11-05 16:58:13

244,244,"I appreciate the help and response. 

I didn't have Backup and Restore enabled in Secure Folder. I've never added my account in there either. 

It's difficult to say though. If I look at the Apps setting menu and I look at Secure Folder, it'll say it hasn't used any mobile data. But under Mobile Data Usage, it says it has used 16mb this month. I don't know. 

Either way, yeah, I guess it's kind of a weird feature. I've always been kind of weary of Secure Folder. I thought it was weird it would have a cloud backup feature. I thought that kind of defeated the purpose of it. Also, the fact that there's a retrieve/reset password function on Secure Folder suggests to me that Samsung backs up the encryption keys as well. 
",2018-11-06 06:03:44
245,245,"Thanks for the follow-up, it's quite an intriguing situation indeed.

I think you should trust the Mobile Data Usage over the Secure Folder app regarding the bandwidth consumption, many other users report large amount of data usage (visible on their telco website and bills!), despite the Secure Folder app saying it's not using anything.

I think the Secure Folder feature on Samsung phones is only meant to provide minimum data security against random smartphone thieves off the street, stealing a corporate (or [BYOD/COPE/POCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device)) device, not knowing it's not just a strictly personal one.

Looking at Knox various products, they all seem geared toward one goal: allowing corporations to restrict, backup, lock, locate and remote-wipe a fleet of devices. It does not protect against invasive surveillance agencies, big corps spying on home users, or fully-fledged industrial espionage.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I gathered, *Secure Folder* is basically making all Samsung smartphone users an *employee* of the Samsung corp, in a Knox environment: **Samsung** can backup, lock, locate and remote-wipe all ""their"" Samsung devices, not the users themselves.

So, while as an *employee* of the Samsung corp, you can ask them to do all these actions for you, by logging in on your Samsung account - they're still the ones with all the admin rights and access to the Knox tools installed on ""your"" device.

**The user is definitely not the admin** here, despite being the legal owner of the smartphone (as a physical good).

\_\_\_

PS: thinking a little more about it, it's the sort of trade-off that usually comes with a seemingly ""free"" service: with *Secure Folder*, the user does not need to set up their own backup/remote-lock/wipe server, nor do all the maintenance work (patching, tweaking, etc), nor pay anyone to do that job for them - but in return the user does not control the system's settings at all: **Samsung got all the keys** and do whatever they want with these.

At this point, *if you're not using your own encryption tools,* it's choosing between giving your confidential data to a potential thief (if the device ever gets stolen or lost), or giving it to *Samsung &amp; Associates* right from the start.

It reminds me of security products (like BitDefender) installing [Man In The Middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) exploits on their users' devices, to see their encrypted traffic, to supposedly analyze it and detect any malware/phishing attempts: what is the point of a security software, if it bring such a massive vulnerability to the device?

Here, what is the point of securing confidential data, if it's only to give it all to *Samsung &amp; Associates* ?  

I can't even imagine how incredibly powerful an unlimited access to Samsung's Knox servers would be: accessing the most valuable data of millions of devices, with an automatic updating service keeping the data fresh and accurate.",2018-11-06 07:03:59

308,308,"It seems like a pretty straightforward answer - ipad pro. Maybe it is in general.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT...here's my two cents (note: I haven't used any ipad pros, nor any chromebooks)

I never understood this 'productivity tablet' thing. Especially for a 10"" device. I don't know how good ipad pro is at various tasks, but it seems like a niche productivity device - it's good at drawing and various other graphics work, at least the 13""  version. Everything else is just marketing mumbo jumbo to get you to buy the crazy expensive garbage keyboards. Maybe it's also good at note taking and things like that, but that is where Samsung excels as well.

For me personally, S4 beats the ipad because it's a far better media consumer device - screen ratio, amoled &gt; 120Hz, storage expandability. Plus, I love DEX as well. I don't understand this 'apps not updated for tablet'\* thing. Built-in apps are awesome. Plex runs fine, Kodi and VLC as well and I use Telegram without any issues. All in all, I find this device to sit deeply in the 'better than the sum of its parts' territory.

&amp;#x200B;

I also got the POGO dock for the S4 for cheap (\~$30). Currently the daily board is just a glorified photo frame, if that, but supposedly S4 will get Bixby voice in 2019, and I hope they improve the daily board to act more as a smart display. One good thing about the POGO dock is that it's as good as wireless chargers, in that you just place the tab in it and it charges. It takes a couple of attempts to learn how to quickly lock the pins, but after that it just, well, clicks :). One great downside of the dock is that you can't use it with Samsung's covers. I have a book cover (non-keyboard) and it covers the pogo pins as well, and even if it didn't, it makes the thing too thick to fit in the slot.

386,386,"I can't blame Samsung for not pushing OneUI to the s8 and note 8 (I'm writing this on my note 8). It's a completely new UI it's not like apples ""new UI"" where nothing actually changes it just has a swipe up instead of a home button. OneUI changes literally everything. That's a substantial amount of work per phone model. Another reason is they want and need people to switch from note 8 to note 9 and before OneUI I don't think anyone can really justify an upgrade from the note 8 to note 9. 

That's just my opinion on this specific issue. I still receive updates on my s6 that I use as a backup. But thankfully they don't try to push UI updates like Apple does killing the battery life and speed of the older phones. 

Just because we don't get new UI updates for 5 years doesn't mean it's a bad thing. New UI's are optimized for new hardware. Old hardware struggles to run them. ",2018-11-08 10:33:16

393,393,"&gt;Now, we don’t have any reason yet to doubt the validity of this report, but given what we know this simply raises a lot of questions. One UI is Samsung’s new UX that’s based on Android 9 Pie, just like Samsung Experience 9.0 was Samsung’s UX for Android 8.0 Oreo and Samsung Experience 9.5 was their UX for Android 8.1 Oreo. Samsung has previously confirmed that Android Pie would be coming to the Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8, and a handful of A series and J series phones. It seems unlikely that Samsung would backtrack on releasing Android Pie for the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy Note 8, but it also seems unlikely to us that they would roll out an Android Pie update without the new interface changes in One UI. After all, that would mean Samsung has to maintain multiple versions of their Android Pie software, and not just add/remove whatever features they deem inaccessible for older devices.

&gt;It is possible that the spokesperson gave out incomplete information, so we reached out to Samsung Mobile for clarification and will update this article if we hear back from them.

I'm gonna remain skeptical for now.",2018-11-08 11:33:41

If you play any games on your phone - iOS is the place to be. I'm not a big phone gamer, I typically play crossword puzzles. But some of the best games in that genre are on iOS. 

But, there is the walled garden of Apple. It's not as big of a deal as r/Samsung makes it out to be but it is there. How much do you customize your phone? Do you use a file explorer often?

446,446,"On the every company will adopt this but Samsung being first note, aren’t most companies already trying to be predictive and gesture based to improve navigation anyways? Like just within stock Android P there are so many gestures, predictive actions and google assistant triggers to help minimize user interaction . In the cases of contacts and clock, a lot of the top UI elements are elements you shouldn't want to interact with frequently. Contacts for example, the button on the top prevents accidental activation of edits while also freeing up space and clutter from the bottom for things you actually use. If you want an example for how cluttering around the bottom can lead to confusion, just look at iOS 12's messages app, almost all the actions are on the bottom half of the screen, all the iMessage apps, media inputs and of course the keyboard. Yes, everything is reachable, but all the different menu tabs and layers just make everything confusing. I think that while the gesture ideas from One UI are a move in the right step, just plain moving everything to the bottom but having pop-ups and layers is just silly. iOS's implementation of bars at the bottom of most apps, first or third party still looks to work well compared to Android's top accessible side menus. Having the most important actions on the bottom - great, putting everything down there - confusing. Though my opinion may not matter, my fingers are long enough to handle a Note 9 or a XS Max in one hand.

FYI, Apple still has their guidelines, now renamed the Human Interface Guidelines, available for macOS, iOS, tvOS and WatchOS.

TLDR, gestures already work for most of the screen and predictive suggestions are already working on reducing user actions anyways. Is Samsung really first?",2018-11-09 07:29:32

448,448,"Idk... I'm not all that excited. Seems like some of the ""improvements"" come with drawbacks. Like in the messaging app, you have huge MESSAGES on the top half of the screen, but why? When you start scrolling, conversations fill up the whole screen regardless.. Same with Bixby screen. Why do I need huge Hi, Name on the top? I get that it moves content down but I rather have more, nicely laid out content and information than black space.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not some big revolution, iOS figured it out from the beginning when it comes to one handed use. have tabs on the bottom, use swipe gestures anywhere to go back, have interaction menus on the bottom, etc. When Google introduced tabs on the top, at least at first they supported swiping between them, but with time they retracted all that and now with MD2 their apps are shifting to what UI/UX that iOS has been using for ages. I don't blame them, it just works, especially with constantly increasing phone sizes. Now Samsung realizes that it is the way to go as well.

&amp;#x200B;

It was just funny to see Samsung talk about improving UX and essentially showing how they are making their skin more and more like iOS. Again don't get me wrong, I like change but I think they want to put a spin on what iOS has been doing for years, but I don't think it is functionally better. Also, iOS is far from perfect and whoever decided to put the control center in the top right corner should really not be making decisions again :D",2018-11-09 07:37:17

Samsung, on the other side, designs Exynos SoC with built in modem and the custom cores (like Apple) but then **it is Samsung themselves that make** the chip. Unfortunately, due to Qualcomm and some US carriers, the Samsung modem can't be in the US phones, so Samsung has to put a Qualcomm chip in the US version of the phone. By doing this you won't get a fully designed by Samsung hardware. BTW Qualcomm is also killing modding and competition by forcing other companies to always use their chip, maybe in the future these carriers will drop CDMA and we'll get the same phone worldwide with same nodding and quicker updates.

29,29,"So, hi. 

&amp;#x200B;

We know. S-Voice was never designed to be a proper voice assistant. It was built and put into product roadmaps as a way to do text-to-speech commands, like ""Call mom"" or ""Send a text"". Those functions are basic requirements for the hardware category, so if Bixby wasn't ready or couldn't be supported by hardware planned for 1-2 years out, it got S-Voice, which was developed many years ago. Retrofitting Bixby onto those devices is, unfortunately, lower priority than trying to make it work well on the primary devices (i.e. phone and TV). Samsung is big, but it doesn't have infinite time and resources.

&amp;#x200B;

As for Bixby, the plan is eventually for everything to have it. Watches, TV, fridge, all connected to the same voice assistant, tied to your Samsung Account and Samsung Cloud. All talking to each other, subtly learning in the background when to turn on lights, what Youtube videos to suggest in your feed, etc. But Bixby was basically rebuilt after the S8 when Viv ([http://viv.ai/](http://viv.ai/) ) was integrated, so when specs and roadmap for various products were being design,  the choice was either put the 1.0 version of Bixby into the Galaxy Watch, Iconx, etc, only for them to be obsolete and out of step with the New Bixby on the phone by the time they came out, or to focus efforts on a single experience for the next generation. We chose the latter. If you watch DJ Koh's presentation at our developer's conference, that's the vision he laid out.

&amp;#x200B;

Other ecosystems aren't exactly nailing this right now either. Trying to set an alarm on a Google Home vs on your phone will show you that they don't interact at all. Siri is just a straight up mess between the Apple TV, Watch, and HomePod (which is missing the vast majority of functionality). No one uses Alexa on their phones, even if they use it daily on their Echo. Etc. Everyone is about a generation behind where consumers want us to be.

My case: My note 9 get a bug. Carrier can't do anything. Come to samsung store and they fix it.

Full story as follow: I'm in Australia and I get a note 9 two weeks ago from a private deal through facebook. The phone was sealed and branded with optus (1 of the largest carriers in Oz). Last week, after an update, my note 9 get a weird bug so I bring my phone to an Optus store, they told me all the warranty should go with Samsung. So I bring my note 9 with proof of purchase to samsung store. They check the phone IMEI and it is the same in POP. After that, they just flash my device to factory software.

So, if you still have your receipt, go to nearest samsung store and ask for hardware checking/warranty.",2018-12-01 05:02:36

You will have an option to turn your galaxy into a mini computer if you stick it in a DeX pad/station.

Also, s9 has newer software and get update longer than s8. As you are using ipX, you will find samsung has more option to customise your phone (font size/style, home screen lay out, wallpaper,... Etc). You can multi-task on your phone (split screen in 2 and using 2 apps at the same time). 

However, you will get lag and stuttering sometimes because s8 or even s9 chip (especially exynos version, which much likely you will get in UK) is way inferior to apple A11 chip. You can make your phone smoother by unlock developer options and scale down animation time. ",2018-12-01 05:43:12

When we (my family and I) went to get our first smartphones we were set on iPhones because we were familiar with the OS through owning an iPod touch. The S3 had recently been released and the employees at the Verizon store had suggested we take a look at the S3. Boom, we were sold! The customizability was fascinating, and it was easier to use (surprisingly) compared to the iPhone. 

The S3 wasn't perfect, but Samsung has continued to improve and I'll absolutely be a customer for life.

Also turning the option to split window every app in developer options so you can split window the apps that aren't allowed.

- Customisation is great (my favorite thing about android) watch some videos and learn how to use KWLP and KWGT and look at some set ups and you can completely change the way you use your phone.

- Themes, I use a full amoled dark one which is 100% better than the white background and what everyone on r/apple is begging for. If you get the Samsung experience 10 one from XDA (one I use) it also changed 90% of stock apps to black plus the look and layout of things.
You can also change the font, I'm currently using a Google Sans one that I recently downloaded from XDA and it looks great.

- Goodlock. 100% recommend. Another customisation app and it has capabilities to change most of the UI by the way it looks and customising the colors of the notification and system tray for example.

- enabling developer mode so you can change shit like animation speeds for example.

- get Nova Prime, another absolute must. It's probably the most customisable launcher out there and works great with KLWP.

•Enjoy downloading outside of the app store, but be careful. Get all the free tv, music, movies you want, plus apps that got pulled from the store. You can use AVG free (antivirus, seems the least intrusive), and I'd  be careful with torrent apps if your not familiar. Your ISP or carrier could send you a naughty note, or kick you off. If you stream movies, you're in the clear.
•Use Samsung Pay. You might as well get free stuff for money you are already spending, and its secure. If your bank card isn't supported, you can add your PayPal. You're gonna get alot of ""We don't take Apple Pay"", but Samsung Pay uses MST so it will work almost anywhere you can swipe. Always select credit on the pay station, you've already pinned in on the phone.
•Set up secure folder. If you use your phone for work/personal, it's a good way to seperate your gallery, email apps, notes, etc. Or, maybe, you just want to hide shit. You can use it for that too. You hide or disguise the icon. You can also set up a dedicated fingerprint for it, so one finger opens the regular home, and the other opens secure folder. It also has a self destruct if passcode is entered incorrectly too many times.
•Bixby works....if you work on it. I feel like people complain about it, but mine works great. It's as smart as you make it though. If you ""teach"" it when it understands incorrectly or does the wrong command, it learns and corrects. If you don't, it won't. Mine is doing three-chain commands like a pro now, but I used and taught it. Quick Commands are awesome!
•Connect to a PC? Use Samsung Flow. Transfer stuff back and forth quickly (uses WiFi Direct for large files), unlock PC from your phone with biometrics.

AFAIK the Tab S3 and the Tab S4 are the only tablets that come with a stylus. You could always get a capacitive stylus as that'll work with any tablet so you'll have a a bit more choice.

134,134,"If you Google something like ""different Samsung tablet series"" you'll probably find some comparisons, but really all you need to know is that S series is the flagship, A is mid-tier, E lower-end. If stylus is a must then your options will be limited to just a few models (note that while capacitive styli will work with any touch screen they are as accurate as using your finger... AKA useless if you're looking for a pen-and-paper experience). The current S4 will be out of your price range, but the older S3 is definitely a strong contender. There's also a Tab A 10.1 with S-Pen, but that model also comes in a much more widely avalable penless model so if that's something you're interested in buying make sure you're not confusing one model for the other. S-Pens will only work on certain devices because those devices have an additional hardware layer as a screen component, so you can't just buy a random cheapo tablet and hope that an S-Pen will work on it. The Tab A with S-Pen has 3GB of RAM compared to the normal one's 2 GB but other than that (and obviously the higher price for the former) they're basically the same.

140,140,"My apologies for the necropost, but this was the most relevant thread for me to add to. 

My two cents on the issue is that the S9 likes to throw the moisture error when you're using a non-oem charger. I was using a dollar store cable and an Alcatel 2.0amp wall block, and if I restarted my phone while it was charging, it would give the moisture error. It would make sense that the S9 detects ""moisture"" by detecting an unexpected voltage/amperage/charging abnormality of any sort. Switched to the oem samsung wall block and still using the dollar store cord, and so far so good. 

I do believe this feature is less than perfect, and this won't be everyone's fix, but if all else fails, please try the oem block (and cord, probably).",2018-12-03 22:31:36

187,187,"I bought a phone recently (got it just yesterday) and my choice was between Huawei P20 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S9+ (not the same, but similar).

Generally speaking, Huawei phones have bigger battery, faster charging, faster updates and usually lower price point. However, I don't like EMUI (their skin on top of Android). It just feels... Chinese. About the camera... A lot of people argue that P20 Pro and Mate 20 Pro have the best cameras out there (they even hold the high score on DxO Mark), but this depends. They take incredible photos, especially at night, but they oversharpen a lot and IMO the photos don't look natural.

Samsung phones have better screen, better build quality, better performance and IMO (and according to a lot of people) better software. Overall they're just better phones - even if they don't stand out that much with a certain feature, they're better all-rounders. However, since you're an Apple user, you might find the Samsung software a bit too alien (Huawei's EMUI is closer to iOS).

I bought the S9+ eventually and I'm super happy. A girl I'm dating bought recently the P20 Pro and I know that if I bought it, I would have made a compromise simply because of the low light camera.

Samsung experience is better, and one UI even better. you save 200$ and get headphone jack, no notch, better screen, better build, better battery, pen. However, youll have worse camera, slower charging, worse cpu (Huawei's kirin is really good, much better than snapdragon or the exynos.)

Also will mention, the Huawei has better face recognition, Indisplay fingerprint reader (if you care) and note 9 has the fingerprint reader at the back.

191,191,"I have the exact same problem and searched a lot about it.

I think there is no solution to this, unfortunately.

Even changing the subtitles to grey or yellow does not help a lot, on netflix for example you can set the subtitles to be semi-transparent but it only works on SDR content. HDR will ignore this setting and show a full-strong coloured subtitle.

I understand that edge-lit displays do not have the best local dimming of the market but the bright subtitles on very dark scenes ruins the experience. The whole display ""lights up"" when someone speaks and the subtitle appears and then it goes back to the appropriate darkness when no one is speaking (no subtitles).

It's very noticiable and very annoying but I don't think Samsung will do anything about this ever.

All the ""solutions"" that you can find on the internet impact on the HDR performance (lowering the overall backlight, enabling ECO, etc.)

I also have a Q6F and this is my only regret about this TV.

Ozark on Netflix is a great example of the poor handling of subtitles on HDR dark scenes.

If anyone has any trick that minimize this problem please share, I've tried the smallest possible subtitles on netflix/amazon prime, grey subtitles, yellow subtitles, semitransparency, nothing seems to help.",2018-12-05 02:44:44

193,193,"You should talk to another representative. I had a similar issue as yours when I tried to place my order not once, twice, but 3 times. The first time I hopped on that Black Fri/Cyber Mon deal. Chose to buy an unlocked Note 9 for $200 off and chose the Samsung financing option to pay for the phone. Little did I know the billing information has to match the shipping information or else they'll cancel your order. 

So my order status gets changed to cancel so I call customer support to call to find out what went wrong. They told me I had to call the financing company to change the billing address so that's what I did. Called TD Ameritrade on Sat &amp; used their automated prompt to change my billing address. 

Wait another 3 days until Tues thinking my order will finally process and get changed to shipped. Nope, Samsung cancels my order again because they say the address they have on file is still my old address and not the new one that TD Ameritrade has. 

They tell me to wait 7 business days (12/04) to see if anything updates on their end as the computer automatically generated the order so it might correct itself. I even check TD Ameritrade login with my online account &amp; it shows my NEW updated billing address. 

So I call Samsung again and ask if they will honor my 20% discount since it shows in their system I had 2 cancelled orders. The representative tells me I am able to add the unlocked Note 9 to my cart and once the order goes through they can credit me back the $200 in the form of a refund. Well little did I know that I am going to go through the same frustrating process again. 

Place my order for a 3rd time and their system STILL shows that my billing address and shipping address don't match. I am at my wit's end in trying to order a phone from them because they should be able to manually update their database for any changes in billing address since TD Ameritrade reflects the new address change. 

Called customer support explaining to them that I think my order is going to get cancelled again for a THIRD time because of their incompetence to comprehend what information I am trying to relay to them. If my order gets cancelled again I swear I am going to bombard all their social media accounts in regards to how poor their customer service is and that Apple would not lead me as the consumer into an endless cycle of processing to cancelled orders.

194,194,"Note 9 is very good, has everything you will ever need. It is just the camera is the downfall, but coming from an iPhone you won't notice much of a difference, note 9 and the new iPhone camera are kinda on the same level on average, it is only pixel and the Huawei is a level above every one else.

If camera isn't too big of a concern I suggest note 9. Presumably you will be better support because I don't know the situation of Huawei in your country but I would think Samsung is more accessible",2018-12-05 03:41:47

196,196,"Ebay is showing results for the screen around £180 - £220.

If your screen is broken then it's really really easy to fix. Heat the edges of the phone with a hair drier and use a guitar pick to run around the edges removing the glue from the phone. As you get all the way around the screen you lift it off slowly and disconnect the little tabs. Looks to be around 3 of them. One at the top, side and bottom. (Push in or pop off type connecters)

Put new screen in place, attach connectors and seal up with the pre applied sticky tape around the edges of the new screen.

Fixing the frame is another story. You will always have those dents but you will have a working screen.

If you have insurance then claim via that. Typically £60 excess if not repair it yourself. Just take your time as removing the screen for the first time might take you 10 minutes or more as you're super gentle. But you will get a feel for it.

So long story short test out everything is the price range that your are shooting for. Heck you may even end up with something from Google or LG. Personally I would try a pixel. May not have as many features but that silky smooth google os is tempting, plus actual timely updates.

The Turks were in Asia always. Turks are not Indian or Indians, not Turk.

Ottoman Empire was a Turkish country. Anatolian belongs the Turks. But also we lived in Asia for hundreds of years. Also, there are many Turkish countries in Asia at this time like Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan or Tatarstan. Asia does not belong only to China, India or Russia. Asia also belongs the Turk.

Nov 1 We received our second Galaxy Note 8, and shipped our second phone.

Nov 16 - Samsung received our second trade in.

Samsung still hasn't verified our second trade in. It's quite ridiculous at this point. It makes you think that they put a test Sim card into the phone, and use it for multiple weeks. I know it's a busy time of the year, but this is crazy. We ordered a S9 on a separate account on Black Friday, and we just received it. Be prepared to wait a while.

Google backup attempts to do some of these things but I have noticed it will not neccessarily backup all the corrects apps and text messages especially.

I can keep going and it doesn't have to end with just planes. there are lots of gory photos too. 

but Google it. you won't find this issue when audio jacks and power jacks weren't merged because audio jacks weren't capable of delivering this kind of voltage. you will find people getting static shocks etc from ipods incidentally 

people have been safely using audio jacks for about a hundred years in one form or another and there was no reason to eliminate them. apple started the trend because they are crazy patent licensing hawks 

the implication isn't that is was specifically Apple but that merging the audio jack and the power jack is a terrible idea as people already knew

I can charge another phone with my phone. the power jack is capable of driving way more power than is necessary to deliver audio but just enough to get your head to explode

if audio jacks were as much of a risk before you'd imagine 100+ watt power amps with audio jacks would be making lots of head lines. shoot TVs used to have audio jacks. TVs are such high voltage pieces of machinery that you can pick one up from the junkyard and punch your hand through one and die from the residual capacitance ",2018-12-08 19:15:22

316,316,"If AC 110/220V passed through your phone's internals it would fry anything and everything attached to it. Dongle or not. Most headphones jacks are placed on the same PCB as the charging port even on Samsung devices. 

The Audio adapter has a DAC, it draws a little bit of current from the battery and that's it. You aren't connecting your headphones to the power source directly. There is a very small chance for the dongle's circuitry to overheat and get fried, and even then, the 5V will not cause any damage to your ears let alone kill you. Apple just moved the entire circuitry outside the phone to make it a hassle and force people to buy their wireless accessories. So long as the damage is in the dongle and not the wall adapter. You are safe. 

TL;DR regardless of what phone you have, it is never a good idea to use it while charging because it could overheat ,short circuit and then ignite. Wearing earphones when this happens will be even more catastrophic.

I'm not shitting on Samsung phones, I still think they're the best phones available. But this is normal in most phones in order to reduce the overall size. Take a screwdriver to the charging port of an S9 or an iPhone X, nothing will happen. Because they are designed to survive short circuits.
Apple just moved part of that bottom board out of the phone. To ""save space""


The USB DAC (Dongle) isn't really software controlled, it uses the data lines for the audio signal and draws a couple of milliamps from the charging line. Can the DAC get overheated by drawing too much current? Yes. Is it likely? No. There is circuitry intended to limit current and the DAC itself will just get damaged and not work before it could harm you. People buying cheap dongles will, in the worst case scenario , have the entire 5V 2A pass to their headphones which will just damage the internal drivers and they would have to be replaced.

The only way it would be lethal is if you have a faulty adapter that wrongly sends the entire AC Voltage to your phone, at this point it does not matter if you have the headphone jack on a dongle, at the bottom of the phone or the top of the phone. Everything including your hands is going to get fried(if there is current flow).",2018-12-09 14:44:52

339,339,"Purchasing a Samsung phone off of eBay likely means it is an international model. There are several variants of the Note 9 specific to various regions and they all have different capabilities for accessing cellular networks (specifically, the bands and frequencies).

I am in Canada and purchased a dual-sim Note 9 from eBay, but since it is from a different region (Asia), it does not support all of the bands from my two carriers. Therefore I find that I only receive one or two bars, just like you, and slower download speeds. This isn't too big of a problem for me since I'm mostly on wifi doing internet-connected tasks rather than calls and SMS and I'm willing to put up with it because I need the dual-sim functionality, but this may cause significant issues if you rely on these basic features.

TL;DR international models of Samsung phones that were purchased online are not fully compatible with North American telco networks due to bands and frequencies. Either return and buy one locally, or if there's a specific reason why you got the international model (i.e. dual-SIM), just put up with it.",2018-12-09 21:38:33

However, I've had it since April '17 and I have been trying to look for excuses to upgrade for the past few months, and I've been failing.

One of the benefits of Android is your ability to customize nearly everything (Samsung themes), which I've done consistently to keep things fresh and exciting. I've been very happy with this phone and I think the Galaxy line is a consistently great line, you won't be disappointed. 

I'd recommend the S9 because it's slightly improved over my S8 (and it's current) and it'll age well. Or, save up and wait until next March for the release of the S10, which will probably have improved cameras.

377,377,"&gt;The headphone jack is still part of the circuitry, it's just not soldered on. This is to help with repairs. Still in case of a short circuit, it will pass the current through the headphone jack.
&gt;
&gt;I understand what you mean by  buffer, it is like having  a mini fuse built in. But my point is that the Dongle is literally moving the internal circuitry (DAC and Port) outside , the S9 also has a DAC built in the phone. 
&gt;The dongle to charging port interface is the same as the S9's daughter board to main board. 
&gt;
&gt;Is there any advantage to this? Sort of. There is a possibility of having a higher quality DAC and driving more demanding headphones (higher impedance). and audio will sound very similar across every device because the DAC is the same.  But you could do this on the S9 as well whilst keeping the headphone jack.
&gt;
&gt;The disadvantages are far more though, more wear on the port, more failure points (not lethal), can't listen to music without a dongle. Etc etc.
&gt;

sure granted some freak accident lightning strikes your house etc then it won't matter but having a thin gauge only enough to pass 3v between your phone and your audio jack is a good idea as is having an audio jack. if headphone cables were comprised of the same amount of metal I would bet there'd no how way for a lethal dose of electricity to pass through. 


and while you're right maybe offboard dacs could be better but doesn't that just pass the buck? if the industry got away with providing only the most baseline dac and then expected the consumer to pay to play Russian roulette with dongles they're still providing another unnecessary need for a point of failure.
 the s7 had don't have USB c. particularly the snapdragon one because was hated among audiophiles because it was both shouth and thin. the S8 however hadded a dedicated dac and sounds great in my opinion if not quite as loud as I'd want. 

we've reached similar to the late 90s with cd players that most are quite good with the only real limitation being volume which isn't really an issue for most people. 

all I see are dishonest reasons for why ""we"" benefit from the dropping of the headphone jack, the worst being that ""its out dated"" which is just a fox news style claim. 

""theres dongle for that"" slogan is anti consumer. the iPhone 7 added a spacer where the audio jack would have been that's ironically the same size and rough shape as an audio jack. it's literally plastic piece. 

the apple excuse never made sense. first they claimed it was to allow the device to be water resistant which was clearly ignoring innovation from other sources again. then it was about saving space which still doesn't seem to be probably given that there are devices smaller and thinner than the iPhone 7 that handle their audio jack fine. 

it's annoying how many times ever since Apple dropped theirs did the media claim that everyone else would copy them which is a cheap way to claim that Apple was being innovative and others needed to ""catch up"". for Apple it meant selling a lot more dongle. licenses and for the rest of us just meant a firewall between audio production and consumption.

all the reasons the people are told have been bullshit with the truth being something closer to ""they wanted save a few cents. they wanted to sell dongles with lightnkng port licensing etc. but the best way is still to allow people to have the option of the more reliable audio jack while still having the device capable of USB c audio as well as Bluetooth advancements . 

sure the dongle removed the charger from the phone so now the power is being handled by the dongle which also should in its best base scenario prevent the power from unloading through the audio port but I bet you these singles are likely hardwired to be cheap and compact rather than modular as the s9 is. 

the thing that would be at risk of burning our isn't even the phone anymore but the dongle which would explain why only one of the dbejfes one seen features a charred phone and that have been one ages ago. 

&gt;
&gt;Regardless of what phone you use, I guarantee you will suffer the same consequences if the charger decides to pass the AC Voltage through the cable.
&gt;

maybe it's shock my hand but I really doubt that tiny ribbon band would be capable of carrying enough current to cause someone's head to explode. if you grab some speaker voice cable and lie 4 side by side in ribbon formation you'll quickly burn the wires out if you try to send more than 9v over them. In tech you fan use they as an easy way to cut and toast bread at the same time.. 


if the ribbon cable managed to merge with the board and the board itself became conductive then yea you'd die. but all these little safe guards are useful. I don't see any reason why anyone would choose to follow Apples example at all. apple gains by licensing and drm protection with no more loop hole ports. 

android companies just seem to be doing it to copy Apple pressured by the audio industry to further lock down drm via an all digital audio output route. the drm thing doesn't make as much sense since you can easily download any file onto an android anyway. 

I have a Google pixel 2 dongle and it's dac is pretty bad so now it's just collecting dust. 

&gt;Now, if there is a short circuit in your cable itself and you are using an original charger, you will be safe because they are designed to handle worn cables that will inevitably have a short. This is what will happen with the lightning adapter in the worst case scenario. 

on a wing or a prayer. the audio jack is separated from the board by a very thin ribbon cable with small. copper connections. the lightning port is still a combination port capable of sending or receiving power just like the USB c port which on galaxies are also an option. 

you don't see too many people buying enhanced powered USB or lightning port headphones though so I'm starting to think that was never really an idea. 

&gt;
&gt;You will find many incidents of people in third world countries buying cheap Chinese adapters(Wall plug) and then getting their ears burnt along with their earphones after the adapter short circuits. And none of these were due to a faulty dongle, in fact most were even before 2016.

you can find isolated incidence about once every 2 or 3 years going back to it looks like 2014 but there has been a shocking rise in reports in 2018 alone and more on begween 2016 and 2018.

the flack Samsung gets for not following the ""new way"" is unethical and its a good thing that the audio jack which is the most versatile port there is being just a low-voltage unamplified version of the same copper connection that loud speakers a d musicians use. the audio jack is the last industrial grade jack and I hope the trend of trying to fall it obsolete dies before it causes more problems. 

while your headphones are plugged into your charging port don't you think it's a little scary that a piece of a malicious software could just switch the output to max? save guards be damned. where there's a will there's a way. 

a nice handy 3v output audio jack is great and I hope people are fooled into having it be dropped in favor of dongles. 

and granted I'm am biased. if the mediu continue to say this things like ""while Samsung still insists on featuring the audio jack"" ąs if well all be excited when we lose it. ",2018-12-11 06:55:56

390,390,"Do not buy the Tab S4. It is awful and has last gen specs. Samsung doesn't seem to care enough to even optimize the basic UI on it. Out of the box it is worse than a used Note 8 (with installed apps, files, etc). 

I hate Apple with a Passion but ended up getting the iPad Pro 10.5 with keyboard and Pencil, and I will never buy an Android tablet ever again. 
The UI, the apps, the battery life, everything is waaay better than Android Tablets. It just works. 

Sure there are some restrictions but I have managed to overcome just about every one of them. Let me know what you like in the Tab S3 and I'll let you know about how it can be done on the iPad.

395,395,"I have a Tab S4 and a Note 9 and I couldn't agree with your sentiment less. The SD835 isn't cutting edge but it's hardly last-gen, especially considering the launch S4's launch date. In the few months I've had the S4 I've had no issues with speed or ram management even when using DEX, and battery life is consistently over 10 hours of constant use or 25% a week on pure standby. Given that I purchased mine with a student discount I feel that the price to performance ratio is equivalent to the iPad Pro but with the benefit of running my preferred operating system. As for using the S4 alongside a Note 9, I don't see any lack of optimization nor any lapse in performance despite the ram and cpu differences. The only thing the Tab S4 is objectively worse at is taking pictures, and I'm not exactly losing sleep over it. 

All that being said, I wish Samsung could match the 120 hz refresh rate of the iPad Pro. I prefer a 60 hz OLED to a 120 hz LCD, but I'd love to have the best of both worlds in this regard. ",2018-12-11 15:57:56

405,405,"Unfortunately, Samsung does not have a global warranty particularly because of different processors being used in different regions. In this case, your phone has a snapdragon where in Asian countries the Exynos variant is used. The official Samsung repair center in Japan would not be able to repair your phone because when they open the device and if somehow they mess one of the circuits in the PBA (basically your motherboard of your phone) and if they can't replace the part like for like, it won't pass quality check. My advice would be to take it to a 3rd party repairer if its just the screen. Granted, they might not use original Samsung parts but it will do as a temporary fix. Having said that, 3rd party repairers can get really expensive because of the curved screen. Hope this helps. ",2018-12-12 04:07:19

Of course if Samsung screws up your repair, not only the manager will probably have a pay cut but also they will have to pay you lots of money to not get sued. Whereas is some 3rd party dude fried your motherboard, he probably just give you a new phone and tell you to GTFO, with all your information lost.

The fact that they cannot and not just in Japan but globally for devices bought in other regions indicates that there are challenges from a legal and infrastructural point of view. Also, yes displays are identical. Again, try to understand, what I'm trying to say is if they f*ck up your repair they can't replace your phone like for like just because they don't sell Snapdragon variants in Japan, and part of the quality check process is to make sure that the device repaired is like brand new otherwise that gives customers the chance to sue Samsung.

Don't think of Samsung as one company. Each country/geographic region has it's own Samsung  division that is essentially it's own company that is in turn owned by Samsung Group in Korea.

As such, each regional Samsung only stocks parts and can only service devices from it's own territory. 

Additionally, the S7 Edge has the charging board integrated into the screen assembly. This charging board has other hardware in it, including antenna connections. A board from Japan will only work with Japanese S7 Edge.

Finally on some models, there are slight differences in the main board and/or screen connector between carrier / regions. This means that a Japanese screen connector may not even align or connect to your main board.

We have these bins at work I like but had no idea what they were called and couldn't find them. Bixby figured out what they were and I bought some. :)

S-Health has a lot of features. It has a built in sensor to determine your heartrate and your oxygen levels. It's similar to the ones hospitals put on your fingers. They've had that feature since the S5.


Oh and Samsung Pay! It uses MST (and NFC) so I can pay almost everywhere. I can pay at places that don't even have the new machines compatible with wireless pay. You get points and rewards too for using it.

4,4,"Did you try wiping the cache partition through recovery? If not, please try this before giving in your phone for repair or firmware reflashing.

This is a method I found on the internet. Works the same way across almost all of today’s Android smartphones.

1) Hold the Power and Volume Down buttons when it is stuck.
2) When the screen turns off, immediately switch your grip to the Volume Up and Power buttons and hold.
3) Press and then hold the Home and Volume UP keys, then press and hold the Power key.
4) When the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge shows on the screen, release the Power key but continue holding the Home and Volume Up keys.
5) When the Android logo shows, you may release both keys and leave the phone be for about 30 to 60 seconds.
6) Using the Volume Down key, navigate through the options and highlight ‘wipe cache partition.’
7) Once highlighted, you may press the Power key to select it.
8) Now highlight the option ‘Yes’ using the Volume Down key and press the Power button to select it.
9) Wait until your phone is finished wiping the cache partition. Once completed, highlight ‘Reboot system now’ and press the Power key.

Now, leave your phone for a while as it will take longer than the usual time to finish booting, if this worked.

Can't do any of that with an iphone BUT the iphone is so much easier to do anything lol. The OS just feels smooth and tailored for ease of use.

44,44,"I got a galaxy book 12 for school that stopped powering consistently from what turned out to be a motherboard issue.  Despite being just out of warranty, Samsung covered the parts and labor to have the device serviced by Creative Vision Electronics.

CVE replaced the motherboard and data link, and ran QA diagnostics indicating the device was in complete working order on a service receipt.

Then I got that mess when I powered it on for the first time since receiving it 2 days ago, and it's only gotten worse.

Samsung phone support was on holiday until today.
Samsung online told me to contact CVE, which has not actually been available on calling, nor returned calls from leaving information.
UPS does not deal directly with the receiver in these matters.

I believe Samsung Care initiated a UPS claim today, but I've never been involved in this process before and don't know how the investigation works, or how they followup based on the findings.

It's been a huge pain and I had to amazon prime order a cheap laptop to use in the interim, but I'm hoping it'll be resolved.",2019-01-02 08:13:47

74,74,"No iMessage equivalent on Android, and Apple's customer service is second to none. That said, iMessage is becoming more of a legacy platform these days. It looks fancy but that was a few years before so many other options became available. Younger people don't do much with iMessage as of late. It is more of a gimmick than a killer feature.

As for Apple, the phones they sell are solid and they support updates for at least four years. The iPhone resale values are much better. The CPU is faster, sound from the speakers is better, and support for bluetooth headphones is better. Also, you can't beat the ecosystem. Everything really does work well together. Truth is, you won't be sorry with the switch to an iPhone. It is a terrific platform.

 If you want to stay with Android though, you won't be able to beat Samsung. I prefer Android for its customizability, expandable memory, and tons of options for available devices. Updates are terrific with Samsung as of late, and I love my s9+ for many reasons. 

Phones these days are so similar for the average user. If you just want something that works and don't want to spend 1000 to 1200 dollars on a phone, and if you've already spent money on apps from the Play Store, stick with Samsung. You can find an s9+ for about 600 dollars these days. That's about half what you'd pay for an equivalent model iPhone, and the differences aren't that much of a better value.

106,106,"One of my favorite but simple things is when you bring down the control panel and tap on the words instead of the icon it opens a mini menu right there in the control panel. A long press will take you to the full page.

 Most of the edge features are actual very useful it's just a matter of getting in the habit of using them. I recommend playing around with the various apps for it. 

Bixby is good as well,  but I recommend disabling the Bixby home button.  As accidental presses happen often,  but you will still have long press or  voice commands to access Bixby voice. Which works beautifully with other Samsung or smartthings devices. The smartthings hub is also extremely useful especially if you use Samsung accessories and devices. 

Good lock 2018 is a great app for Samsung devices as well. It adds tons of features. 



Lastly I recommend doing this with any phone but just go through all the various menus in the settings.  As it allows you to familiarize yourself with the devices stock features.",2019-01-03 14:35:31

For starters, Google has their own beef with the companies that won't allow them to simply port the Pixel experience on their devices (with the major fear of losing their Pixel juices).

But when your name is Samsung or LG, it ain't that easy behind the curtains.

Secondly, the amount of people who really want a completely dead stock experience is tiny. Yeah, it feels like everybody actually wants stock android when you're on a community where mostly these people find their way here/there.

Thirdly, people for some odd reason behave like Samsung just starts really late to build the OS and they just hold it for no reason.

205,205,"An awesome reason why Samsung Pay is WAAAAAAYYY better than all other forms of mobile payments: 

Samsung works on 90% of credit card readers because they use NFC in conjunction with MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission), which they legally own and no other phone company can use. MST emits a magnetic signal that simulates the magnetic strip found on the back of a credit or debit card, which is why Samsung Pay is superior. All other phones only use NFC, which only work on the new credit card readers that have NFC readers installed.

I love when I get to educate cashiers on this. Especially when they tell me ""We don't take Apple Pay"". Their reactions are the best when they realize how very wrong they were. 

I love Samsung Pay ❤

194,194,"An awesome reason why Samsung Pay is WAAAAAAYYY better than all other forms of mobile payments: 

Samsung works on 90% of credit card readers because they use NFC in conjunction with MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission), which they legally own and no other phone company can use. MST emits a magnetic signal that simulates the magnetic strip found on the back of a credit or debit card, which is why Samsung Pay is superior. All other phones only use NFC, which only work on the new credit card readers that have NFC readers installed.

My fingerprints are a bit less defined, through years of labor, I suppose, so the phone would often have trouble reading my prints.

I myself have the  NP880Z5E, but our models are similar enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

Optional step: install SSD, so worth it, my boot up is \~20sec now.

# Steps:

1. Reformat using Win10 boot from disk
2. Check windows update, restart if prompted

 

Step 3&amp;4: Install [Display Driver Uninstaller](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html) (might be better than uninstalling manually because removes all setup files)

**OR**: Run: devmgmt.**msc &gt;** Display adapters &gt; Uninstall

3. Uninstall device:  Intel HD 4000,  Delete driver software.  (no need to reset)

4. Uninstall device: AMD Radeon HD 8600/8700m

Note: after reading 40+ forums and threads online, I've been told to do 3 and 4 IN THAT ORDER

&amp;#x200B;

5.  Now Reset \[**Create Restore Point 2**: Uninstalled Display Drivers\] 

6. Install Microsoft Basic Display Adapter (instead of Intel HD 4000)

&gt;Right-click Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000  
&gt;  
&gt;Driver &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse Manually &gt; Let me pick   
&gt;  
&gt;\[**Create Restore Point**\] 

7. Install  [Samsung Easy Settings](https://drivers.softpedia.com/get/Other-DRIVERS-TOOLS/Samsung/Samsung-NP300E5C-Notebook-Easy-Settings-Software-1114-for-Windows-7.shtml) (1.1.1.4 seems to be the last update; no need to run on compatibility mode)

8.  Windows &gt; Display Settings: uncheck ""Change brightness automatically when lighting changes"" box 

9.  Test brightness using f2/f3 function keys

10. Create another Restore Point! So you don't need to do the drama I did!

I travel a lot internationally for work as well, it's a lot more reassuring to know that I don't have to worry about my PANs, PINs or actual cards getting stolen - and I've used Samsung Pay around the world.

I travel a lot internationally for work as well, it's a lot more reassuring to know that I don't have to worry about my PANs, PINs or actual cards getting stolen - and I've used Samsung Pay around the world.
In fact, the only times it hasn't worked, those are the times that I pay in cash, since it is an indication that the system the merchant is using is doing something wrong, and probably wouldn't pass PA-DSS validation. That is a huge red flag for me, personally. ",2019-01-07 11:52:53

293,293,"Nope, not anymore with Samsungs.

I know for a 100% fact that from Android 8, including the international S7 and upwards on XEU/BTU firmware, WiFi and VoLTE is included for all networks, in the software

Samsung decided to include all carrier/network support for VoLTE and WiFi calling on BTU/XEU - which can be flashed if the phone is network unlocked 

Have 2 S7's both on different networks and can swap Sims between phones and both have WiFi and VoLTE available as well as my S9.

My tests only go as far as the XEU/BTU firmware which can be flashed if the phone is network unlocked.

Where's your S8 originally from? Grab a Three PAYG sim, put it in and see if you get VoLTE calls.

To try out WiFi calls, let the SIM in the phone for a few minutes, make a call to it then put the phone on flight mode and turn WiFi on.

Make sure the WiFi calling setting is turned on first. You should get the WiFi call symbol at the top",2019-01-07 14:55:37

I find this part doesn't make a whole lot of sense though (nothing against you, just their policy doesn't make sense if this is true):

""samsung cant assure condition of device and assure no damage transferred in the process""

Do you mean Samsung can't be assured? Because why would any damage occur just because the phone transferred from one person's hands to another? I mean they only cover manufacturer defects anyways (not a cracked screen or whatever), so who owns the phone is irrelevant. Or do you mean the person who buys it used can't be assured of the device's condition or any damage? Again, warranty only covers manufacturer defects in the warranty period, so why would it matter?

Anyhow, how do they even know you are the original purchaser? Is it by receipt? So if you buy used and get the receipt from the seller, or give the phone as a gift with the receipt, wouldn't that be enough to claim warranty if needed?



That's so strange that Samsung ""can't assure condition of the device"" while Apple doesn't care if you're the 10th owner, as long as it's under warranty they'll fix it..... As a Samsung user that's pretty disappointing

I've always loved Android devices for having more freedom to choose and all my Samsung phones have had great performance (had this one for over 2 years and it feels as if it functions like new).

If this works I can stick with it but forced use of services/apps makes me want to switch.

I feel like the premium quality of the hardware which apple used to win hands down isnt an argument they can claim anymore. Samsungs S7 was almost there but not quite. The S8 and S9 and their note variants are absolute beautiful and premium feeling hardware. 

That being said iMessenger is the only thing i miss about iphone. and with good reason. when sending SMS the quality of images and videos are greatly reduced (if they even arrive at all.)  long texts are split up and arrive out of order sometimes (if the entire message even gets there at all) and interactive features in SMS are basically non existant. 

I make up for this but using facebook messenger as my default sms program and try to never sms anyone using it.  It took a year to get my old man on board with messaging me on facebook messenger rather than text.

91,91,"Personally I'd have made the same decision. I mean swiping up+press back vs one swipe to go back. I'd say that's an improvement and removal of what could be viewed as an unnecessary step. 
Also be because Android was never really intended to have that hide the navbar feature, and Android's new gesture based navbar likely broke that implementation. Samsung did say they are working on it to bring it back in a future update according to the beta feedback report summary. Remember that Samsung is just overlaying things on Android. If Google changes something on Android fundamentally and a Samsung function is sitting on that base, then that Samsung function stops working.
The navbar on Google never had that hide button IIRC. Samsung added that. Then Google straight up removed the navbar and replaced it with something different to accomodate gestures. This means the software underneath changed. It's not that easy to always retain legacy stuff, especially when the guys who make the base (Android) don't really seem to care about legacy stuff and expect people to keep up with them, and not bother to cater to those left behind.",2019-02-01 15:52:06
92,92,"I'm dealing with this right now.   Noticed the back panel coming separated from the frame on my S8 (14 months since purchase), and it smelled like nail polish remover, which as per my searches online was a clear battery problem.  I went to Samsung (Canada) support.  They indicated I should send it back to repair center for a free repair...  great.  

&amp;#x200B;

So I ship it to the repair center, they have it for a week, and today they email me saying the repair cost will be $624 after tax because they found corrosion in the phone (I assume water damage?).

&amp;#x200B;

Water couldn't have gotten into the phone if it wasn't bulging out the back panel in the first place.. but it still sounds like they won't honor the free repair.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife did say some water got splashed on the phone a couple weeks before I noticed the back panel was bulging out.. but the phone was performing just fine before and after that point, and right up to when i sent it in, it worked fine, I pulled a backup off it with no issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to get them to see the logic that it couldn't have possibly had any water damage if the back panel wasn't already bulging out, so the bulging battery broke the waterproofing seal, and then regular activities that wouldn't have caused water damage on the phone may have tripped some water sensors or caused some corrosion in the phone.. but to me that should be covered under warranty because the initial problem is the bulging battery which they said they would fix free of charge.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway.. just saying be careful sending things back to Samsung.  I'm hoping they'll change their mind on my repair and I can get my wife her phone back ASAP.. but right now it's not looking good.

Basically, Samsung waits for the carriers to certify that the update is working for their networks before pushing it. You don't want to get an update that suddenly doesn't allow you to use your phone as a phone right? So the unlocked won't be pushed until all carriers tell Samsung it's A-OK.

And that's why samsung needs to make that stupid looking hole in display so idiots like people I just described not going to say oh it's the same as before and even tho s9 look waaaay better they gonna buy this one cuz well look different and everybody knows that it is the latest model.. 

It sucks that people like that actually dictate the market rather than people that actually have style and don't mind keeping similar design until something truly futuristic and new is ready.. 

Like I would totally buy s10 if it just had bigger battery better software and slightly smaller bezels than s9.. This way I'm just gonna wait for either note 10 or not fucking buy this crap until they actually release something new..

I'm currently on note 8 and I'm perfectly fine with it.. I might get n9 in few months tbh bc id does have better battery and smaller bezels and if they gonna fuck up note 10 like this chances of me getting n9 instead of 10 are 100% .. 

They should really think about what the fuck are they doing.. First they fucked up they smartwatch line up (like why would you ditch so futuristic design of gear s that nobody else had to go for classic looking watch that is around for fucking hundreds of year just WTF?)

welcome to the galaxy of possibilities. REGARDLESS of early adopters or not, these i have found are helpful to some.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

​I have many others that require ADB minimal and fastboot, as in black navbar and more immersive screen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

​but thats for those who know precisely how know to use Adb.

&amp;#x200B;

​Faster animations -- Go on your Note 9 and go into the settings, enter developer options (if you don't know how to do this then click here ), next up just scroll down until you find Window animation scale, Transition animation scale and Animator duration scale. Default they are set on 1x, change them to 0.5x or even off if that suits you. After you have changed all of them, your device will feel a lot faster.✨

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Auto restart. Go on your Note 9 and go into settings, next go to Device Maintenance and tap the three dots in the top right corner and click on Auto restart. Turn on Auto restart and select your schedule and your phone will automatically reboot on your set time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Download YouTube Vanced, it's basically YouTube but a lot better. Videos can play in the background, no ads, supports 4k video quality if you enable it in the vanced settings and a lot more. Download it here or here from the official Vanced website. Also download MicroG to be able to log in to your YouTube account.✨

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A good launcher. If you prefer the default TouchWiz launcher, then kudos to you. If you want something else then download one of either, Nova Launcher, Action launcher, Evie launcher, Microsoft launcher or even a Pixel launcher from XDA apps.✨

Change your phone display resolution depending on what you are gonna do, personally I run the highest display setting which is 2960x1440 when watching movies, videos but when I play games I set it to the default resolution which is 2220x1080, perhaps you can go lower to 1480x720 if you have issues with frames when playing games but that should not be a problem on the Note 9.✨

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Turn off edge panels if you don't want it. I hate it, so I disabled it and you can do that too in the settings of your phone. Just search for edge panels in the settings and you can disable them.✨

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Enable blue light filter to put less strain to your eyes when using your device at night or when its dark outside. You can enable this or turn on a schedule in the display settings on your Note 9.

228,228,I'm still using my s8 plus and it's buttery smooth in the one ui beta. I'd recommend it because it's still getting one more year of updates and the price is right. Probably should wait for the s10 to release before getting any Samsung flagship tho.,2019-02-04 15:39:54
229,229,"Samsung phones are significantly cheaper and have a larger feature set IMO, I really like the feel of stock Android so I'm looking forward to this update. What region are you in and is your phone carrier locked or unlocked? ",2019-02-04 15:46:46
230,230,Yea that makes the most sense since there's an additional step in carriers adding their own software/ optimizations but carriers in the US pay to get timely updates to their customers so Samsung prioritizes them first sadly... 😭,2019-02-04 15:52:55
231,231,Yeah. Makes more sense when you said they pay Samsung but I still don't like it. It is sad.,2019-02-04 15:54:37

234,234,"Look into one UI, I think you might like it, most people think it's a nice upgrade. Samsung's Samsung Experience, although a step above TouchWiz, (the old UI standard, used since the first Galaxy up until about 2016) lots of people think is bloated/ generally inferior to stock Android. One UI has more of a stock Android feel to it, and is centered around one hand usability and seems more intuitive to use. 

All in all, the S9 is a fantastic phone across the board, and Samsung has the best screens in the biz, I'm sure it will be a great upgrade over your G5. ",2019-02-04 16:35:32

236,236,"Why are you insulting me, the initial release for the beta was March 7th for pixel devices.

Also maybe learn to spell ""Samsung"", or what a software ""image"" is before calling me an idiot. ",2019-02-04 16:51:07
237,237,Theres loads of different icon packs to download you can change the size of the icons too and loads of extra settings that Samsung experience wont let you do.

OnePlus OxygenOS

Same for apple with iOS

254,254,"3 recommendations for android (I presume you don't want to flash rom because if you did, everyphone is kind of the same):

1/ samsung galaxy s10 snapdragon 855 version (exynos version is a bit slower for games, still good overall). Coming in 3 weeks.

2/ oneplus 6/6t. Go with 6 if you really want 3.5mm jack (op6 has big notch and small battery 6h on screen time). Go with 6t if you prefer water drop notch, incredible battery life (up to 10h screen time) and charging speed (30m - 50%)

I prefer Oxygen OS over oneUI at the moment due to animation, smoothness, lock screen gestures (launch app or media control when you draw on lock screen). Also, oneplus pumps out update faster and more frequently than Samsung because they have much less devices.",2019-02-04 23:52:50

Samsung used to be the go to android brand with their Galaxy line, but now they have competition with Google Pixel and OnePlus for top brands to compete against for top spot of Android, and then have to try to compete against Apple. Apple can charge ridiculous amounts of money because they are the only ones using that software and iOS. Samsung cant justify their price. They have 3 cameras on the back where the Pixel has 1 and still takes better pictures in every aspect. Samsung doesn't have the most powerful phone anymore either because of Pixel being stuck android and having no bloatware. All samsung has now is the best screen which is only a technical win considering when comparing to other lines a normal user wont be able to tell the difference between a samsung screen and an LG or Motorola screen. Samsung has nothing anymore.

306,306,"You'll have the exact same issue on Huawei and LG phones, unless you buy models with an lcd screen like the g7 or the View 20. It's not samsung fault, its just how OLED panels work. There are ways to mitigate it like reducing screen brigbrightness, resolution or auto hiding elements like the adress bar, but at the end of the those are just compromises, and it's up to you to decide is you want a worry free experience that will inevitably lead to burn in.",2019-02-05 15:38:11
307,307,The notifications are bigger and chunkier for the purpose of replying easier directly from the notification panel samsung says. Damn that i don't reply from there ever they've made it look horrible i think although i do like how it's much easier for 1 hand operation not having to reach upto the top of the screen anymore in the system apps ,2019-02-05 15:41:06
308,308,Actually Samsung is the only OEM that test their unlocked phone software to work with all 4 of the big carriers in the US... That's why unlocked phones get updates last on their brand of unlocked phones,2019-02-05 16:25:47
309,309,"The Samsung chins are like 1mm (if that) bigger than iPhone chins, however iPhones have uniform bezels around so they look smaller, rather than on galaxy devices that have the infinity display... It's literally an illusion song that Samsung has massive chins. Also, why do people go on about Samsung chins and not iPhone side bezels?",2019-02-05 16:33:09
310,310,"I think I certainly grasp the pain of their current affordability, but I honestly don't think the prices have hurt adoption. With current installment and upgrade plans, I still see S8s, S9s, and Note 8/9s everywhere I go. And it just seems disingenuous to say that stock Android is superior to One UI or the Samsung Experience. Is it faster? Sure. You can't write off the fact that there's a huge market that actually likes Samsung software though. I personally go out of my way to use Samsung's apps, especially their Music Player, because a lot of my content is locally stored (shoutout to them for pushing the barriers of storage). It's a unique app experience that's well integrated with the very premium hardware they offer (Edge Display, Goodlock, One UI coloration, Adapt sound, Dolby Atmos). Why would I want a slightly faster version of Android when half baked gesture navigation I can enjoy Goodlock on an Oreo Note 8? With first and third party support (from apps like Swift Installer), I can very much make this phone mine, despite already enjoying the default, pricey Samsung experience.",2019-02-05 17:04:24

313,313,"I really want someone from samsung to see this if i calculate all the money ive spent on their products. Its more tha 10k$ in the past few years i even bought their laptop. I even have the latest tab s4, is the kind of service we have come to expect from them? If this is the future i really wish i went with some other brand even an apple product, how hard is it to make software updates all this money we spent just to be treated like we bought our phones from some little kiosk in the mall. I see people om youtube having it since november i understand its the beta but, people in europe got the update in January  that means a stable version exsists. Verizon got the update why not the unlocked version (the only people holding this back is samsung, there is no carrier that i need to worry about). I am literally  pissed off and regret all the money ive spent on these products but you know what at the end its the consumers that always loose they will continue to make billions while we just sit around waiting. Heres a loyal Samsung buyer thinking about switching if u can stay away from this brand they dont care about their customers. I bet they're just waiting to release it with the s10 just to make my s9 slower. They did that last year with my s8 and they did that the year before with the s7.",2019-02-05 18:59:17
314,314,SMH everyone needs to chill out... If you were smart and did your research before you bought and unlocked phone thinking you would get updates 1st your wrong. Samsung is actually the ONLY OEM to test their unlocked phone software to work with all the big 4 Carriers radio bands in the US and therefore their unlocked phones get updates LAST.... It's not that big of a deal... I tried warning everyone on the s9 sub... I'm especially laughing at the people who sideloaded the first version they seen on firmware.science and didn't even bother to look at how to do it or even download the right build for their carrier and bricked their phones 🤣🤣,2019-02-05 19:35:23
315,315,"Right? I went from a Google Pixel 2 XL to a Samsung S9 and adaptive battery is what I miss the most. I do have to give Samsung credit this time though, A month after announcing it's release a lot of carriers are already releasing the update. Good improvement lol",2019-02-05 19:47:33
316,316,"All these people saying ""I hate the icons"" when all you have to do is go to Settings&gt;Wallpapers and Themes&gt;Icons. I saw a few there that looked like the Samsung Oreo icons if you use the keyword Oreo (although icon and theme availability is regional dependent AFAIK).",2019-02-05 20:01:45
317,317,"Just backup your phone to your laptop, or samsung cloud if you're lazy. Then power off your phone. Now you'll need to press on the bixby button , volume up button and power button at the same time until you see the samsung logo, where you will need to release. Once that's done, use your volume buttons to scroll through the options in recovery mode. Choose the factory reset option then press on the power button. After factory resetting,  you just need to restore. ",2019-02-05 20:03:31
318,318,I know. I’m reiterating what the Samsung rep said.,2019-02-05 20:19:18
319,319,"Yes, it may not work as fast as the traditional one you are used to. I liked the hole punch design for cameras, and the speaker up top was small and not too noticeable,  but sounds great!

I work in the US and used the phone from a Samsung rep as well",2019-02-05 20:44:48
320,320,So then that sucks why would samsung do that? That doesnt sound like a good business practice the people that actually bought the phone directly from them get the updates last? That doesnt sound right to me anyways i knew what i was getting into its just that they keep promising dates and then delaying it. If the date said 20th feb i would have waited but saying its gonna come on the fourth and im here checking every few hours for it to come. They shouldnt make promises they cant keep. Ooh and btw my phone will never get bricked or anything i know how to fix phones i even sideloaded the one they had used it and took it off. I actually installed android on a pda2k(windows based)i hope that makes u understand that ive been doing this ever since android came out. ,2019-02-05 20:59:19
321,321,"I would love to buy a pixel if only it wasnt a POS that copies everything apple does. Let me tell why ill never buy a pixel
Heres a list:
1. Samsungs ui is better (edge screen functionality, one handed gestures, good lock 2018)
2. Headphone jack(bluetooth has lag idc what u think until this is fixed i want a headphone jack)
3. Fast charging out of the box
4. Akg headphones
5. Dolby atmos
6. More ram (6gb on my s9+)
7. No notch (another thing copied from apple and apple did it cuz of sophisticated technology. Why did google do it again?)
8. Samsung phones are beautiful and everyone is catching up to them always have always will
9. I have the google camera app on my phone with functional night mode i can link it to you if u want(it works better on samsung cameras)
10. Samsungs AMOLED technology (pixels always have display issues blue tint, red tint, even screen burn in) everyone buys screens from samsung, ones that dont suffer the problems i mentioned.
11. Resale people actually wanna buy a samsung phone, noone cares about pixels they already look like last years phones whenever they launched.

I mean i did say im pretty loyal to samsung this was just a rant im probably gonna buy the s10 on launch day or if i can get my hands on it before.",2019-02-05 21:11:20

323,323,"Here's a list to contradict your list:

1) Samsung doesn't even like their own TouchWiz.  They had to rebrand it to ""One UI"" AKA copying Google's Pixel Launcher.
2) Samsung isn't getting rid of the headphone jack mainly because they made a long term investment in AKG. If they remove the headphone jack it's most likely it'll take a hit.
3) AKG headphones included in the box are straight out garbage. FIRST THING I threw out in gladly paired my airpods which I have ZERO delay.
4) Fast charging is irrelevant when it comes to Google's Pixel since the battery lasts so much longer than Samsung devices.
5) Atmos was licensed most likely because Samsung still can't get sound right. Google doesn't need Atmos because they sound excellent .
6) Ram is irrelevant when the Operating system is optimized correctly. My Google Pixel 2 XL handled multitasking, heavy gaming and heavy ram based apps better than my Samsung S9 Plus.
7) Oddly enough the notch isn't as distracting as peopl claim it is. Either way Samsung is not releasing notch based devices copying Apple as well.
8) Samsung Devices are beautiful, but they break easily compared to others. Just ask search YouTube and you'll get your answer.
9) Samsung's camera is garbage compared to the  either the Google Pixel 3's or even the Google Pixel 2's camera. Go a head, download a modes version of it ... Samsung cannot even get that right.
10) Amoled screens are over saturated and off colored. I cannot believe the color red looks ORANGE.
11) I was able to sell my Google Pixel 2 XL a few weeks ago for $700 CND one year after purchasing it.
12) 2 Year warranty.
13) Monthly Security updates.
14) Monthly Bug Fixes.
15) First to get the latest version of Android.
16) Guaranteed 3 years of Android Software upgrades.
17) As long as you own a pixel, Unlimited 24/7 support with a 1-1 agent either through call, text, or email (they can even take over your screen without installing 3rd party apps).

You can always down vote the comment, but remember ... You stared this thread complaining. The only reason why I purchased a Samsung S9 plus was to lower my plan from $100 a month for 5G's of data to $65 for the exact same plan AND got a free S9 Plus put of it. Would I recommend anyone this phone? NOPE ... It's not a bad phone overall but there are better options out there lol",2019-02-05 21:41:13
324,324,"If you have the Exynos processor then you can roll back and stay on it forever by rooting the phone. There's no update notification.

If you have a Snapdragon processor, you can roll back if you have the ""US Unlocked"" model, but it will still notify you to update your software and you cannot make it go away. You may even accidentally... install it. It's very annoying. If you have a ""Carrier"" model, you may be out of lock because they may prevent you from downgrading to an older firmware.

[https://www.sammobile.com/firmwares/](https://www.sammobile.com/firmwares/) 

You should backup contacts, text messages, pictures, videos, documents, and etc by using **Samsung Smart Switch**. You can try to backup the apps, but it may fail to restore them. This doesn't back up app data like offline single player games. Only TWRP and Titanium backup root required apps can do that. Downgrading firmware may cause you to lose data.",2019-02-05 21:43:36
325,325,"That's awesome but samsung never gave an exact date for any of their phones to receive updates... Only the month they are scheduled to get them then it always says ""there is a possibility this schedule can change"".... The quote I pulled that I been seeing from them is this...... ""Unlike other OEMs, Samsung certifies unlocked updates on all four carriers, which leads to delays.""

326,326,"The answer to number one doesnt make sense. Ill show you what it sounds like: ooh wait google doesnt even like oreo anymore cuz they call the new one pie omg look what happened google doesnt even like pie anymore theyre calling it whatever its gonna be with Q. 
2. I dont care why, i don't care about how they have it, i said i like them because they have it what kind of answer is that ooh they only have it cuz of xyz. I said i like the phones because it has headphone jack. Whats soo contradicting in ur list?
3. Thats your opinion i think they work pretty good.
4. Just because u don't have something it becomes irrelevant anyways having it is a plus i dont get how u can justify not having it. Its like me cutting ur arm off and going like i did u a favor by getting u a prosthetic.
5. Again maybe u havent experienced it but atleast to me it sounds better than my friends iphones x and xr. If u say u have the s9+ go to youtube and watch this video called dolby atmos s9+ test watch it with the dolby mode on and then u can try it on a pixel you will see the difference.
6. I hope you are joking about this, maybe u havent seen the speed tests the pixel had the worst ram management last year. Every phone was better than it but hey for some reason to you having less ram is more appealing (its becoming a trend in your list: i dont have this but yea it doesnt matter, so mine is better?)
7. I dont buy budget phones and neither is the pixel a budget phone samsung introduced those in the budget category where it should stay. This just shows what samsung thinks about it. You can say its not distracting but its something in the way and there is no way it wont bother you while watching a video. And how much screen real estate do u loose if u dont crop to fit?
8. I use cases and really good quality screen protectors. All phones break the pixel will break so will a samsung so will an iphone. Its not like the pixel is special or built like a tank. But still i must add the oled on Samsung phones work even after dropping 10 times. You can watch the drop tests. Most phones dont survive 5. The designs are beautiful and that was my reason to buy it my phone should look the latest. I would have the oppo find x if it had the headphone jack.
9. Maybe you should go check out dxo mark scores samsung is always on top or atleast  top 5. All those top 10 cameras are fantastic there is no such thing as a bad camera on a flagship phone today. all i said was i have the google camera app so i have the best of both worlds. Dont see anything wrong with that.
10. That problem with over saturation can be solved unlike the pixel u can actually change screen modes on samsung. There is adaptive which it comes with out of the box but u can change it to basic problem solved.
11. Thats good for you i live in the states its different here
12. In all my years of owning samsung phones ive never needed the warranty the phones are built really well. But yea i agree on that, peace of mind is good and i would like that with samsung too didnt know they had that.
13. Mine gets those too every other month havent seen any changes to it. But they did add some features like the video wallpaper and slow motion to the s8. But monthly updates is why i started this thread and i agree thats something Samsung lacks. But i can tell you something u will never get ur headphone jack back through an update but samsung can add all those features through different softwares and stuff.
14,15,16. Good points and that is why i started this thread samsungs lack of software updates and its a problem they need to fix.

I have to add all these answers apply differently to different people maybe u like bluetooth headphones thats your choice, maybe i like my screen over saturated and you dont. There are somethings that u can get with different apps and softwares and then there are somethings u cant get like headphone jack and lack of a notch but again like i said u might  be able to accept a phone with a notch, i cant. When i wanna spend 800$+ on a phone i do alot of research those were my reasons to buy samsung because thats what appealed to me. ",2019-02-05 22:30:57

404,404,"God, that's a tough one lol.

I love(d) the pixel software until Pie, it really went to shit after that, so take that as my bias.

It's literally an upgrade to everything. A proper upgrade, compared to the Pixel 3 XL.

Geez, I guess I miss call screening when I briefly had it. Never really looked back though because the note is literally an upgrade to everything. The software is a bit overwhelming going from minimalist to max. embrace it though, it's an enjoyable experience if you desire to upgrade.

Sorry if that's a bit vague. Here's if I were to directly compare my note 9 to the OGXL.

Camera: I miss the simplicity of a point and shoot, no stupidity kinda deal with the Pixel. The note 9 though, is so much more modern. 4k60 is nuts, OIS &gt; EIS, portrait mode, etc. It's like it's from this century with features that are great. Pictures also instantly process. I know sometimes the XL can be stupid and take forever- yeah no that doesn't happen on the Note these days.

Battery: EASILY, the Note or S9. The battery kinda went to shit on the XL for me, but charged so much faster than the Note. I will honestly give it that. If I went to take a shower with the XL dead, it'd be at like 60% when I was done. Note on the other hand, more like 25-30. However, the Note can get me up to 8hrs SOT with 20 hours use, and over a day and a half if I don't abuse it. Not even a joke. My XL I'd only get 3-4. Not even a joke, like you'll see these typical battery pushers who leave the screen on all day, getting 6 on the pixel and whatever on the note, yeah no I'm talking practically here. The charge is worth the extra battery. 

Build: No questions here, the Note 9 absolutely destroys the pixel in terms of build. When I first used the Note, it actually blew me away with the screen size, and how more uniform and solid it feels. Not much to say, hold the phone and you'll understand why. Also you can use your phone in the rain so that's a bonus and wirelessly charge it, but that's basic knowledge.

Software: If you're worried about the horror stories of past where OEM skins literally destroyed Android, well I can say the specs caught up, and the note is lag free for the most part. Trust me, I came from an LG G4 before the XL. That phone was a disaster in terms of software and hardware. Obviously updates are going to take an eternity. One UI is trimmed, and a lot less disgusting than what tw was. People like Samsung for a reason.

I hope this helps! If there's any small questions you have, ask away.",2019-02-07 13:42:43

2,2,He mentions scrolling. Is it really that different on a Samsung compared to an iPhone?,2019-02-28 08:19:12
3,3,"A - Correct. That is why they offer them on the website.  


B - It depends.. The phone would need to be carrier unlocked. Since you're buying it from Samsung, I'm not sure if they sell them unlocked, or if you would request an unlock code from them, or if you would need to get one from your carrier, or if new phones even come carrier locked anymore..   


Also, with the S9 or S9+, you could flash different carrier roms to the phone using Samsung's Odin software, since the hardware for an S9 on sprint was the same as an S9 on At&amp;t. So I could take my Verizon branded phone, flash At&amp;t's firmware to it, and it wouldn't be any different than if I had purchased an At&amp;t phone, other than having Verizon's name physically printed on the device.  


However, not all phones have identical hardware and the modem chip in those phones can only work with certain frequency bands. Meaning that a phone that may work on GSM wouldn't work on CDMA, or vice-versa.   


I believe all Qualcomm chips are physically capable of working on all bands, since it's only the firmware that governs the functionality, but I don't know if all the same rules apply to the S10. I read that somsung added some security that blocks Odin now. Only time will tell if the community gets around it, and if the system images are interchangeable still. As well as which devices, if any, are carrier locked and who unlocks them. Most carriers require you use the device on their network for a period of time before they allow you to unlock it. But again, I have no idea how it all works when purchasing through samsung, or with the S10",2019-02-28 08:25:43

&amp;#x200B;

"" I have checked with my resources and see that we have received a sam sm-g930t as trade in device instead of galaxy S7.""

&amp;#x200B;

I burst out laughing at this.  After calmly explaining to them that a sm-g930t IS a galaxy S7, and linking the samsung product page, the rep told me that this will be moved to a different team and I should receive my trade in credit in 4 days.  Fingers crossed.

I sync  notes with Google keep notes and photos with Google photos. IMessage allows you to add Google photos to the app drawer in the message window that way you can still send photos taken with your Samsung phone to your iMessage groups (this requires wifi of course). It's doable. Just gotta ask yourself if what you gain is better than what you lose. I personally did it just so I don't always stay stuck in apple and Ill never know what it's like if I didn't try to leave. It's 2019 though both phones are great, there's no right or wrong answer.

72,72,"I switched from an iPhone to Galaxy S8 when the S8 came out. I love the customization options. You don't like the stock launcher download a new one and customize the shit out of it. Currently I blacked out my background and have all my app icons as white line art. I recently heard the saying, ""IOS treats you as a user, but Android treats you as the admin."" It couldn't be more true. 

All the customization is fairly simple to learn with a few youtube videos, the exception in a way is Tasker. Tasker is basically phone automation. For example, I set mine us so if my phone is vertical (In my car vent holder), plugged in to charge(Always plug my phone in in my car), has an audio cable connected(AUX cable in my car), and the phones GPS detects speeds greater than XYmph then I launch a weblink that opens spotify on my phone and plays Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins. I couldn't even dream of this amount of customization on IOS, you can't even put your apps where you want. 

I was huge into IOS around IOS 8-9, watching every rumor and every video. But I switched and after about a week of difficulty it became smoother than IOS ever was. You may be deep into the ecosystem, but you can run a lot of stuff on android, even apple music. I won't lie if you use the iCloud and some other Apple functionalities daily you may miss them.

111,111,I was able to contact samsung. I want to do samsung financing so was adamant on fixing it. They just recommended to use a new credit card. See how that works. I really upset because the prism white was all sold out which I preordered and now its unavailable to me. Gonna check if i can do something about that,2019-02-28 20:16:41

Normal battery drain happens very, very gradually over more than just two years. 

If you notice your battery suddenly does this, it means it's software related. 95% of the time it's from ""updates"" which I believe are intended to drain your battery so you buy the new Galaxy.

Notice Samsung phones are notorious for lag and battery problems after two years exactly. Samsung has an extensive history for shady business practices. I'll be getting a Pixel 4 as long as it's not ugly.

I also have the Pixel 2XL and I was in the same boat. However, there are two things that made me pull the trigger.


 For one Samsung's hardware is top of the line. And even after holding the S10e in my hand I looked at my Pixel 2XL in a different way, it feels cheapish (could just be me). 


The other thing is that you can tell Samsung is actually trying again. This lineup is not some little upgrade from last year, it's huge. It's actually innovative and that makes me excited about Samsung again.

Aside from the S-pen, functionally the Galaxy S series and note series are pretty identical.

In the US, how is it that the S series have been updated by the big 4 carriers, and yet the note 9 is still on Oreo on Verizon and TMobile? Not only is my TMobile note 9 phone 2 months behind on security updates, it still hasn't officially received Android Pie.

Oke then I am going to get that Iphone they are offering right now"" Samsung literally would lose billions if they would do it. I think that Deutsche Telekom is the parent company of T-Mobile.

263,263,I'm moving from pixel phone to the s10 and this got me thinking. So I installed Samsung internet and sure enough you're right. Working perfectly with Chrome though. I'll do some research and if I discover anything useful I'll let you know. ,2019-03-01 15:27:27
264,264,"I switch every couple of years between Samsung and Apple and I can tell you this: there's nothing wrong with trying something different. I never noticed any slowdown over time with any of my Samsung phones. I've had them all the way back to the Samsung Instinct and up to the S8+. As far as the camera, you can download apps to ""tweak"" the camera to your liking and see if that makes a difference. When I get my S10+, I'm going to insta the Google camera and use it instead of Samsung's software. I currently use it on my Razer Phone 2 and I haven't taken any pics with my iPhone X in a few months. 

I'll say this, depending on what you do with your iPhone, Android has an app for that. The only thing you won't have is iMessage and FaceTime. I say go for it. ",2019-03-01 15:32:18

2. Security is pretty tight with Knox and some features like app lockdowns etc. Remember, Android is open unlike Apple. Stray from unknown non Play-store apps, you’ll be fine. 

3. Latest camera to market usually shows improvements, especially Samsung having three on back but the gap between Apples best and Samsungs best is often subjective based on what result the end user likes.

I’ve just preordered my very first Android device (S10+) and it’s honestly the first time in probably 4-5 years I’ve been genuinely excited about a new phone.

281,281,"Honestly it's pretty good. I never have an issue where I run out of battery life, and I would rate myself as a 7/10 in terms of phone usage. The fast charge is great as well. The only thing I miss is wireless charging. No headphone jack, but I use wireless headphones anyways, so that doesn't bother me. Screen is pretty nice, but not Samsung nice. I think the teardrop ""notch"" is the best looking notch on any phone. And indisplay fingerprint reader works 95% of the time, but moisture can cause misreads. It is annoying at night that the brightness has to be full blast when it scans because it's an optical scanner, but I've to come to accept this quirk. Performance is great, plenty of RAM and internal storage is enough for me. Camera gets the job done. UI is my favorite out of any Android phone. All in all, very satisfied with this phone, and I sleep better at night knowing that I paid less than $600 for this phone. I've actually decided to hang onto this phone instead of upgrading. It works for me and has most of the features I desire. Hope this helps.",2019-03-01 17:53:03
282,282,"I would suggest the S8 at least purely due to the battery. After the Note 7 debacle, Samsung has massively improved battery degradation on their phones. Sure the S7 Edge might have a larger capacity right now, but it'll degrade fast enough that you might just hate it.",2019-03-01 17:55:52

Make one on an app. Want something that’s like Apple Pay but works almost anywhere ? Use Samsung Pay.

290,290,"1) Samsung Flow unfortunately has terrible connection with both Bluetooth and WiFi.
2) You cannot use WhatsApp for most features that Pushbullet offers (file transfer/ remote access of device from phone/ universal copy and paste between all devices/ a bunch of other features)
3) Pushbullet works in most browsers as well as an add-on and does not need to be downloaded to your computer.

Frankly it depends on what you use it for, but if all you do is want messaging from your computer you can switch from SMS to WhatsApp if that's what you would like to do. If you want to retain communicating via SMS then Pushbullet or Samsung Flow may be the best option. Again, in my opinion Flow is horrendous at a seamless transition from phone to PC as you need Bluetooth on for it to work.

To clarify: I do not have a Pushbullet pro subscription. I use their free features. ",2019-03-01 18:30:43

The S10+ uses 25-28% more power at max-min brightness compared to the S10e, but the battery is 36% bigger.  Idle power draw is the same.

Another thing to keep in mind is Software Updates. Samsung only pledged to keep releasing updates for 2 major Android OS releases.. After that, we are all left afloat in the ocean with just irregular security updates..",2019-03-02 00:32:36

336,336,"there are a number of manufacturers who make usb-c to usb-c certified cables.

You don't say which country you are in, which matters when it comes to seller suggestions, and mains socket pin format/voltage.

I personally favour Anker who make excellent quality 3rd party accessories. They do the cable below, which would probably be the one I'd go for at £10. 

There are cheaper alternatives, even an AmazonBasics one for £6.99 but if it were me, I would spend the extra for the better quality.

You've plenty of choice on Amazon when it comes to AC wall chargers, from those which provide both usb-A and usb-c, to others which provide multiple  output charging sockets (most of which are usually usb-A).

I would personally use a phone manufacturer supplied power brick, e.g. Samsung original, with a type A to type C cable, but I see that this Klearlook one has both, gets good reviews and is reasonably cheap (but they're an unknown brand to me)

Samsung loves to make photos 'pop' by exaggerating certain colours (making the sea/sky look more blue than green etc.).

Not only that: you can also use external microphones or headphones with your jack while you can charge your phone!

And its true. The comapnies remove the jack to sell their 5000$ wireless buds. But unfortunately Samsung will remove the jack too although the jack will not save any space in the phone. Why? Because the 3.5mm is as big as the USB C connector.",2019-03-02 06:08:27

2.) a $50 credit towards any accessories purchased through Samsung.

I use noise cancelling headphones and people are like you should get wireless ones. No the mic gets to much feedback so I use a wired one for quality.

Not even the upgrade thing where you get a new phone every 2 years, just the simple payment plan. But when I clicked it, it asked for my yearly income and what I pay a month in housing. So I put the info in which looked bad cause im at home at the moment and obviously didnt pass. Like what the fuck Samsung, I'm trying to give you my money!

You can do so much more on Android and it's not a closed in jail like iOS is, which makes it very boring in the end. There's just nothing customisable for example, resulting in everyone's phone (homescreen) looking the same if not identical.

I recently went back to android after trying iOS for a year and hated it. Waited patiently for the note 9 to drop and couldn't get back fast enough. IMO the note series is just a more polished S series phone with a S-Pen.",2019-03-02 16:11:36

479,479,"Although Samsung are pretty bad at timely updates, this is a complete overexaggeration. 

I've had a mid range Samsung for almost 2 years now and I've got security updates every 3 months at least. So yeah, it took a little longer to get the ""BIG"" shiny new Nougat/Oreo when it came around, but it was worth the wait in the end and the changes were actually extremely miniscule.

I'm now stuck with Oreo, I won't get Pie, and you know what, I'm happy with it... I honestly don't think I like the look of Pie and I'm not sure I want the changes... I've already had 2 big updates (Nougat/Oreo) and I'm continuing to get security support as promised, and I didn't even buy a flagship. 

People should be aware that Samsung are NOT the quickest to update, yes, but people should also be aware that they already have most of their software down now, and changes are generally small between each iteration anyway, so not having the latest isn't as big an issue as it would be on iOS.

Even then, having the new software first is never a good idea, everyone knows it takes a few months to properly iron out the main problems.",2019-03-02 19:05:12

488,488,"My last internet research showed that the flagship phones from both Apple and Samsung cost $1000 out of pocket.  Of course, they try to hide this behind ""trade in"" and ""pay per month"" pricing.  Fk 'em both for just hiding what their phones actually cost. But it sounds like they're both about the same.

489,489,"Yep - Got an email this afternoon that my S10+ order had been cancelled.  Tried to pre-order again, but the AT&amp;T side actually appeared to have somewhat processed my S10+ order and therefore said that I need to pay off the remaining balance of the phone in order to be eligible for an upgrade.  Talked to the AT&amp;T customer service and they kept assuring me that everything on their end showed my order as pending.  I explained that everything on the Samsung side said cancelled.  I asked who the phone came from, and they said direct from Samsung, so then I said if it's cancelled on the Samsung side, seems like I wouldn't be getting a phone and potentially missing out on a $550 trade in and $130 eCertificate now.  AT&amp;T trade is is $200 and you get a $100 Visa Gift Card.  


After 3 people and a supervisor, my line now shows as eligible for upgrade on the AT&amp;T site, but if I try to pre-order through Samsung it still shows up saying that I need to pay off the S10+ before I can upgrade...ugh...Hopefully by tomorrow morning the AT&amp;T and Samsung systems will sync and I can redo my pre-order.  I pre-ordered during the unveiling and now I'm a bit annoyed that I wont get the buds with my order and that I have to wait an additional week or two for the phone assuming this all gets sorted out.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first time pre-ordering a Samsung phone and I'm not overly impressed thus far.  Would have bee nice to get some sort of 'we're having troubles processing your order, please call support at XXX-XXX-XXXX to avoid further delays or cancellation'...versus a flat out cancellation, call your carrier email.",2019-03-02 20:51:24

492,492,"Hey all, this happened to me also, I'm super pissed. I pre-ordered on Feb 23rd to wake up this morning (on the eve of the phone release practically) to find out the order was cancelled. I also noticed that the galaxy buds that were supposed to come with our order are sold out, which isn't a huge deal, but it the principle that we deserve what we ordered for first as opposed to $130 Credit. I was intent on financing via my carrier through Samsung as the better promo and trade-in deal was only offered there, I called Samsung twice as well as Verizon, and finally spoke to a samsung rep that informed me that this is a widespread issue that was a mistake at the hands of Samsung and they are going to reach back out to me when the problem has been rectified. 

I say all that to say this:

Don't settle for these lame azz deals through your carrier or reorder the phone, Samsung is aware of this issue by now and they basically have been making notes of every account and sending it to tech as these cancellations were made without purpose and is some widespread error, and Samsung is assuring me that I will get my order this Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

When I purchased, I read all of the Terms and Conditions, it never said Samsung had to right to cancel orders without specific purpose. I'm gonna re read the terms and conditions and if they cancelled our orders outside the terms of their policies, I would suggest we all file a class action lawsuit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not that upset over the buds, or the phone thing, I'm more upset at the principle of the matter and these big companies not having good customer service as they're so big that they cannot be held accountable due to the sheer number of orders. I'm sick of that.

I thought customizability was something I wasn't going to use because I didn't care about different fonts or icon styles. But it is SOOO much more than that. I am really happy that I can do what I want with my phone.

Plus, (personal opinion) I like to be on the cutting edge of technology and I feel that Samsung is really trying to give that to the consumer.

I was having BT connection issues since the last iOS update. I was also having Pocket Casts and Audible randomly closing on me, so my overall experience with the S10+ is better. It is lighter in weight, the screens are about the same, the under screen fingerprint sensor is not as good as face unlock but Android has lots of options to keep the phone unlocked when in range of the watch, BT headphones etc. I have always used Google services a lot which probably helps the transition.

S10 offers so many ways to unlock the phone, so the flaw in face unlock is not detrimental to the unlocking security. If S10 was like the iPhones and was stripped of all other unlocking security features such as fingerprint sensor, then I'd take your comment more seriously. No one will use the face unlock in favor of the fingerprint sensor, anyways. 

Also, when you are just generally talking about the security on S10 being poor, you should be talking about the overall security of the phone. Unfortunately for you, Samsung phones with Knox are more secure than iPhones and other Android devices.

26,26,"I switched from an X and AW4 to S10+ and Galaxy Watch a bit over a week ago. No regrets at all so far. Been with Apple since the 3G, with a few visits to Android, but never stayed more than a few months, because I couldn't help myself when something new came along. Now I have a mortgage and other debts I can't afford to chop and change phones every 6 months anymore. The leaks for what the next iPhone will look like have put me off wanting one too, so there shouldn't be any temptation to go back this year either.

Things are a lot better now with the software so I'm going to stick it out. App quality has improved too in recent years from what I've seen. Bit of a learning curve with all the extra things you can do with the phone settings, but worth the time to get the hang of it.

The finger print scanner works about 98% of the time for me. Still waiting on the latest firmware update that apparently improves things. when it works I'd say it's on par with Face ID for unlock speed, maybe slightly behind, but you're not going to notice unless you're doing side by side comparisons. Still using my airpods and they work great, but I will be getting a set of the Samsung buds sometime soon.

I used keychain for my passwords, and luckily I still have an iPad, and MacBook Pro, so I can access my passwords if I can't remember any. Just have to find the best option for saving them with this phone (Samsung, Google, or 3rd party).

I'm now waiting for my telco to get the S10 5G so I can get my free upgrade. I'll miss the nice look of the ceramic black, seeing as silver and gold are the only two options that will be available here.

47,47,"Howdy y'all. 

My wife and I bought the S10 and S10+ respectively a few weeks ago. We both decided to use the trade-in program with our old Galaxy phones. 

Due to a understandable but frustrating limitation in the program, her new phone had to be delivered and her trade-in has to be processed before they will ship my new phone to me. 

Her trade in was sent out and delivered to Samsung on 2/22. We haven't received any news from Samsung on the status. 

Does anyone have experience with this program? How long should I expect this process to take?

Thanks for you help!",2019-03-31 15:06:21
48,48,"Reuters: Apple Inc. (APPL) recently announced that they are in ""co-operative talks"" with Samsung and various Ebay sellers in an effort to bring a wireless charger to market. 

An Apple press release states: ""Wireless chargers have proven to be more difficult than we imagined.   Being able to sell a $50 charger for $200, whilst suppressing a ""laughing all the way to the bank"" grin has been very challenging. Slapping an Apple logo on it doubles the price, but even Tim couldn't justify quadrupling the price.""

Apple has now shelved plans for the charger and are working on less strenuous tasks, such as building a self driving car. ",2019-03-31 15:25:19
49,49,I did it and I won't do it again. It's not like I think Samsung products are bad and I think Android is the better phone. I like Apples ecosystem much more. I'm a fan of connected products if you are too I don't recommend switching. ,2019-03-31 15:30:37

128,128,"Okay, I had to double check and correct myself, but it seems as though the firmware version was a G950US version. It was released in March 2018. I flashed that firmware. My hope was to flash a firmware version that would work and not lock the boot loader. When it flashed correctly I was surprised. There was an exploit that lets you get to the contacts app from the emergency services during the wizard set up.

I managed to use that method (without a sim card some how) and get to the contacts app. From there you can send messages (or try to) and send links to apps. If you go to a YouTube link it will open the YouTube app. Surprisingly in the terms and services section of the YouTube app you will open the terms in a web browser. If you have access to the web browser you have access to APK files. By default my firmware was only opening the Samsung Internet app. However luckily Firefox has an APK. Installing the Firefox APK gave me access to changing my default browser to none other than the Google Chrome browser from there I downloaded a third party apk app that was designed to give you the option to access any app on the phone without being on the Galaxy's main UI. So I went to the settings app cleared and turned off cloud storage syncing to the original account which no one including my buddy even knew about. I disabled Google Play services and added a brand new Google account and rebooted this made the install wizard just push on through thinking the new Google account was the admin account.

Some issues I ran into: in order to access emergency calling you need a connection to towers unless that direct emergency call is to 911. Which I didn't want to make our 911 services freak out so I called and told them it was a test call and it was. Problem I had was that the phones sim tray was non existent. So a buddy lended me his tray and I used my personal Verizon sim. This actually caused my account to be locked as the device's IMEI was black listed. So I had to go to Verizon and have my account fixed. So this created the issue of ""if I try to do this again I can't use my personal sim so how will I access emergency services again? For some odd reason the phone let me do so without a SIM card.

Here is where things get odd. Without the firmware version I got the phone actually would crash the wizard install app constantly. I got a tad discouraged thinking this meant that the phones current firmware version was designed to patch the exploit. So u actually reset the phone and for some reason it knew the Google account I added was there and the wizard install app decided to push on through to the ""add a Gmail account portion."" The next issue I had was it would read the Gmail but it wouldn't actually go anywhere. Instead it would say ""adding an account"" but just loop back around to add the account again. So once more I found myself stuck. That is when I decided to try all over again but this time with the older firmware version and entirely knew Gmail account. After a reboot and some hassle it just worked after reboot. Went on through no loops no crashing it just worked.",2019-04-01 20:44:10

Also, the audio only mode doesnt work(it still plays video). Everything works fine when I turn off the bluetooth.

BOE's screen technology (LCD and OLED) came from a Korean company that apparently went bankrupt. Aside from that, Chinese giant corporations are continuously poaching hundreds if not thousands of Korean engineers to help them catch up to the Korean standards when it comes to screens and semi-conductors.

I'm not sure exactly what the complaint is here? I believe what you've bought is or is similar to the Wireless Charger Duo, where the smaller wireless spot mimics the Galaxy Watch charging dock. 

The duo can charge any two Qi compatible devices at the same time. If you were to charge your watch, you have to use the dock part for the watch.

208,208,"the complain is in the title: the watch is not compatible with charge qi (that is bloody stupid since qi is the standard and since even Samsung rep does not know this)  


The duo charger has 2 charging pads(you don't say). the left one can charge ANY qi device up to 12W. the right one can charge ANY qi device up to 9W AND the galaxy watch. does not require a big effort to understand that, if they specified this, it means that the watch is NOT compatible with QI.

Samsung (the producer) is selling a charger with 2 pads. both pads are compatible with qi device but only one is compatible with the watch.  
We asked ourselves if the reason could be the coils' size, but it is not since: quoting you  


""""  there are multiple coils in the larger pad. They overlap which in turn helps the smaller coil get a connection. """"  


So, why is Samsung (the producer again) asking us not to recharge the watch on this pad? maybe because it is not compatible or not fully compatible with the charge qi standard?

Samsung wants you to use the designated pad for the watch because it has a smaller coil properly sized for the watch to get a GOOD and EFFICIENT connection.

1. Is there still a way to do split screen? If so I can't find it after the update.
2. Samsung has removed the ability to completely disable the Bixby button. I chatted with tech support online and they said something odd about the next update. Is the option coming back in the next update?
3. I have gotten the No Sim error for the entire time I've owned this phone. It's highly annoying and now it's back in force, requiring a restart every day. Is there any solution? 
4. If I don't make calls for a few days and then make a call it won't connect. I have to restart the phone and then the calls goes through immediately. This has gone on for the entire 13 months I've owned the phone. Is this common?

268,268,"I'll try to explain it better:

If you look at the watch charger it will say it outputs 5V which is the voltage needed for ""standard"" wireless charge like Samsung calls it.

Qi chargers can output 5W @5V 9W @9V 15W @12V.

Now, if you put a galaxy phone on the qi charger and manually disable the fast wireless charge it will negotiate the 5V profile with the charger. If you leave fast charge enable it will negotiate the 9V profile with the charger.

If you put the watch on the qi charger it will start charging with the 9V profile WHICH IS NOT THE RIGHT PROFILE. So, I'm afraid the watch cannot negotiate the right qi profile when put on a generic qi charger, thus requiring a precise charger.

You can post all the coil images you want but the watch works flawlessly on bigger coil, it simply can't negotiate the right charging profile from what I see.

302,302,"tl;dr: Why am I not getting audio from my 4k upscaling Blu-ray player?

Yesterday I received a refurbished Samsung BD-JM63 Blu-ray player with 4K upscaling. I plugged it into my TV (a Samsung NU6900 55"" UHD TV) with an old HDMI cable that I dug out of a box in the garage, and went through the player's setup (which included a firmware update). 

At no point could I get any sound from the player -- I attempted playing several Blu-rays and a couple of DVDs, and while I could see the image just fine, there was no audio. Tried a CD too, and never heard anything.

I fiddled with the player's audio settings (PCM vs. bitstream, etc.), but no sound. Tried the TV's HDMI 1 and HDMI 2 ports, power-cycled everything more than once, ran a factory reset on the player -- no dice.

I plugged the player into a cheapo Element HDTV and had the same issue.

I have not tried the player's optical out yet, mostly because I'd prefer not to use it (and because I don't have an optical cable sitting around at the moment).

More importantly, I'm almost certain that I'm using a 10-year-old HDMI cable, and I'm almost positive that I don't have a newer high-speed / premium / 2.x HDMI cable handy. I'm wondering whether this could be the issue -- that older cables just won't work with this model, even when attempting to play something as low-bandwidth as a DVD or CD. What are the odds that an HDMI 2.0 cable is all I need? Or did I just end up with an unrefurbed refurb?",2019-04-04 07:17:58

This is for the US only. 
Updates for the Samsung S8 and MAYBE the S9 on SPRINT are causing said phones to not receive web based data on their cellular Network.  The update hit the phones, I believe,  on April 1st.  There is currently NO solution for the S8 my Sprint rep says that  Sprint and Samsung are working on a solution but no ETA is available.  Sprint wellll release a patch for the issue as soon as they can. 

Don't go to the Sprint store, fix it shops or Samsung  shops as they have no solution .

Plus they didn't do any promotions like what Samsung does where you can get the newest flagship for hundreds less than msrp right on release. It should've been priced $100 to $200 less. People who mention the pixel always talk about the camera, besides that, there wasn't anything groundbreaking or special.

I backed up my internet through Samsung and my bookmarks are back. (I independently saved the addresses of my bookmark, just incase. I also saved my quick access links. They both were gone when I first reopened the app. So I re pinned my quick access sites. Later on when I went to do the bookmarks they were back in place.) Almost everything is back to the way it was except for that video bubble on the right side that gave you options to pop up video, etc. The bubble on the left for night mode etc is back. The layout of menu, home, etc is the old way. Most importantly video player is as it was. Hope this helps.

PS- I am irate at Samsung.",2019-04-05 06:36:26

I have a stock Samsung J700T, and two stock batteries. I just popped out one full battery and plugged in my spare to charge it. It read 0%, which I thought was odd. I swapped back to the original (full) battery. 0%. The phone now appears to be taking a very long time to ""charge"", as the original battery currently reads 2% despite the fact that I know it to be full.

Any way to clear the phone's memory of what it thinks the battery is at? If I turn it on with 1-2% battery it very quickly shuts off. Again, this battery is actually full.",2019-04-05 08:01:29

The problems even persisted after an RMA. The only feature I really miss on my S10e is calling screening. Other than that the screen is way superb, video/audio is better, calls work, apps don't close, GCam was ported and SD Card slot.

The are a few arguments here, one being that maybe Samsung should have advertised it here but on the other (and I agree with this side) the people that care about 5g and the technologies associated with it probably watched the event or at least pay attention to many of the outlets associated with it. 5g is far from mainstream and unless you live in one of the few areas that might have and have the money to burn this phone is not worth it. I used to work retail electronics and if I had to imagine your typical old person coming looking for a nice phone I would recommend the s10e all day long without a doubt. I love that Samsung is still innovating but just like in the day of the s5 when it could read your eyes to scroll the page, the high-end features that these phones are usually years ahead of the crowd, assuming they aren't just one and done feature just like what the s5's eye scrolling.

For me it's more the specs the bigger screen specifically. Not that big of a deal like I said. This is my first Samsung phone from the Smart phone generation. Can't say I'll ever go back to apple. The A50(think that's what it's called) would from design would have been better for me as I don't use a selfie camera and would love a full screen.  Don't know the specs on that one. I almost got the note 8 before I got my iPhone 7+ regret that decision after getting the his phone. If the note 10 has lots of improvements I'll probably upgrade or do so when the note 11 is out.

482,482,"I jumped from a iPhone XS to the S10. I'm a fan of new tech just like you and do it periodically. Ive never been a fan of the Pixel phones regardless of the clean Android experience because the hardware feels like poor quality. I usually jumped ship back to iOS because the phone either slowed down or app crashes. However this time I have been very pleased at the state of Android. 

Regarding security, I do not think you need a virus blocker or anything. The Samsung internet app is better than Chrome imo because it allows for you to add an adblocker which solves a lot of ad issues. Still not as good as Safari on iOS but much better than anything else on Android. Also the OS security on Android has gotten much better. Steve Gibson on Security Now just did a podcast where he came away very impressed with the latest security updates by Google. 

As for iMessages, there is obviously no clear alternative. I've heard that you can use the Google messages app on both phones and computer but I haven't used it. 

Apple Music is lot better on Android now. It was unusable in previous versions. However it is a lot better now. Has pretty much tthe same functionality as iOS. ",2019-04-06 05:11:35

Problem #1: Suddenly as of last night, my keyboard wouldn't open. I fixed this, as for some reason the phone had switched from Gboard to Samsung's default keyboard, which would not open.

Problem 2: Screen won't sleep. When plugged in or just when pressing the lock button, the screen fades to black and then immediately wakes back up with the pattern and ""Use fingerprint or draw pattern"" message.

Personally, I haven't used iMessage on a Mac but I do know that Pushbullet allows you to send messages from a PC (also transfer files between devices and such) 
and I'm sure that you can use it on a Mac as well. There's also AirDroid, which accomplishes the same thing.

Also, the Samsung ecosystem is pretty cool. I thought that Apple people were kind of over hyping having everything connected until I switched from OnePlus to Samsung. Samsung makes a lot of stuff, and having it all work together is incredibly convenient. My favorite is using my phone as a remote for my smart TV.

498,498,"This is not actually the case, I wasn't buying ti because I was loyal, I bought it because I trusted them to be out for the customer.

&amp;#x200B;

Telling me its ok to build weak flimsy devices because its the customer's fault if it breaks is not ok. Case in point, the cracked screen is not entirely my fault, as it is a device made ridiculously -long- so as to not fit in any standard pocket and it can not be protected by most protectors as it has a rounded screen for no particular reason other than to ""hide"" the phone edges from most viewers who think 1-2mm of Bezel is somehow bad. Its a trick to make you think there is no bezel when there is, its just that the glass is rounded there to make you see a screen still only now you can accidentally click buttons while simply trying to hold your phone.

&amp;#x200B;

Accidents happen, Areyes. My S3 was my first device, and often I only had service when it was in one specific spot in the room and only there. I had to keep it in that one exact spot on top of the mini fridge to get signal at all out here and no there is no other service that would have worked out here at that time. It often got knocked down by the cat or even that time there was a minor earth quake shook the house just enough to knock it down. I used to be weaker than I am now due to health problems, had a weak grasp on things and sometimes the phone would slip. A time when I was out on my bike going through grass, I hit a bump and the strap broke throwing the phone to the ground. These are just examples of the accidents that happened to my S3 and it survived with NO DAMAGE because Samsung made a great device and I loved them for it. I was so happy with it I stuck with Samsung to get my next device.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that the other potential devices cost hundreds more and weren't unlocked or compatible with the service I wanted to get. I found that I was able to get a discount on the S8 I was looking at, and could unlock it after a short time. When I got the device, I was a little disappointed because of how long it was, and the round screen edges, but at the time I didn't think they were terrible things. I bought a phone case for it, and found out that there are no reliable screen protectors for the device because of how the screen is designed, it is unprotectable to the primary way in which screens get cracked due to its round edge and 90% of screens were incompatible with the decent double layer cases.

&amp;#x200B;

It was only later on, months later, when I discovered that the battery can not be easily swapped. As if the phone was designed with a self destruct timer inside it because batteries are always the weakest component and are guaranteed to die within a year or two. Case in point, my battery has now expanded with enough force to push both the back panel off slightly, and make the screen of the phone dent forward in one spot. Now I must take the phone in to have a dangerous procedure done to repair it because Samsung has declared that I can't just walk in to a battery shop, pop the back off, plop the battery down on the table and say ""Hey, I need a new one of these"". A simple procedure for my old phone, you save no space GLUING the battery in, you don't get any added capacity, you don't protect the user any more with a GLUED IN BATTERY. There's no reason of any kind to GLUE a battery in. The fact that they glued the case on was enough to ensure the battery stays inside, and even then the internals show another support piece inside that also holds the battery in place. Why does Samsung feel the need to GLUE a battery in so that it can only be removed by exposing it to a dangerous situation like heating it up? Do they feel they need to make battery replacement so dangerous that it can kill people so as to prevent anyone from replacing their battery? Is it their goal to cause severe injury to anyone who tries to fix their own device? Whats the point of gluing a battery into a sealed device that already contains extra supports of its own for holding a battery inside a sealed confined space? The only reason I can think of, is what I listed above. To make battery replacement a dangerous complicated process that can severely injure people and destroy a device if you are unlucky or if you aren't a professional.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, is it still my fault I had health issues causing me to be unable to hold onto my phone perfectly? As you said, I should treat my devices better. You assume that accidents don't happen with that statement. You also forgot to think maybe there is a reason other than negligence that I could have been dropping the device a lot. You just came at me as if its my fault for being careless.

&amp;#x200B;

Is Samsung -really- giving people what they want when everyone just goes out and buys a phone protector? Why do they think people want something, and then see everyone go out and undo the things they were given? E.G. Thinner phones are negated by phone protectors. Tool kits are released to help people replace irreplaceable batteries and open up these sealed devices that are ridiculously designed so as to ensure no one can repair it. Replacement batteries are STILL a thing even with the new irreplaceable batteries. Is Samsung going to start banning people who talk about device repair like Apple did to that professional who repairs Apple devices and recovers the data that Apple proclaimed to be impossible to recover? I don't think Samsung would be so petty as to do that, with everything being on record on the internet, and users like me who often screenshot everything and back up website posts on ""the wayback machine"" to prevent censorship. I doubt Samsung would start doing that, but I don't know, I've started losing my faith in them.",2019-04-06 09:33:14

Hello all, I have a strange one:

Not too long ago I had a Samsung JV 3 phone, which served me well, but I broke it. So the phone was replaced with an exact model. Well...

...On the previous phone I could rotate the home screen from portrait to landscape, and the phone would flip display modes. So I tried to re-instate that feature on this replacement, only to not be able to rotate the home screen.

Yes, apps rotate when flipped to landscape. Yes, I called Verizon technical support, and Verizon even got in contact with Samsung, only to have Verizon tell me that feature was never available for that model phone. The help technician double-checked with me regarding the capability of changing display modes for home screens, app screens, and I confirmed I could do it with the previous phone. She seemed confused. So was I, as I clearly remember being able to flip the phone to landscape in home screen mode.

Did I miss something? Is there a feature or setting I'm completely overlooking? Any assistance would be appreciated.

**TLDR**: I used to be able to change the orientation of my home screens to either landscape or portrait, now I cannot. I would like to be able to rotate phone home screens to both display modes.",2019-04-30 13:03:26

78,78,"Finally got some good news! 

&amp;#x200B;

I submitted the ticket on April 9th, 2019.

After 9 emails and 7 calls (total of an hour and a half on the phone), I finally got an email today (not too long after another 21 minute) telling me that my refund was on the way. Overall I'm still out a bit of money - about $24 from keeping my protection plan on the old phone for two whole months just in case, and another $30 because a phone payment went through and the upgrade program only covers what was still owed on the previous device =/

&amp;#x200B;

I am super done dealing with it so I guess Samsung can keep that money. I will probably do the upgrade program again, but next time I'm not picking the fancy version of the phone - that way I can trade it in to someone more reliable for the next go around (I'm sure the ceramic s10 won't have extra trade in value.) I guess I could also sell it used, but doing phone sales myself, I've seen too many used phone sales go bad to risk it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for hangin' in with me there. If you ever trade in a device to Samsung yourself, make sure you take lots of pictures - maybe even video of yourself putting the device in the box. Or, as I recommend, trade it in to someone else. Spending an entire month wondering if that almost $500 was ever coming back to me, and whether it'd be worth taking legal action if it didn't was a real downer!",2019-05-01 16:51:34

I just prefer iOS over android. If there was a mistake it was getting the Note 9.

The price is quite a bit higher but I prefer them so much.

Anyways, congrats on joining the Samsung family! I would start getting use to things like your Samsung account,  gmail/gdrive account for your iOS cloud replacement. Its good to start getting familiar with it sooner rather than later when you start possibly getting flustered with storage and where things are being saved!

Samsung does not have much of a retail presence of its own, but has partnerships with several companies for customer support after sale. Most Best Buy stores have an Experience Consultant that can help with questions, general how-to and minor technical support. For hardware fixes, and larger software issues, UbreakIfix is the place. They do in and out of warranty work, you can set appointments via their website, and they use OEM parts. You can also use the Samsung Members app to web chat with a tech if needs be. Just wanted you to know you have a plethora of support for you. Hope you enjoy your new S10+!",2019-05-02 17:01:22

I live in Switzerland and I use the Swiss-French (QWERTZ with French autocorrect) keyboard in my daily life. I had my phone system language set to English as the main language, with swiss-French being second in the list. and discovered that the French keyboard was in AZERTY instead of QWERTZ only workaround I found is to switch my phone system language to Swiss-French instead of English, then the French keyboard would have the correct QWERTZ layout. 
Is there any way that I can get my phone in swiss-french QWERTZ while having my system language to english , with the default Samsung keyboard? I'm trying to avoid a third party keyboard since I like the Samsung one.

May I add I've already been in the AZERTY keyboard settings and on the dropdown list the only layout options I have are the 3x4 keyboard and Azerty.

186,186,"(I'm sorry this is so long. Two questions with bullet points if you want to skim.)

&amp;#x200B;

Recently had to upgrade the wifi at my place and now we have 2.4 and 5G. They told me to use 5G for all of my streaming. I've been using an older smart TV with limited capabilities so I just use a Chromecast for all of my streaming. Got it set up, used it for a few days with no issues whatsoever, but my TV suddenly died. It was a Vizio something or other that I traded an ex for when he moved out. 

• Anyway, now I need a new TV and I would like a nice smart TV with apps built in so I don't have to juggle apps on my phone and Chromecast all the time. BUT, I've noticed some popular smart TVs aren't 5G compatible (nearly bought a Samsung but noticed the complaints online). How do I know if a TV is 5G compatible? It doesn't say in the specs on Best Buy or Walmart's websites. Googling just brings up complaints from people trying to connect who are realizing the TV they just bought isn't compatible. 

• My second question is if I got one of these Samsung TVs that isn't compatible with 5G, can I just use a Chromecast and have the Chromecast and my phone connected to the 5G and not my TV? I'm assuming that my old smart TV wasn't 5G compatible but I never connected the TV to the internet, just the Chromecast. But could that be what killed it? I'm thinking my internet provider should have warned us about this, but I barely know anything about this lol.... 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",2019-05-03 07:21:17

These are not small problems... And you're not some special human who gets to notice these issues while ""99% of people will go about their days without even noticing them.""

Random screen flickers at times and random vibrations? Those are major issues and something 100% of people will notice. As for unnecessary lags... I can't say much about that since ""lag"" in general is very subjective. 

&gt;You must think I have a lot of time on my hands. For all I know, the problems might have even disappeared because I reset it when i sold it

Hmm. So, because you don't have time on your hand, you couldn't even reset the phone to check if it would fix the problems. You instead took pictures and put up your Note 9 for sale on some website, went out to buy a new phone, and either shipped the Note 9 to the buyer or met the buyer in person in a public location to do a cash transaction, all while still having to reset the phone for the sale? And the phone you decided to get is another Android while you're here boasting about the great OS iPhones have?

Anyways, let me help you understand something. Whatever happened to your Note 9 is called a defect. Defects happen, which is why Samsung has manufacturer's warranty. No matter how much you prefer the iPhone's OS, they are also prone to defects, which is why Apple has manufacturer's warranty. 

If I get an iPhone with unusual problems that 99.99999% of the iPhone users don't experience but use these problems to say a statement like ""This is why iPhone's OS is inferior to Android,"" I would probably become the laughingstock.

But having said that, the iPhone 8 really isn't any different from the 6S, you lose the headphone jack and I was bored of having the same phone. I also didn't really use the continuity features between all 3 devices all that much. I didn't want to go to an X model as I'm not comfortable with facial recognition biometrics and the X models lose Touch ID altogether. I would essentially be getting the same phone minus some features I enjoyed if I'd stayed with Apple (even if I could afford an X model). 

&amp;#x200B;

Or I could get the Samsung, which was the same price as the 8, but a brand new smartphone with way more features and customisability and kept the features I would lose by staying with Apple. The transfer of data went smoothly and the only things I've really lost are a couple of paid apps and game data as well as internet bookmarks. but contacts, pictures, notes even, have all ported across fine. its going to take a while to get used to as there are SO MANY more settings and options with Android, but I definitely don't think that's a bad thing.

278,278,"Four features ios has that Android doesn't: Facetime, iMessage, live Camera, and a working face id. After I switched to Samsung there was nothing at all that I missed. With Android pie and Samsung One, Android has a much more premium feel to it. I have to admit I was not a big fan of Lolipop. Transfering data from your phone will be easy as Samsungs ship with a wire that you just connect and it all transfers within an hour. You can also transfer things to or from your Android just by dragging them from your PC. That is literally the biggest thing that made me switch and I love it. Samsungs also have multi tasking, so you can have two apps on your screen at a time. You can watch Youtube in the background and it even works with some music video.(Not with all) You don't need all of your apps on the home screen. a lot nicer than Siri, even if it's ui isn't as nice imo. You can also put widgets on the home screen, (I sort of miss the ios widget page) or make blank home screens to enjoy your wallpaper. File management is a dream, just make new folders and drag files around with your PC. You have a standard USB-C charger that lasts longer. The phones are all much better value. (AAt least with the S Series, idk about Note) The 128 gb Samsung is 50 dollars cheaper than the iPhone XR and has a better screen, the 512GB S10 is 200 dollars cheaper than the 256GB XS, and the 512gb S10+ is 300 dollars cheaper than the XS Max.

&amp;#x200B;

There are some downsides to Samsung and Android. From what I hear Samsung is terribly slow with updates. The RAM management is shit. My phone has 6gbs and just sitting at the home screen takes up half of it. When you have several apps open in the background it really really really shows.  That's all I have really noticed. I might find out more as time goes on.",2019-05-04 23:40:49

Recommend checking that out, it's pretty neat. Made me want to by a the Samsung s4 or upcoming s5 tablet which has the S-pen with it.
Love the Note series. I'm a rookie when it come to flashing and roms and all that, but  I even flashed it to android 9.0 a few months before it was released in the states, than I rei stalled in back to android 8.0, than the pushed the update officially in the states and got 9.0 OTA.

I am on my second Samsung TV.  First was was high end for its day $2k+... failed in 5 years, something about the power supply.  My current TV is 4.5 years old, gets used &lt;4 hrs a day.  Screen flashed the other night and now the top has lines and is slow to refresh.  I went through the diagnostics and its some kind of board failure.  

My question is why buy Samsung?  I can buy a POS Walmart off brand the dies every 4-5 years.  I buy name brand to avoid these issues.  They referred me to a local TV tech, no idea what that will cost.  Prob cheaper to buy another, wont be a Samsung.

I have a Samsung Galaxy S8 which I gave to a certified repair center in Italy for a burn in problem, covered by the european warranty of two years. I called today to ask about the status of the repair and they told me that they also replaced the battery, but they did not inform me beforehand about this and they didn't tell me what was the problem with the battery.

My questions are

Is it normal? Should I be worried about something? Is it shady? Why could they have replaced the battery?",2019-05-07 07:20:12

I love the mate 20 pro tho, i did get the samsung for a better multimedia experience overall and for the UI, not considering the price difference, they also gave me a free printer worth like 150£ alone so yeah.. good deal i guess, for around 200 euros",2019-05-07 07:50:58

I'd really recommend getting the insurance. I've gotten like 7 replacements and even have been upgrades twice for the replacement cost of $5. Literally got hooked from a note 4 to a galaxy s7 fit $5. Also since ive been a loyal customer they also sent me a replacement of an old phone I didn't have insurance on that I didn't even use anymore.

I very rarely intentionally use bixby but regardless, it's just not an issue. I have no idea what you are talking about in regards to it trying to force you to use it and force you to waste your money, I've never had that issue.

386,386,"I made the same exact move a few weeks back. Went from an iPhone XS with Apple Watch and now have a Samsung s10+ 512gb ceramic black with a galaxy watch.

The switch was painless and soon had my apps all set up and I was back to having a phone setup as I wanted in a few days. 

Now the question of the ecosystem, it’s the one that usually pulls you back unless you are set in your mind you want to change and not just want to play with a new shiney toy. The usual problem is moving to an android phone and then wanting to be set up and work as an iPhone, you want it to integrate with all your other apple products and in essence want nothing to change. If that’s your approach, save your money and stay with Apple.

If however you are going to embrace the Chang, be willing to change daily workflows and usage. Make the new device work for you rather than trying to making it work like an Apple product ... then you will make the switch and soon discover a device more than capable of doing all you thought you needed and much more.

I am really enjoying the S10+ and can honestly say I haven’t regretted the move. The camera is excellent, but word of advice don’t keep comparing to iPhone pictures as they both process images in a different way so you will be continually finding differences. Learn to use the new camera and enjoy using it to capture great images. Don’t forget the old saying “the best camera is the one you have with you”

438,438,"1. Samsung has it's own in built remapping service.  I have the Bixby button set to open up my bus and train times. It works flawlessly.

2. Bixby is completely unobtrusive across my device. I don't use it at all and its never once been opened accidentally, it doesn't push notifications to me, I don't have the panel to the left of the home screen turned on.

3. Bixby isn't designed to replace anything. Google voice assistant has it's own hardware button on the phones, holding in the pressure sensitive home  button engages it. What it's designed to do is operate within the bounds of the Samsung ecosystem, using Samsung's well established smart devices, such as refrigerators, dishwashers, washing machines, TVs, stereos, etc.

4. The app suite isn't a copy of anything. Its an alternative to Google services. Personally,  I don't use many of them, however I do use the calendar, notes, email, and internet. I do this for the simple reason of, I can set up adblockers, I avoid using Google services as much as possible to preserve my online privacy. 

5. The use case for the sort of things you're describing is very narrow and specific. People will buy a case with an air quality sensor due to, as a simplification, 2 reasons: they have a reason to doubt their air quality and it's a cheap/convenient method of doing so. 

This is great, and it's a clever implementation of tech. A purpose built sensor with purpose built software is going to be cheaper to develop than as a feature on an already expensive device. Samsung's flagships use the best screens, processors, and other parts available. This eats into development budget. 

6. With several billion dollars behind you, you could make a feature-rich phone that I have no doubt would be a great device to use, if you had any intelligence. However,  could you market it, produce it and make a profit on it while listening to investors and directors and management? I doubt it. 

Risk-taking in technology has become less mainstream due to the dropping in profits over the last year or so in the smartphone market, particularly in the premium ranges. This isn't Samsung specific. 

7. Yep, note phones are the best in the world for productivity, nothing like them, nothing as well implemented as them. 

8. You can uninstall it. You can wipe your entire device and install a custom ROM. Nobody is stopping you.

444,444,"Hello everyone, Note 9 user here having extremely frustrating Bluetooth issues, specifically audio quality.

I've tried around 6 different Bluetooth earbud sets, ranging from cheap Amazon brands to beatsx.

Everything seems to connect and use a shitty codec, usually SBC but one or two use AAC and still have garbled sound. doesn't seem to matter what the advertised codec or Bluetooth revision is.

This is backed up by the fact that I can't change the codec in the developer options, and by the fact that when I pair these same devices to my old iPhone 5s, the sound quality is fine, no garbling, no disconnects, volume is fine etc. this goes for all tested devices except one of the cheap Amazon brands which sounded bad on both devices, and the beatsx which sound good on both but are a much older model and don't work in other ways. (disconnects, resetting pairing, doesn't hold a charge etc.)

I use Bluetooth earbuds every day at work and frequently in my non work life, and I've had this note 9 for about 6 months now and I'm starting to question if I should keep it.

I ordered some new Galaxy buds that will be here sometime this week, if those work and sound good and I'm happy then I may stick with them and the note. 

just curious if anyone has any insight on this because it severely limits the value of this expensive phone for me. curious if it's a Samsung thing, a note 9 thing, an android thing, or what. because I have considered a pixel phone and I even entertain switching back to whatever iPhone they come out with this year.

Thanks for your time.",2019-05-08 06:11:39

I have few questions regarding Samsung devices.

I am owner of Samsung Galaxy Tab A 2019 and Samsung A6.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know how to do the following.

&amp;#x200B;

1)

I would like to connect 1 Device to WIFI Network and then share this network to 2 Device (does not matter which one is connected to WIFI and which is sharing network)

I just can only connect to the WIFI directly using 1 device, and need to share network to the 2nd. But I cannot make a Hot Spot while connected to WIFI

2)

Samsung A6 has Split Screen option. Unfortunately applications running on the split screen does not work simultaneously. Only 1 application is active at a any given time.

Is there anyway to set both apps to be active ?

&amp;#x200B;

3) 

How I can prevent apps to ""disconnect"" while in the background ? (both devices)

Sometimes they disconnect within 5 secs...

&amp;#x200B;

4) Is there anyway I can create a shortcut on main screen with one of the Apps installed in Secure Folder ? So i don't have to open it and then open app.

492,492,"I personally love the curved screen. Every screen is fragile, so this is too, but if you get a screen protector that shouldn't be an issue. 

The curved screen also nearly completely eliminates the side bezels, as it wraps around where they would usually be, giving a fuller and more immersive view.

There is a glare on the curves, but imo it actually looks nice. When using the phone, they way that things kind of flow off of the screen when you swipe gives it a really unique and interesting look. When watching Fullscreen video, you can see a slight difference in color from the main screen and the curves (just because of how OLED looks from an angle), but I don't think it impacts the viewing experience at all. If anything it makes it look a little better to me.

The curved screen also adds an interesting functionality; the edge screen. This means you can swipe from the very edge if the screen and bring up a panel of apps (that you choose), quick actions, your music, the weather, calendar, etc. This works on a flat screen, but I think with a case on a flat screen phone it's very difficult to access. I didn't think it was going to be something if actually use, but I put my most used apps there, and now I use it all the time.

People also talk about accidental touches. I use a very thin clear case, and I have only accidentally touched the edge 5 times at most since I've had the phone. If you have a case, you most likely won't have accidental touches, and if you do, there's an app in Goodlock (goodlock is a group of Samsung apps for extra customization) that can add dead zones to the edges so you don't accidentally touch the edges.

The curved screen also works great with a screen protector. Plastic and glass both work fine, the biggest difference is that the glass needs to have a LOCA application in order to work with the fingerprint sensor underneath the screen. I've applied two Whitestone dome screen protectors to my S10+, and it looks and works great, and doesn't hinder my fingerprint sensor at all.

Speaking of the fingerprint sensor, I know some people are going to say that the sensor under the glass is bad and/or doesn't work well. That's mostly not true. A lot of people never had any issues with it in the first place, and for people who did have issues with it, it got a few updates and now works even better, even with screen protectors.",2019-05-09 06:16:37

Mobile data just stops working after 10 seconds on S10+.. please help!

I'm really having a problem with my Samsung Galaxy S10+

I'm hoping you guys can help me. I bought the cheaper ""Singapore"" version of the phone. It's $700 on eBay / Amazon compared to $900 for the U.S version. The phone came new, in the original box, with the original seal. Everything about the phone works great (screen, etc.) except for mobile data.

I'm absolutely perplexed why mobile data can't work properly on this phone. I'm hoping someone knows what the issue is or can help me troubleshoot it!

I'm coming from using a Huawei Mate 20 Pro. My mobile data worked perfectly on this phone. I just turn on mobile data and it works all the time. However, with the Samsung S10+ I turn on mobile data and it works literally for 10 seconds. It's great that it works but only for 10 seconds. If I either put the phone into airplane mode or restart the phone.. the mobile data again works for 10 seconds and then 'shuts off'. I mean mobile data is still technically turned on. But mobile data just stops working and the ""4g"" at the top disappears.

I'm using the AT&amp;T / TMobile network. There's no reason it shouldn't be working properly. When I go into settings on the S10+ and check the network status it shows ""disconnected.""

Please help me.. how can I prevent the phone from disconnecting from the mobile network after 10 seconds? I've never seen this issue with a phone before, so I'm uncertain of what's happening. The mobile data / network still works perfectly in my old Huawei phone.",2019-06-01 19:03:58

The settings app for instance is no longer a dual pane UI like it was in 8.0, so navigating system settings is much more tedious. Where the hell is the logic in that? I've noticed Dex mode also has larger scaling and the UI elements take up more space. The update looks nice but it was a huge step back in functionality on a 10.5 inch screen. 

They sound like small things, but Samsung already did a good job at making Android's UI more functional on a larger screen over stock, but now tthey made it woese. It's pretty disappointing.",2019-06-01 20:48:26

149,149,"The Samsung Doorstep Repair Service is provided by a company called WeFix (Rated 9.5/10 on Trust Pilot as of 03/06/2019).

To give some background, you can arrange one of these 'Doorstep Repairs' through Samsung's website. They do all the latest S and Note devices and tablets. (All the way back to the S5 and Note 4) as well as some A and J devices. All you have to do to get a quote is your postcode. They use genuine parts.

Normally a screen replacement for a Galaxy Note 9 is £229 (a free battery replacement is included) but I managed to win a competition on the Samsung Members app where I received a screen replacement using doorstep repairs for free.

Now the booking experience is quite simple, you can select multiple things to be repaired, like the screen, cameras, battery (by itself), ear piece speaker, back glass and the charging port.
You can select any weekday to get a repair but do note that you cannot chose a time slot (more on that).

After booking my doorstep repair I waited until the day of the repair, where at 8am I received both an email and a text message from WeFix informing me of the hour time slot for my repair, as well as the name of the technician who would be repairing my device.

So I waited a few hours until about 11am (about in the middle of the time slot I was given) and the technician arrived in his van. (The vans are quite easy to spot as they have WeFix and lots of information on every side - it's not just a plain white van).

The technician was quite friendly and inspected my device quickly before taking it back to his van and repairing it. The whole repair took about an hour, with the screen and the battery being tested. As well, my device was tested to make sure it was still water resistant.

When I received my device back, I inspected it myself and it was done brilliantly. Another nice touch is that a plastic screen protector was also applied (and quite precisely) which is good because my screen was previously scratched a fair bit.

I also received a discount code that would take 10% off any future repair through WeFix.

Overall, the experience and the repair were very good and I would recommend them to anyone who wishes to have their Samsung device repaired.

However, one negative of the experience was the amount of emails I received after the repair, about 4 or 5 I got in total after about a day or two afterwards. These emails were all about recommending and reviewing WeFix. I wouldn't mind one or two but 5 is excessive and quite irritating.

If you want any further clarification on anything or have any questions, I will try my best to answer them and I hope you found this helpful and a little bit informative.

Sorry if it went on for a bit long and thanks for reading!",2019-06-03 10:09:48

189,189,"I've owned the buds since launch. I use them as commuter earphones, I do my heavy listening on Shure se846s using the ifi xdsd connected to my S8+.

The good: convenience. The buds are fantastic if you're using a galaxy phone, I've had no issues with using them. They're by far the most convenient pair of buds out there for a galaxy phone. 

The features are fantastic too: wireless charging, a voice-enhancing hear through feature and built in voice assistant makes these fantastic for daily use. I tend to leave my phone in my bag and just use the voice assistant to control everything.

The price: they're dirt cheap obviously, around 100 - 120 euros last I checked, provided you're not actually buying them directly from Samsung. Can't complain about the price.

The bad: the sound. As much as I love them, and as much as I use them, I would not recommend them as a main pair of earbuds. They don't support the AptX codec. They sound better using Dolby Atmos, barely. The bass is ok, but anything in the mids and highs is going to be lacking compared to a wired pair of a similar price.",2019-06-04 05:18:15

The main reason to use samsung's apps is that they look clean and most importantly, they ALL have dark mode.

Personally, i feel theyre in properly when i feel them blocking all sound/wind from entering where the inner piece sits. I might just prefer a tighter fit or something. Again, that upper part i twist them into do hurt after prolonged use but i just live with it i guess. They dont always get to this position everytime i put them in, sometimes i need to retry or twist them a bit.

I remember seeing an ad on youtube for these buds where the athlete did a twist to put them in, idk if that was just advertising making them look more appealing or if that is how theyre supposed to be put in properly.

If they just made them all to do so, I feel like they could better advertise them as something unique, like the Samsung Gear Twist Buds lol",2019-06-04 11:05:08

Anyways I'm using my daily for loads of shit.. like yt and drawing/photoshop if I'm chilling or for reading catching notes some light c++ work or presentations for school stuff.. 

Like I literally haven't used books at home since I got it xd I take a picture send them to a tablet via samsung flow and from there I can read whenever highlight what's important or have samsung notes in split screen along with floating keyboard to catch notes that way..  
I also do all of my practice on it as well like tasks from physic or math (bc I can have my calculator, solutions and yt floating above split screen view of notes and tasks like it's so much more convenient than having notebook book and workbook as well as the calculator all around you xd (especially if you do most of your shit in bed like me xd)
Also writing with a pen is super good and I actually have a bit better handwriting on it than a proper notebook xd

Soo all in all for me it's an amazing thing and sure I wish it had some more stuff like premier pro or maybe 12"" display but for that money I can't complain..

Now for just content consumption like idk I don't think it's actually worth it especially not 600e.. like you can get really good smart tv for that money and just play yt from your phone on it and enjoy..",2019-06-06 12:30:31

306,306,"Yeh, I understand where you’re coming from as the design doesn’t seem very Samsung-esque. And yeh, leakers aren’t always 100% right, so there is a smudge of hope that the Note10 will be something entirely different.",2019-06-06 13:41:31
307,307,"I'm worried... Even though I have Galaxy Buds (they're currently with Samsung getting the charging case replaced because I lost it - side note, $77 AUD - roughly $50 USD before tax - for a replacement case, much cheaper than I was expecting), I still want a headphone jack, because I have multiple pairs of headphones, including wired studio headphones, which I like to plug into my phone.

I guess I could just get the S10+ (or I guess I don't really *need* an upgrade, I have the S8+), but I was hoping that I'd like the Note 10, because I've wanted a phone with the S Pen ever since I got the Galaxy Tab S4.

I guess we'll see",2019-06-06 13:42:35
308,308,"I thought the S10 did it perfectly. It had a headphone jack, *and* shipped with free wireless headphones if you pre-ordered. Maybe the Galaxy Buds should have been taken as a warning, but I guess I was hoping that the S10 having a headphone jack despite being launched with wireless headphones was a good sign for the future of headphone jacks.

I bought Galaxy Buds for my S8+ (then proceeded to lose the case after less than a week - Samsung are able to replace it for a decent price, luckily, it just has to go through their repair channels), so I guess the lack of a headphone jack won't affect me too much. But I guess I just like the idea of being able to use whatever headphones I like at any time. Some apps (*glares at Twitch*) don't correctly sync their audio with video when using wireless headphones, so I like to have wired headphones on hand for those cases.

As it stands, this is a rumour. There were also rumours that the S8 wouldn't have a headphone jack, and it did (iirc the S10 has similar rumours), so I'm still holding out hope. But if it is true, I'm just hoping that they handle it in a decent way (like having a dongle with a high-quality DAC and fast charging passthrough included in the box, as an example).",2019-06-06 13:50:10

322,322,"Hmm, yeh it is definitely a pity. If you do want to upgrade and are willing to pay a premium, the S10 5G is always an option worth considering. Unlike the Note10, it has a headphone jack and I’m very sure that Samsung would just reuse the display, camera and performance of the S10 5G in the upcoming Pro version of the Note. So you won’t be missing out on much.

Of course, if that S Pen is something you really care about, you really have no option other than to go with the Note9. It’s still a great phone, but of course, it’s no longer the best Samsung offers.",2019-06-06 22:28:22

So when I finally reached my limit and needed a new phone, I was going to go with the OnePlus 6T. Tried it in a T-Mobile store, and holy god, the input lag on the screen is terrible. I could never get used to that. It would bug me every single day.

So I gave Samsung a second chance and ran with a Note 9. I'm glad I did. This thing is snappy as hell and is still holding up well. My 7 Edge started slowing down within the first 6 months and was *horrendous* after a year. I still don't know what the hell made it so slow, since plenty of people online said theirs worked great after 2 years. But the Note 9 is probably the best phone I've ever owned.",2019-06-07 05:19:09

381,381,"Hey there! 
Thanks for the follow up message. 

TL;DR: I do not regret it at all. 

In longer, there were couple issues I faced with a phone for the past couple month. However, all of them are fixable via 3rd party apps, apk's or other tricks. 
In-screen FP scanner works 2-3 times faster than couple months ago. Galaxy buds are stable now. No issues with sounds desync or anything like that. 
The only regret I have - color choice. Black color is too simple. White looks cool AF! Wish to rewind and change it to white ... 

In regards to Apple. I do not belive in 5G. I mean, it is cool. Faster speed and anything like that BUT. The area where I live, I don't even have all stable 4 bars of LTE. Connection is not always that stable with LTE, so 5G won't change anything + too early to tell. 

X is a good phone. As I said couple months ago, if you don't have any issues with a phone. If it sufficient enough for you - just keep it. 
If you must switch to something - definitely try Samsung.",2019-06-07 11:10:53

442,442,"I love having it for running. I use Nike run club to track my runs normally, and unfortunately the watch does not support Nike run club. Imit does support map my run and I believe Strava as well. I usually just load up a run on the Samsung health app on my watch and then also run with my phone for the Nike run club. I also can't sync my heart rate to NRC either, but this isn't an issue with the watch per se.

I also wear my phone at work and it's great to quickly view notifications on my watch rath aser than pulling my phone out. You can also reply to messages on platforms like WhatsApp and messenger, it has a to format of text, but I don't particularly like that. 

One of the major downsides for me is the battery life. I get maximum of 2 days usually, and it takes about 2 hours to charge. This can be annoying, particularly for me when I may work a triplet of 13 hour shifts with a run after each shift... I sometimes completely forget it needs charging, and I ideally want at least 30 percent before I go out on a run.

As I generally like to keep track of my health, I use Samsung health anyways and it's been ok, I feel like things could be better, but it's good. I like how it measures my sleep every night I have it on and measures my heart rate at intervals. There is supposedly a blood pressure feature, but this isn't available in my country (UK) so I know nothing about it.",2019-06-09 00:48:20

457,457,"After 6.5 days of use...

**Galaxy Fit Pros:** 

\- Very light and small tracker. But device itself is a little thicker than the Charge 3.  

\- Clearer, higher-resolution screen than the Charge 3.  It's nice to be able to clearly read what a notification says. 

\- A little easier to see in direct sunlight than the Charge 3.  Still not perfect. 

\- Heart rate and step count accuracy seems comparable to my Charge 3.  Whew!

\- **Synching/notifications work flawlessly** (with my Pixel 3a).  Changing a clock face is instantaneous.  Vibrations are strong.  

\- ""Do Not Disturb"" mode, ""Good Night"" mode, both easily accessible from band.  No hunting around for hard-to-find settings on tracker or app.  

\- Can set display brightness from 1-10 on tracker.

\- I really like the Samsung Health app.  I particularly like that it actually tells me what it is doing when it is synching.  It tells me what data it is downloading from the device.  Very nice to see instead of Fitbit's useless ""progress bar."" 

\- The band auto-detected ""workouts"" when I was walking and mowing the lawn.  Very nice.  Couldn't select ""mowing lawn"" as a workout category, though. 

\- Not sure if this is a pro or con, but the display turns on when you make an arm movement that is anywhere close to lifting your hand to your face.  The Fitbit Charge 3 was the opposite -- sometimes I had to make an exaggerated arm movement just to get the display to turn on. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Galaxy Fit Cons:**

\- Poor battery life so far.  Just 3 days with HR set to ""Always"".  Looks like maybe 4-5 days with it set to ""Frequent"" (every 10 minutes when not working out).  Must have to turn off notifications to get the advertised ""about a week.""

\- Band is not particularly comfortable, and is very hard to adjust tighter, once you've got it on.  Easier just to take it off and start over.  Worried about durability of band due to having to fold the end ""under"" when putting it on.  People with small wrists might not like this band.  

\- Although there are many variations of clock faces to choose from, they're not customizable.  You have to pick your poison from the available 24 choices.  Get ready to see some pinks/yellows/reds on your clock face. 

\- **Resting** heart rate seemed comparable to what Fitbit told me until I switched the Heart Rate setting from ""Always"" to ""Frequent.""  With it set to Frequent, the resting heart rate number doesn't seem even close anymore. 

\- I regularly see different little icons show up at the top of the clock face, but I have no idea what they are supposed to indicate. 

\- When I get more than one notification at a time, I'm not sure how to see more than the first one.  Scrolling/back doesn't seem to do it.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sad that the battery life seems worse than advertised, and I am not a fan of the band on this device (I hope replacement bands become available on Amazon soon), but I do plan to wear the Galaxy Fit until a better option comes along.   Samsung should sell a lot of these at the $99 price-point (assuming they ever officially go on sale).",2019-06-09 09:31:24

And second of all Samsung does *not* install Facebook on your phone. What Samsung installs is the Facebook App Manager/Installer, which is basically a placeholder app that only prompts you you to download Facebook (the actual app) if opened.

The said placeholder app will not eat up 200mb of your storage. Some other app or service is automatically downloading it.

Few things to note:
- Bought last October 2018.
- Was able to connect to WiFi normally before.
- Issue will not appear or happen on other devices connected in the wifi but they will be disconnect once my phone shows the exclamation point.
- Issue has happened on multiple Wifi connections already.
- Exclamation point started to appear last April.

Troubleshooting Steps done:

- Reset Wifi Settings
- Reset Phone (Hard and Soft Reset)
- Brought phone to Samsung Service center, reset it using their own tools.
- Main board already replaced by them.

At this point, I can no longer use the phone since the connection won't stay connected for me to update the apps and software fully.

The Warranty is definitely NOT active as there is a sticker on the outside advising the Malaysian retailer to activate the Warranty at time of sale to the specific customer, which eGlobal most definitely does NOT do.

* Battery Life isn't the best - seems Exynos processors may be more power hungry. Also it won't charge with lower power chargers, so some of my older stands/chargers don't charge it...but the QC3 and Adaptive Fast Samsung ones do fine.
* Case variety is a bit wanting, since it's not a mainstream US model...and I've not found a good one with auto wake/sleep magnet when open/close. Infiniland makes a couple OK ones.

I signed into my Samsung account and did every sync/import/etc. option there is and nothing happened. Can someone please tell me if there's a way to fix this? Or am I just royally thunder-fucked in my tight 'lil virgin ass for trusting a fucking phone with every little idea/thought/etc. I've had over the past, as I said, 1 year+.

Thank you in advance!",2019-07-05 15:10:33

285,286,"**Should I get the Tab S4 now, or wait for the Tab S5 to release?**

---

So I'm looking to get a tablet. A lot of people have said an iPad is the best buy at the moment, but in my case I don't think that's true. Firstly, the non-pro models have thick bezels, no USB-C ports, and too little storage. The pros are better, but no headphone jack, and no internal SD card slot, means I'd be forced to buy the 512GB or 1TB version, since I require a lot of space. Those are as expensive as high end laptops, at which point I'd prefer a laptop.

Meanwhile the Tab S4 on the other hand, is actually under my original intended budget, looks the perfect size, has nice small bezels like the iPad Pros, comes with the pen, comes with proper bluetooth keyboard/mouse support, has a headphone jack, has microSD support.. Couple that with the fact I've owned a Samsung phone before and it had the nicest screen out of any phone I've bought before. Plus, I'm already an Android user, so it means I don't have to figure out alternatives for all the apps I've been using.

So it seems like a no-brainer, but just now while reading about Linux on Dex, I noticed mention of a Tab S5 on the site, so I googled it, and some sites are suggesting the Tab S5 will be released next month, with the new Snapdragon 855 processor. This is tempting because while 95% of the stuff I want the tablet for probably isn't too resource intensive, I do like the idea of video editing on my tablet, and I think the extra performance would be seen there. 

What do you guys think - worth waiting?",2019-07-06 10:39:11

303,304,this would actually be really good news. 3 years worth of updates from samsung is a step in the right direction and makes me feel way better about my purchases with them. now lets just hope the rumors arent real about the note 10 with a headphone jack.,2019-07-06 19:40:49
304,305,"Hey all, 

So yesterday I recorded 2 videos totaling up to about 30 mins together. I did this on my Samsung S8,and I've never experienced this issue before. When I go to gallery I first see [this](http://imgur.com/gallery/Vx8JOfw). 

And when I click on the video to play it, it says ""Can't play video"", see [screenshot](http://imgur.com/gallery/UGUSZJA).

So then I thought maybe the file is too large, let me copy it to my computer and play it from there. Once I did that and tried playing it, [this](http://imgur.com/gallery/94VOpxe) is the message that shows up on my computer screen. 

Note: I tried a few ""solutions"" I found online, like restarting my phone, resetting app preferences, etc. 

Appreciate any help, thanks!",2019-07-06 19:41:36

Now it's been adopted in the following models and no headline since then says anything in the line of ""APPLE DIDN'T RE-INTRODUCE THE HEADPHONE JACK"" because everyone stopped caring. Yes there's people that will never want it to go like yourself but the future is wireless, portless phones. That's the way it is. Being salty about the removal is fine, but stop making the 100th post about the note removing it, we've known for months now that it was going to be a thing. We get it, it sucks, the world is ending, blah blah blah. It was going to happen sooner or later. Just rip off the bandaid and move on. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for the punchhole camera. What's different than the s10? Yeah it's in the middle, so what? People apparently still want a selfie camera and the tech to fit it under the display isn't mature enough to be made mainstream for atleast another 2 gens. 

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding the removal of retina scanning, if you've ever used it you know that it takes long and it sucks. Once samsung finds their version of Face ID everything will be good, but until then just use the fingerprint scanner or face unlock. Yes it's not as secure but bull f\*cking shit if you tell me that you used the retinal scanning each and every day because it's shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding the wireless buds, they never said they would include it in the phone? It might be a pre-order bonus but that's it. People are switching to wireless every day, look around, airpods are everywhere nowadays because it's conveniant. If you really want the audio experience from a pair of wired headphones just use a DAC or w/e their called to actually get some nice sound from your phone. Or you better get used to that dongle life because it's coming.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To end this long ass rant. Just find alternatives to the 3.5 jack. Yes it's difficult and something that shouldn't be happening but it is. So stop PMSIng about it.

393,394,"I was playing around in the service menu and changed a couple things, and my Samsung J6201 started bootlooping. It would infinitely power on, get to the Samsung Smart TV logo, then power off, then do the same thing again. From a quick search, it appeared that I had to reset the EEPROM. So I cracked the back of it open and preceded to spend 4-5 hours tinkering with it. The EEPROM chip on my model is the ATMLH536 (circled in blue). https://i.imgur.com/n9BMWMa.jpg Here's the diagram for the chip. https://i.imgur.com/zq4hVcs.jpg
Per the SamyGo wiki and other posts there, I tried connecting Vcc and SDA and turned the TV on, it kept bootlooping like normal. I also tried holding it until the display turned on and immediately removed it after, that didn't work either. When I connect Ground and SDA, the TV immediately shuts off, but when it turns on it just keeps bootlooping. I tried connecting Vcc and Ground to SCL, that also didn't do anything.

I do love the customization on the S10e though and Samsung pay cannot be beat. I also prefer the hole punch over the notch and the fingerprint sensor is pretty handy so I don’t have to awkwardly stare at the phone to unlock it like with Face ID.

468,469,"I think the user tries to say, the performance expectation depends on the owner of the phone. I never play games on the phone, my usage mainly leans on videos, internet surf and social media. With that perspective buying a flagship phone just for this light resource usage is waste of money for me.

In my opinion phone screens beyond 1080p resolution just marketing gimmicks. No matter how high quality they are, the viewing experience not even a notch of 4k monitors or 4k tv's. More battery consumption is a downside comes with that.

A50 is able to record 4k 30fps with Opencamera app. Samsung's camera software not even in par with the camera hardware on the phone. The main 1080p 30fps setting comes with the phone records with 17 megapixels, not even using the full potential of 25mp camera. With the next update samsung gives ultra slow motion and night mod on their camera app. Indian market already got the update.

I thing you got the ram and storage data wrong. A50 has 6gb ram and 128gb storage+ microsd option. The budget flagship s10e has the same ram and storage figures. You get more juice with the next steps of S family (duh!).

Final words, if you don't use camera much (I took about 30 photos per year) and you don't play games on your phone the A50 worth the money but if photography is important to you, stay away from this phone. If you are a mobile gamer be aware, this phone doesn't perform awesome on ultra settings on most games but anything beside those, you'll pretty much get the same things you get on S series.",2019-07-09 11:09:39

38,38,"IMO the outcry wasn't really as big with the IR blaster. Plus Samsung had an ulterior motive with that because they're pushing Smart Things, one remote to control everything and it won't rely on IR.
Same as with removable battery. Instead of manufacturers trying to attract Samsung customers with removable batteries, the majority of them went with Samsung in sealed units.
In the case of microSD, many manufacturers kept it and the memory of the S6 and Note 5 simply weren't enough for it to go just yet.
The return of the headphone jack now rests on 2 things. 1 is the Pixel. The Pixel 3a brought back the jack in their lineup. If the P4 gets it, then we have a viable competitor to Samsung that has it. 2 is the sales of the Note 10. If it's low and the major reason is the jack.
So Samsung does have a history to backtrack, but only when certain conditions arise. If the loss of the jack does not affect sales, they might not.",2019-07-31 17:11:20

But I call the Sprint authorize company store and they're telling me, ""No, we cannot repair or change your screen because of a scratch."" I called Asurion, they're telling me, ""You filed your claim and now we want you to take your device to a Sprint store for a tech to look at your device.""

This is really annoying. My phone is scratched. I pay for insurance. But I'm getting sent all over the place? 

I'm now left to contact Samsung. It's a deep scratch on the lower portion of my phone screen. The screen still works! But the scratch is annoying me.

I also contacted Samsung tech support who told me to pick ""cards"" under Bixby settings and turn it off- unfortunately ""Cards"" is not an option under my Bixby settings.

The iPhone 6s isn’t a recent flagship as it came out nearly five years ago. iOS has improved and iPhones have improved as well. Specs don’t speak for the user experience on a phone, software and integration does... and Apple does software better. iOS is a lot more fluid, a lot faster and a lot cleaner than Samsung’s OneUI. Also you mention the iPhone XR’s 1080p display, but the Note 10 literally has a 1080p display as well. These companies aren’t so different in their tactics.

Wowza, Android is customizable. Did all that copy and pasting for nothing because no one said it wasn’t? And yeah, iOS is better than OneUI. It’s a lot less bloated than OneUI, a lot smoother and a lot faster. Sure you have widgets and stuff, but usually people install launchers over Samsung’s OneUI because of how clunky it is anyway.  I agree in the fact that in a lot of ways Android is better than iOS, but the software is a lot cleaner and faster on iPhones. 

You can customize sound on iPhone, though I’ll admit there is no Dolby Atmos.

People who use the “Samsung makes their screen,” argument have no idea what they’re talking about. Samsung isn’t just letting them barrow their technology, that’s not how it works. Samsung is a manufacturer for chips, screens and more. They literally manufacture Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors but that doesn’t mean they helped make them. Samsung makes screens to Apple’s specifications. *Apple* **engineered** the screens, and *Samsung* **makes** them. Just as Ricky Smith down at the factor didn’t design the Tesla Roadster, he just built it.

Bixby sucks just as much as Siri. Objectively, Google Assistant is the way to go on Android. Apple never claims innovation or claims to make certain things first. If you’ve ever watched any of their key notes, they just say they’ve done it the best, or found a way to make it better, or whatnot. Get over your fanboyism man.",2019-08-02 05:43:52

Now I'm fully into samsung products so I got this but I really like it..

Anyways for your question.. So far pretty sure no lags and I'm hitting it somewhat hard.. Like I multitask a lot (pdf and notes split screen along with calculator, internet and sometimes youtube in popup window) all without issues..

I also draw in autodesk sketchbook which is pretty smooth on even big canvases like 3000x4500..

Battery is also quite impressive.. I get anywhere from 9h sot (if I crank up the brightness to 70% (which is a lot with this thing..) to like 12h in span of day or even 3..

Now If I was you I would wait for a bit and get tab s6.. (It has even faster cpu 2gb more ram, 128gb base instead of 64gb, thinner bezels so overall a bit smaller with same display.. Spot on th3 back for s pen which now has bluetooth features.. And keyboard case is way better now if you decide to get one..

241,241,"Ok now we're talking..

I can tell that we are on the same page tho.. I always said that having small top bezel that will house everything is nest solution till they hide the camera under the display.. 

That's why I hated s10+ (especially.. since s10 is kinda fine but still dumb solution) Anyways s10+ hole is really big and it forces notf bar to be wide so you effectively lose all the space you got and while watching yt or something that space around camera means nothing really .. That design is cool for the first 2min and after that you're like ok but this is so pointless and dumb.. Bezel is much better solution ... 

I have n8 too and I love it.. if the chin and side bezels were smaller as well as slightly minimizing the top bezel that would be the perfect design in my eyes 👌🏽

And yeah lately upgrades are so small that I don't even buy every new phone (even tho I was crazy for em and was switching every year.. But tbh just 3y ago samsung phones wheren't even close to what they are now.. Like I had note edge and my friend had note 4 that phone got so laggy and battery got fucked after like one year of use and now I use almost 2y old n8 that still works flawlessly with very little lag and battery that is still quite impressive (4h sot and whole day of use which for 3300mah very used bat is pretty good) 

Now the note 10+ is gonna be huge upgrade from n8 bc it honestly does look much sexier (like sure that hole is not the best solution but I have to admit that I kinda like it and I don't think it'll be that distracting) and has bigger battery (which is for me the biggest thing) has under display fp scanner (also very big for me) and than other stuff like more ram more base storage better chip (which yeah I agree most people don't even need but I do some ps or drawing so I hope I'll notice some improvement) and also better cameras (the wide angle lens in particular)..

First of all, it was bought from a carrier (orange in Romania) fully unlocked because carriers here don't touch phones anymore, and because my mom extended her subscription (which she would have anyway), it got reduced to 480€ 
Then, we had a buy back voucher worth 160€ (I gave...a Galaxy Xcover 3, because another promotion said that if it was a Samsung Galaxy traded and you bought a phone from the S10 series you got an additional 150€)
Then, on the online store of said carrier, for every degree outside higher than 20°C you had a price cut of 1% at every product, but at 30°C you had 15% instead of the normal 10%
It ended up costing 850 Romanian lei, which via the Romanian Bank, today is 179.55€ and we also had a PrePay with 5€ credit on it :)",2019-08-04 02:39:18

Overall as my first fitness tracker it's petty good. In terms of battery life, if your using the watch significantly to track exercises, sleep and stream notifications then you get about 5 days of battery rather than the advertised 7. The heart rate tracking has no trouble reading my heart rate. The sleep tracking works well too. The display is really good on the Fit, colours are vibrant and the Amoled is nice. I found that the stress tracking is really just your heart rate when your it's now tracking an activity, i.e., doing press ups and then measuring your stress will read you as stressed. There are lots of widgets on the watch which show the weather, your calendar and let your add cups of water or caffeine. One disappointment is that you can't control your music natively and it requires buying an app, and if an app can let your Fit control music then I'm sure Samsung can implement a software update to add this. I have already received 3 software updates for my Fit though so Samsung are keen to adding and polishing features.

iPhone will release updates but remember they got caught by slowing the CPU for better battery life.  4 years iPhone lasted no longer than 2 years because of this issue.

I was thinking about the iPad because it's really cheap. Like $250 and I gotta buy a pen with it. 

As for the Samsung. They have a deal on their site, the keyboard, and the 64gb wifi tablet model for $500.

I just heard that the Samsung one was rivaling the pro so I was thinking maybe spending an extra hundred or two and getting the better one. 

I'm just sceptical of the Samsung one because I had the note 10.1. And that thing used to lag just trying to unlock the device. I initially had battery problems as well.",2019-08-04 06:55:26

Well for school purposes you gonna love this one.. I use it for the same thing basically (split screen of a book and notes or tasks and notes along with popup calculator and browser.. chat or whatever I need and it all works very fluidly) 

The keyboard deal is nice bc it's a good way to cary it like that and it's obviously nice to have keyboard for like essays or taking notes in class if you're allowed to do that (bc I think I'm not 🙄) 

What pro version? When? If it's based on android it's not worth the money I'll say that right away since android is limited in pro apps category that anything more powerful than mobil chips is pointless.. Like the good photoshop is struggle to find, in fact I use lightroom and adobe sketchbook to edit photos and sometimes I even need to take like android adobe photoshop to add extra blur or something... Also you can't edit videos or run visual studio to develop apps (which are all things that I would like to do on go but with android it's either limited or not possible..

Anyways for school and entertainment I would strongly recommend it.. Multitasking is very fluid and writing with pen is easy and comfortable (I can basically write as good and small as on paper even if I only use 2/3 of a display for the notes.. 
Also display is good size and high resolution and quality as well as brightness.. And finally battery life is also pretty good with at least 9+h of SOT no matter what.. 

Also I'm gonna recomend you a few apps to boost the multitasking experience...
1. You wanna hide the navigation bar and switch it up for gestures *this will give you full screen multitasking ability instead of part of the screen being taken by unnecessary bar

2. You wanna get multi star - which will bring back some multitasking stuff from previous system

3. Finally you wanna get task changer which will allow you to hold onto an app from recents and just drag it to left/right to multitask orr drag to centre of the screen to pop it up (and from recent you even like all apps icon and from there you can hold any app from your tablet and drag it into split screen or popup..

Both apps are made by samsung and are part of good lock app (that isn't available everywhere so if you don't have it just side load the apps you need (I can help you with that it's very simple and non harmful)",2019-08-04 07:14:00

I would advise making multiple fingerprint profiles of the same finger, as some people have dry/cracked skin and can affect performance but can be solved with multiple profiles, try doing your fingerprint at multiple angles also.

If you still have issues after this, type *#0*# into your phone keypad and tap sensor, then at the bottom do a normal scan. Let it run and see if they all pass. If any fail take to a Samsung service centre.

320,320,Ohhh ok. Will definitely look into that. That’s sounds like a really nice way to take advantage of Samsung pay. Thank you so much for your help. The Samsung rep just kept giving half answers to my questions but you really out done yourself over a trained Samsung employee lol. thanks again ;),2019-08-05 00:41:11

And tbh, if the starting space is 256GB, most people won't need an SD card seeing as 90% of the things can be streamed online. We are not living in the day and age of 16GB phones anymore, so stop acting like it's a required thing in a phone when you stream your music through spotify or w/e app you use, you watch youtube, you stream netflix, etc etc. Most people just don't need an SD card.

So instead of making these BS posts, go put your money where your mouth is and just buy an s10+ and gtfo while i and many others will enjoy the note.

365,365,"Hello!

I have a Samsung S10 Plus on Verizon. I upgraded from the Google Pixel earlier this year, and after doing an exhausting amount of research I decided to give Samsung a shot. 

I will admit I wasn't really a fan of Samsung devices, I used to work for AT&amp;T and while I was there we had a few issuees with some of the deivces we were carrying at that time. But, the S10 got great reviews, I had some tech savvy friends who all suggested I give it a whirl, so I bit the bullet.

So I have some issues, I dont know if its me, or if Im just being picky cuz I wasnt totally sold on it. (by the end of this you will also learn, I was COMPLETELY sold on my pixel, didnt go to the 3 cuz it was getting panned by all my go to tech sites...)

Issues:

MY SWYPE SUCKS!!!  Even the most basic words come out like total garbage, and on occasion my predictive text will ""predict"" that i have had a stroke, and words like ""predict"" will come out damn near different each time. I just swyped the word predict and I got precidentt, precent, percocet and president. I'll also add that the swype on my older tablet works fine. 

my voice chat  also sucks most of the time and puts out sentences that make absolutely no sense and sound NOTHING like what was said. I have no heavy or thick accent, slight new yorker, so its not like im confusing the system.

Forget about OK Google. I have to literally YELL at my phone for that to work, meanwhile my tablet, which is a 3 year old black friday deal model, picks up when i say OK Google from across the room. 

Has anyone else come across any of these Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus tech woes,  or is skynet simply out to get me?",2019-08-05 14:21:32
366,366,"Hi. I'm a new owner of the Samsung J3. It's a decent phone and I don't need a phone to do much, so it's fine for me. Well, it was.

After my phone updated to Android Pie my app notifications are either inconsistent or nonexistent. Before Pie, everything was cool. Now if I get a message thru Kik, I don't get a notification. I have to actually start the app and then magically the notification pops up. This also happens with other apps such as a game that came pre-installed. I have to open the app for most notifications to come through. And yet oddly ,some do. Some of the game notifications work, some don't. 

And yet Gmail and most of my text messages send notifications immediately. I have tried EVERYTHING. I've fiddled with phone notification settings, I've looked into the apps' own settings. I've even disabled Do Not Disturb. Nothing I have changed has made one iota of difference.

Had anyone else seen this with Android Pie? I've seen ppl complaining on a few other sites but I've yet to see anything that makes a difference.",2019-08-05 14:35:16

382,382,"I was literally in your boat about a month and a half ago. I actually came from a phone that was the size of the s10+ and almost bit the bullet but went with the s10e instead. It's just easier to hold, which is great for me because I'm clumsy and can accidentally drop my phone from time to time if it's too big. It's finger scanner is lightning fast and you'll know where it is every time, which helps with Samsung pass/pay. The 256GB actually has 8GB ram so it keeps up with the s10 and s10+. I personally haven't had the battery die on me yet and I play Pokemon Go and Wizards United daily, major battery drainers. The camera is all I need it to be and more. The screen is beautiful and I couldn't notice a difference between the 3 side by side in best buy. 

It's checks all the boxes and the value is great. I have no regrets. 

I hope this helps your decision. Cheers!",2019-08-05 20:23:20

A70 doesn't have wireless charging or an IP rating, but has a bigger battery and an on-screen fingerprint sensor. It has a mid-tier processor and has 3 cameras, not sure about their exact quality. the A70 is larger than the s10. 

I got my s10e the month of launch and I don't regret it. The size difference isnt that big compared to my s8 and the jump to the s10 wasn't worth it imo. I personally like feeling boujee so I like having flagship phones especially because I want it running well 2 yrs from now when I upgrade again, but the A70 is still a good phone.

An average phone only lasts 2 years before wearing out or feeling slow. The preorders offered $600 trade in and $50 Samsung store credit. This is on top of the usual goodies that are worth usually around $200-$300 to give to all preorders. So it's actually cheaper to upgrade yearly with a pre-order than every 2 years. Even waiting for Black Friday might get me $300 off but how much could I get a trade in for and no free promo gear? Also I don't have the ""I bought this phone on sale 6 months ago, now something new and shiny makes it look like trash and now I have to wait for it"".

Yeah that's true. But as a counter point I'd say the case has more recharges available. The air pods case offers an extra 24 hours. I think the galaxy buds only offer an extra 10(I could be wrong. I just remember its a lot less then air pods). 

I wasn't saying they don't have flaws. I agree almost completely with you on most of that. The only points I disagree on are the fit. At least in my personal experience air pods actually fit pretty nice and never fell out. 

I have both for a reason. I already had airpods from when I used my iPhone. I only got galaxy buds after I got my S10. I love the galaxy buds for music. But my weekly calls that I have to be on for work they're awful. Even after updates. And I've also have more random cut outs of sound on here then I ever have on airpods. If Samsung could address the call quality issues and the Bluetooth cut out issues I'd probably stop using my airpods completely.",2019-08-06 16:58:47

Now this year they're doing it again, except this time it's the Galaxy Watch Active. Next year we'll see a Galaxy Watch 2.

# Samsung SecretZone file encryption - Sorry, don't know where to go for help on this one...

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a drive with Samsung SecretZone encryption for a while. It came with a Seagate drive I purchased.

Since I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 I don't have access to all my important encrypted files.

I can't seem to find any information at all anywhere for this software!!!

The setup program won't install in Windows 10.

I  found Samsung's ""SecretZone UpdateTool""  which apparently runs a   program to update the \*.msr file (the encrypted data) to a new format.   This runs and finds my 2 original IDs (admin and guest) to sign in but   whichever one I pick doesn't matter because this software does not find   the msr files which are definitely there.

Even if it found them and updated the file format, what would open it if the original app doesn't run in Windows 10???

Does anyone have any clue of how to fix this or where to go for help?

I can't believe I can't find any resources!!!

Thank you",2019-08-31 16:55:28

Either wait for the S11 or... And I hope I don't get chewed out for this, but wait for the Pixel 4. That's basically the iPhone of Android phones. Straight from Google. Superb hardware. More then likely going to be a better camera then anything out there cause their software is so stupid optimized for their phones(really wish they'd make the G camera available for download as an app), and it gets the latest OS updates first and foremost. The cleanest version of Android you can get without anything on top of it, like One UI. Not to say One UI isn't bad but if you want the absolute best Android experience, I really don't think you can go wrong with either or. I don't feel like you'll get a lot out of the s10+ coming from the R. And the pixel 4 is literally like... 2 months away at max. Usually comes out in October.

46,46,"Sure. 

There are two reasons why iPad OS basically dashed my hopes for my iPad Pro.

1: iOS made sense as a choice for the iPad Pro because it was a pre-packaged OS designed to work really well with touch interfaces. It was very limited, but it did it's limited things quite well. If Apple had intended to fragment the OS to develop more useful productivity features, it would have made far more sense to create a special blend of MacOS that already supported virtually all professional grade software from the beginning. Instead, Apple will almost certainly create an enormous mess of the operating system as it tries to reverse-integrate features that it never anticipated having to deal with because it wasn't build around a desktop environment, meanwhile asking all third party developers in the world to create special iOS and iPad OS versions of their software. It's a huge ask.

&amp;#x200B;

2: iPad OS itself failed to impress me. It's still far behind Android, particularly Samsung's flavors with DeX, where productivity is concerned. It's half-hearted mouse support leaves a lot to be desired, things that a Galaxy S8 phone could easily outperform. You gain the ability to pin widgets, another antiquated Android feature. The text editing features seem like a confusing mess, which goes a bit to the design problems inherent mentioned in point 1. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, iPad OS fragmented iOS unnecessarily, showing that iOS was probably never the right choice for the iPad Pro whilst simultaneously losing most of the benefits of being part of iOS as it begins to distinguish itself over the next 5 or so years. Simultaneously, the real productivity enhancements are not where they need to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't to say the S6 or DeX is the clear answer--I guess it's to say that the Surface Pro is the real answer (or really, a desktop workstation). Computer professionals, with the possible exception of digital artists, still want to work in desktop environments because, well, desktop environments are way faster to work in. They were always built for productivity--they're the environments that develop other environments. Furthermore, Apple is still very anti-competitive when it comes to Windows environment connectivity (i.e. the most important one for professionals), failing even to allow third parties to create Continuity-esque applications while deciding not to pursue them on their own. While Apple intentionally kills their own PC-iPad connectivity, Android rapidly expands it, with Your Phone, Airdroid, Samsung Flow and DeX-over-Windows (or MacOS) connections, decisions that save me a great deal of time at work. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, the iPad Pro is and will remain a very good device to own, but it will be good at what it was always intended to do, which is basically a luxury Netflix browser or e-mail reader. As iPad OS attempts to figure out how to incorporate more desktop features, it will increasingly become a mess, and it will become more estranged from people who are already familiar with iOS, killing its principle advantage.",2019-08-31 21:36:23
47,47,"My coworkers use iPhone and they can't even get their photos out to share. They end up sharing the photos via email from iphone, and that so called smartphone sent the image reduced quality at 108 KB. To me Apple devices are just dumb and unnatural to use.

48,48,"So what exactly were you expecting?  You bought an Android phone apparently wanting Apple ecosystem integration? Did you also buy a Chromebook or Galaxy Tab or a Surface to replace a MacBook?  That is the level of idiocy you are laying out.  Do you expect to be taken seriously, or do you understand that you are coming off like a glorified troll?  Do you also understand there are people waiting for that device you never intended to keep?    

BTW, take the smoothness and optimization crap back to an iPhone subreddit where people actually believe it.  I use both and that garbage hasn't been true since the S8.  As for its biggest Achilles heel being it runs Android. Did you somehow miss that Samsung doesn't make IOS devices?  You needed to buy an expensive phone to demonstrate the \[blanking\] obvious?   

Now with respect to not matching Apple's ecosystem, that phone can interact with most Apple devices, other than the proprietary ones such as your watch.  It can also work with any and every Windows device on the market, without the need for something like iTunes.  That establishes Android, like Windows, as being an OS that extends across platforms, without restriction.  In fact, the phone you are returning is capable of running virtually on those other platforms, not that an iPhone offers anything genuinely comparable on a Mac. 

Use whatever phone you want. No one really gives a damn either here or in the land of iPhones.  If, however, you want to be an ass about it, expect to be treated accordingly.",2019-08-31 22:00:33
49,49,"&gt; I've never been interested in them simply because I feel my Note9 has better specs. 

Now I can't fully answer your question as this is my first Samsung device, but this simply isn't true looking at the specs page. 

Note 10+ has better processor, more RAM, larger battery, larger and newer display, better S-Pen with added features, up to 1TB microSD support, better camera with the cool AR/DepthVision tech at a hardware level, etc. 

I've seen people complain about the ultrasonic scanner but coming from the 6T (didn't have issues with that one either), this thing is a miracle and using it with the display off is extremely helpful. You also mention not wanting to lose a headphone jack and dedicated fingerprint sensor while spending $300 more, yet you're thinking about a Pixel 4? 


As for the last thing you're forgetting, those people can trade in their Note 9 and get a Note 10+ for $499 directly from Samsung. That's more than you can get for a local sale without the local sale hassle, and you're upgrading to the latest Note device if you wish to do so.",2019-08-31 22:04:40

51,51,"After using Android for most of my life, I used iPhone 8 Plus for 1 year, and I really hated it.

- Can't download files from the internet such as mp3.

- Can't share files between app easily. For example, I can't share photos from my Google Photo to Reddit. I had to download to my iphone before I could post it. On Android, you can post almost anything from any app as long as it is applicable. 

- There is no file management. I feel like I am not the owner of my own contents. On Android,  your files are yours to move around, and access with ease. With iPhone, I had to use iTune. If I find a tune I like on the internet, I can't download directly to my phone and make it my ringtone. I would need to download on a PC, then plug in iPhone and sync the tune.

- Storage management on iPhone is basically useless. It shows my storage is eating up by some apps, but no way to clear it or view what is it.

- iCloud is 5 GB. It is technically useless unless you pay. 

- The included charger is 5W, basically unchanged since forever. I had to use my Samsung charger for faster charging. Unless you pay more to get a faster charger.

- Quick setting is not actually quick. You have to go to setting manually if you want to select anything. 

- No multitasking, no back button. Sometimes the apps frozen, there was no way to go back 1 step because no back button. You have to close the wholething.

- When someone calls you, that calling screen pops right at you with no respect to what you are doing.

90,90,Lol this is so funny I mean I love Samsung products and respect apples. But in my experience a lot of iPhone 7 users antennas have broken from the iPhone 10r 10s and 10s Max's updates on the phone and apple hasn't been replacing those. They tell our customer there's nothing wrong with the phone even though they can't connect to the internet or get calls texts etc. Idk in my experience I've never had issues with my Samsung products after having them for years. The only iPhone I've had that's survived since day one was the 6 which for its time I'll admit was an awesome phone. (My girl currently is using it) But I see way more apple phones have problems than any Android phones not counting the users fault but I'm biased because Samsung is my homie👌,2019-09-01 19:10:25

92,92,"Generally speaking I think that Beats are not the best quality headphones in the world. They sound alright. I own Galaxy Buds, Solo 3, Studio 3, PowerBeats Pro, and recently sold my AirPods 2 to a family member.

With that being said, I definitely recommend the Studio 3 headphones over the Solo 3s if you absolutely want Beats branded over the ear headphones. HOWEVER, there are far superior headphones that are better than Beats in all areas for similar pricing.

As much as I don't like Beats after spending money on their headphones, I have to say that the **PowerBeats Pro** are very good. They are super comfortable, sound very nice, and they have great battery life. If you want good in-ear headphones I can always recommend those (they're a bit over priced).

When it comes to Galaxy Buds, I like them but I don't love them. They are headphones that I keep laying next to my laptop to use them when I'm getting some work done at home. Overall, they're a solid option and when paired with a Samsung phone, they add some good functionality.

Since you are comparing in-ear to over the ear headphones I'll rate the headphones out of 5 stars. My rating takes into consideration: build, sound quality, battery life, connectivity, and comfort for prolonged listening time as well as versatility of headphone uses.

* **Studio 3** 3 stars
* **Solo 3** 2.5 stars
* **PowerBeats** 4.5 stars
* **Galaxy Buds** 3.5 stars
* **Air Pods** 3.5 stars",2019-09-01 19:19:15

With that said, you have to remember that Apple products are a unison of Hardware and Software working as one. 

I saw a video a few days ago comparing a brand new Galaxy Note 10+ to an iPhone XS Max, the problem is that's last year's iPhone, literally a year old, and the iPhone was still faster with 4gb of RAM and last year's A12 versus 12 GB of RAM and a new Snapdragon

The fact of the matter is the iPhone simply does more with less, it's optimized better that's why 4 year old iPhones still run good as new and aren't all janky.

Android's answer is always to throw crazy specs at the phone as an attempt to overcome the unoptimizations.

181,181,"Damn son, you really splurged and got it all, didn't you? I'm thinking of either getting the Samsung Galaxy Fold or the new iPhone 11 Pro or whatever it'll be called. 
I've used both iOS and Android extensively, and I really want a foldable phone, but I'm also really tired of the disjointed eco system (or lack of an eco system) on Android and also even though One UI is _fine_, I don't love the look of it, and the gesture navigation feels less refined than, let's say OnePlus or Xiaomi's gesture navigation. Don't even know if the Fold has the gestures either, I've only ever seen reviewers use the old nav buttons which is even more boring to me. 

With the Fold I am also worried about how the screen will age, because I figured I might enter some sort of Samsung Upgrade program if I were to get it, but if the screen gets scratched up so easily I'm wondering how much they vill deduct in value from it when you return it.

With the Note 10+ I'm just not sure what I think, it's such a beautiful phone but I still wasn't impressed with it, and I had both the S9/S9+, Note 9 and S10 earlier, and I do like Samsung but I usually find myself wanting to upgrade really fast when I use Samsung phones even if they still are good and can last for quite a while.",2019-09-03 00:48:49
182,182,I've never used the 1+ but in regards to apple and samsung they each are great products in their own respects. If you have a macbook and dont really use the apple ecosystem I would say it doesn't hurt to try some other phones and see what you like. I've always found myself searching on youtube for comparison videos to get a better idea. Sounds like android may offer you some better options based on what you've said.,2019-09-03 01:26:46

After calling Best Buy and Samsung all day and getting order statuses of ""ready for pickup"" then ""shipping"" then ""preparing to ship"" back and forth over and over, and everyone at Samsung and Best Buy saying ""I don't know"" to every question I asked, I finally got the truth. 

I eventually got through to a woman at Best Buy headquarters somewhere in the East (I live on the West Coast) and she told me ""let's check the status..... your phones have been waiting at your local Best Buy for a week now.""     ?!?!?!?

She then explained that somebody at Best Buy corporate headquarters messed up and mixed up all of the serial numbers nation-wide on all the new pre ordered Note 10 / Note 10+ s with their respective customers and that is why nobody is getting their phones (or they already have gotten it late). FINALLY the truth comes out!!!

This lady deserves a huge raise for telling the TRUTH and actually giving me some kind of actual information for once

So every time I check the status now and hear from a Best Buy employee or someone else that the phones aren't in yet, I'll be sure to tell them what is actually happening because either they were lied to by their supervisors or they are lying themselves. 

Still have no idea on when this mess will be sorted out (she said probably by September 10), but I at least finally think I know what is going on now. Best Buy should definitely hook us up for their massive screw-up and all of the torture and waiting we've went through.

I took off tomorrow, from work,  since that was the original delivery date, according to fedex. And come to find out, it never shipped. Only a label was created. On top of that Samsung customer really could care less. I don’t know how many times I’ve called. And they all state “Yeah it’s backordered, you have to wait till it comes” . I would have never pre ordered this phone back on Aug 13, if I knew of this big headache, that it would cause.",2019-09-03 17:19:19

317,317,"(copied from a previous post I made a few days ago, because I'm lazy)

The first thing I noticed was the size of the tablet itsself, it's a lot smaller than I was expecting. The next thing was how much screen Samsung have managed to fit into such a small form factor.

I've not had much time to really use it today, but as far as speed/performance go, it'll be right up there with the S/Note 10. I opted for the 256GB model with 8GB of storage, purely because it wasn't that much extra money in the grand scheme of things, and almost seems like good value (if anything can truly be 'good' value when it costs the better part of a grand.

The screen is exactly what you'd expect, good colours, nice responsiveness (one thing which worried me was how responsive the pen would be when writing, as it's only a 60Hz display - thankfully it's great), it gets fairly bright, but I'm currently locked out of my house and typing this in the garden on an overcast day, and it's only just bright enough with almost no headroom left.

I did notice while walking with it in my hand or tucked under my arm that becuase it's very dense it does get  a bit tiring, and can be slightly cumbersome to carry for long distances. I'd recommend putting it into a bag or something.

I'm typing this using the keyboard case and I've got say it's much more useable than I expected. The keys are the right sort of shape to hit one one by one (no accidentally pressing three at once) and the trackpad integration seems really god so far. I had a little play around with DeX while on the bus, so didn't really use it, but it's very easy to switch in and out of it.

The cameras seemed a little pointless on paper, but having used them I can see the appeal of just snapping a shot of a piece of paper on your tablet and writing on it the S pen rather thah getting your phone out and having to bluetooth it to yourself. The images it takes are fairly low resolution, but they still look pretty good in all the other ways that matter - realistically, the sorts of people who think it's socially acceptable to take pictures on a tablet will buy something cheaper like a Tab A, or FireHD8.

Finally, the feature that swung it for me and made me decide to actually buy this beatiful thing - the S pen. It's comfortable in the hand, if a little oddly shaped (you get used to it basically immediately), the magnetic charging is a really nice feature, and it was fully charged within minutes, and hasn't dipped much below 100% yet today. Drawing/writing is a smooth experience and feels really nice - the pressure sensitivity is really good and allows you very fine control over your 'brushstroke'. The case also hides the pen very nicely and holds it securely - I wish I'd realised the case had a large adhesive part before I shoddily applied it and had to peel it off (which took a lot of force, this thing isn't falling off any time soon).

Minor issues: the backspace/delete key is in a slightly odd place, and the Fn+DeX combo uses the full reach of one hand for me (from C3 to D4 on a piano). Caps lock has randomly been on by default a few times. I had to spend a good half hour updating everything out of the box (not that this is unusual). I can't seem to change the two finger scroll direction on the trackpad. I've not had a great experience with the fingerprint scanner either - I might try adding the same thumb in landscape and portrait modes (face unlock has been damn-near instant, but you still have to swipe to open the tablet even after it's unlocked).

I haven't had a chance to test the speakers or the video watching experiene as a whole, but honestly that's not somthing I'll be using this tablet for. It cost more than my laptop, and honestly I prefer this keyboard (despite the annoyingly small left shift key), it feels like the best 'netbook' ever created. The keyboard simply pulls off and you can use it as a standalone tablet (this is nice becuase the roughness of the back half of the case gives you something extra to grip - the metal feels premium, and I'd much rather have that than glass on a tablet, but it's very smooth.",2019-09-04 12:50:03

330,330,"Ask any retailer and they will be happy to explain:

1) Samsung offers steep discounts out of the gate.  This undercuts the value of the device since it is easy to figure out the ""suggested retail"" game where that is only really the price for really foolish people.

2) Most android phones either aren't that expensive to start or, well, come off as cheap. 

3) Android is horribly fragmented and Android phones are not expected to be updated for five years. As a result, many (probably most) aren't designed to last that long. 

4) Like them or not, Apple produces products that look premium, last longer, and will be updated for five years.  Their marketing is also far more sophisticated (and effective).  That gives them the image of premium in a sea of ""cheap"" devices. 

5) Apple does not really discount it products in the same was any Android OEM.  They offer discounts but they are within a formula and otherwise often do have people buying at sticker price.  Microsoft does the same thing with Surface products.  If you pay attention, you know the discount cycle. Between that cycle you pay the full price.  Samsung seemed to be moving that direction but its discounts on S10s and Note 10s suggest they are simply going back to the Android approach with a higher starting price. 

As to how this works out in the real world, I sold my iPhone XR for more than I actually paid (had some credits so it was well under $500 and I sold it for $500 in only a few days.  I also sold my Apple Watch for only $50 less than I paid last year.  When I dumped the Xr (which I hated) and switched to a S10e, my actual cost was less than $100.  When I traded that in on a Note 10, between the $600 trade and more than $100 in additional discounts, it cost me less than $250 to get the Note 10.

481,481,"Personally, before this launched I preferred the design of the Active Series 1 over the Galaxy Watch, but the lack of a rotating bezel was too much of a downgrade for me. This one having a haptic bezel is a great development, but not sure how it will affect battery life and durability in the long term.

I think coming from the Huawei, any of the smaller variants (including the Active Series 1) would be too much of a downsize for you (unless you want that!)

Either the Galaxy Watch 46mm or the Active Series 2 44mm would be great. The Active (pictured) is much more sleek, modern and lightweight, whilst being brighter and more vivid. But the GW is more durable and more traditional

HOWEVER...

There may be a _slight_ change of pace and/or learning curve when coming from Android WearOS to Samsung Tizen! You won't have the same app store or interface, and things like watch faces and preferences aren't transferrable.

Its just pretty to look at and people will like to chose that over any other phone.

and oneplus phones are very great! the cameras arent going to be on par with any flag ship on the market right now but its really great camera non-theless and will suit anyones needs.

14,14,"I currently run a Note 10+ and an iPhone 11 Pro. The Note is amazing for media consumption. Android does really well with PiP and Split and the large screen is phenomenal for it. Also, for my setup file management is easier on the Note. Want to d/l Usenet, Torrents or files from your Plex server no problem as Android allows background task running. Also, a lot more choices for the apps on Android. You also have the option of expandable storage so you can sync more content.

My iPhone is my choice for my social media apps and photography. I find taking and editing pictures more pleasant on iOS. Plus, the quality and quantity of the editing apps combined with iOS color management across apps is superb. For these cases I prefer Apple for its background app management. I get rock solid consistent battery on the go. Where with Android it can be unpredictable. When I first switched I just uploaded my iCloud photos to Google Photos and then deleted the iCloud library backup and turned it off. Kept an archived copy on my server just in case. Now everything just gets backed up to Google and then within Google photos I use the free up device storage after the backup is finished.

If you’re like me and really into tech and open minded to both platforms I think you’ll really enjoy it. For support, as a tech literate person, I just learned to figure it out on my own.

However when I go to turn on the uhd color setting for input 1 the screen goes black for 5 seconds then is unable to find the Xbox’s signal. I have a new 2.0 hdmi cable and have enabled 4K and hdr on the Xbox. I’ve also tried toggling YCC 4:2:2 on and off. I’ve reset the tv to factory settings, swapped hdmi inputs and make sure the firmware is up-to-date. 

Has anyone encounter this before? At the point I’m assuming it’s a hardware issue unless anyone knows additional settings I can adjust. 

Also does anyone know what the process of repairing a tv out of warrant is like? I’ve had a Samsung tv for the past 10 years and despite the lack of hdr still love the tv. Fingers crossed I can get thus fixed!

Google make a fortune from both the tracking of everything you do, which they sell and give you no cut and play store.  Every app they sell they take a wedge of that sale.  Every company would like to get a chunk of this action because it is a cash cow.  

You wouldn't believe how much your data is worth.  Your personal data is sold to companies constantly.  This is why, if you look at videos for Samsung buds your Facebook feed will suddenly have audio equipment ads.  Those audio companies pay for information for anyone looking to buy audio equipment.  

I would prefer to see this market fragmented too.  I know whoever we use will exploit us, but it's nice to be able to choose who you want to do the exploiting.  Google are up to some very dubious practices now.  Working with the governments of countries that both imprison and murder dissidents, religious groups, anyone who opposes them etc.

2. Call quality is muffled when it is used by the inner mic or in a louder space, and is a big mystery as to the fix of this issue. Samsung would never release a product that would consistently not work properly, and in the UNPACKED event, it was explicitly told that call quality with the inner mic would make the other person in the call easily heard. I plan on figuring out on how to get the best call quality with the Galaxy Buds in a loud space.

3. The bass can get better if you get the Comply tips specifically for the Galaxy Buds which reduce external noise hearing. You can also use the Wearable app to add more bass in your sounds. For optimal sound settings, I would try using the most correct eartips possible.

4. I have been having some issues with connections cutting out and the only fix is to change the Bluetooth Audio Codec to Scalable, but the problem is that the setting always resets back to SBC.

Kind of like if Sony's camera department had been talking to their smartphone dept, they'd have the best cameras (Sony's camera dept purposely withheld innovations from the phone dept because they were afraid of cannibalized sales).

Apple on the other hand has everything integrated from the start. They designed the Apple TV to work with Apple devices, mainly because they designed it

Samsung is just recently moving into the whole one smart home ecosystem thing with their Smart Things. Basically they used to be like Sony, but only now are moving into emulating what Apple did but isn't there yet, but they can't just link everything together just like that at the snap of a finger. 

The Airpods and Sennheisers likely use industry standard protocols, but from what I could tell from the Galaxy Buds they're designed to work with the Galaxy phones and that's it. They didn't take into account the Smart TVs when their audio people designed it. In this respect the Samsung Level audio gear would have worked better with the TV since those use industry standards AFAIK.",2019-10-01 19:20:34

The other example I gave, Sony, has their camera department refusing to work with their smartphone department. It took a new CEO to force them to do it.

At the top, Samsung does not work like Apple because they make everything from carbon nanotubes to friggin tanks for the Korean military. Samsung's mobile division has to talk to the TV division first. It really can't be compared because these are two different approaches.",2019-10-01 19:53:44

Samsung apps are feature rich, sync to Google, Microsoft and Firefox, and are very well integrated.

Personally I use mostly Samsung apps. 

The Samsung browser, for example, is way better than Chrome. It uses Chromium engine, has a better night mode (no sudden bright white loading/splash screens), anti tracking/ad blocking extensions, and can sync bookmarks to any Chromium based browser or Firefox on a desktop/laptop. It can also be used as the device assistant with a customizable search engine of choice. 

Google Photos is great in it has unlimited photo backup. I don't use it personally because I realize I'll just end up with a metric ton of photos there. I keep them just backed up on Samsung cloud so I can better manage them from growing too many and delete from time to time. Samsung cloud only keeps a copy of the ones on the phone though, so if you delete it from the phone it's gone forever. I manually separate photos I want to keep into my PC.",2019-10-02 02:25:12

Problem is that at the center they told me that it doesn't matter that I bought my phone just a couple of months ago, my warranty is not valid anymore because when they opened the phone they found this little Blue sticker.
I don't speak Chinese of course (I live and am in Italy) and I don't know if they do, but they told me that this writing means ""unauthorized repair"" so basically they think I had already broken my phone before and I got it repaired by someone else.
But uhm, this is false? How is it possible that this sticker was inside my phone?",2019-10-02 04:45:07

One of my favourite features is the fingerprint scanner on the side. Coming from Sony phones I am used to and prefer it.

There's a lot of optimisation that needs to be done on your end to be able to get 5-6 hrs SOT. The most I've had is 6. The worst part of this phone is the Standby time kills battery.

I have everything off - AOD, Sync (I just sync my Gmail myself), location (rip rewards), low brightness with a max of 40% which is plenty bright anyway and 20-0% at night, a lot of the gestures like lift to wake etc, Samsung edge turned off, whatever I can turn off that isn't useful or I need really. Can't think of anything more ATM.

I always keep my phone topped up during the day anyway as I'm usually always near a charger. 

Other than the battery optimisation, the phone is near perfect. I love the size and the screen is absolutely killer for a 1080p panel, the AMOLED makes it pop on a device so small. Performance is great, even when I sometimes run medium power mode to preserve battery.",2019-10-02 17:45:14

186,186,"Galaxy buds are amazing!  I've used Bose Soundsport and airpods 1 + 2, and buds are amazing ... but it depends on what you want.

If you want to wear white obvious headphones everywhere that make you look like you don't want to talk to anyone in public, airpods may be more your speed.  Also, airpods don't encapsulate sound very much, they're pretty loose in the ear, so wearing them everywhere is possible because someone can talk to you and you can hear them.

Samsung buds on the other hand encapsulate very well.  The rubber nub on the earbud keeps the sound in very well, and makes it hard for your experience to be disturbed by ambient noise, and even loud noise.  For this reason, there is a setting that lets the bud mix in ambient sound while you're using them (through the existing mic on the bud) which makes it LESS encapsulated, but only when you choose.  They're also quite inconspicuous when in your ear.  

The Bose soundsport were great but VERY conspicuous, like a Borg Headset ... and the airpods, well ... yeah.",2019-10-02 19:39:46

•Quality of Instagram stories is not as good as on iOS(maybe Instagram will stop being lazy and optimize the compression by then) 

•Don't expect the same feel/fluidity, smooth animations (not saying Android isn't smooth, if you've used a Windows PC and compared it to a Mac yea it's like that..... Also the s11 is rumored to use a 90hz panel, if true then that will compensate and make it comparable to iOS' fluidity) 

•Cameras are great but from what I've seen(through friends phones compared to mine) skin tones/human subjects definitely look better on the newer iPhones (s11 is gonna focus on cameras next year so we'll have to see what Samsung delivers with the new tech) 

•If you're locked into the apple ecosystem then it's gonna be quite difficult to switch

191,191,"It depends. If you're a casual phone user that uses their phone for basic stuff like social media, youtube, netflix, reddit, internet browsing, and other basic stuff you should stick to iPhone. The IOS experience is very oriented to the ""it just works"" and chooses what they think is best for you whereas Android is oriented to the ""here are all these options, do whatever you want"". From factory settings, my s10 was default on 1080p and I had to up it myself to 1440p. My dad or mom would not know about this or even how to change it. 

If you're into using your phone like a computer, then Samsung is perfect for you. You get so much options and customization but that comes with its cons. You're not sure which is the best, so a lot of research is spent finding out. I've been using Samsung since s3 and I still learn things all the time about Samsung phones since it's a new experience every new Samsung phone. I love my Samsung though since I'm very tech savvy and I have it set up to do numerous things. I have my spotify playlists on my home screen as quick launch icons.

However, I've had a couple non tech savvy friends come over to Samsung and they've enjoyed the experience still. Maybe ask a Samsung friend to walkthrough you his phone? I was able to convince my friends to join like that. If you're able to take the time to fully utilize Samsung and the android software, you'll have a great time.

2) What some jackass pontificator on the internet says about space needs to be taken with the same grain of salt as everything else said by jackass pontificators on the internet. There is more to assessing space then going ""oh, I opened the phone and it looks like there is space.""

3) Based upon industry trends, a reasonable opinion would be there isn't a snowball's chance in Phoenix of there being a headphone jack in the S11.  It isn't just the phone design (which is still speculative) that needs to be considered.  They spun their marketing to discount the headphone jack and you can expect a united front on the flagships going forward.  Given robust Note sales, which are better than the past couple models, there is no reason to expect back tracking.  

4) Whether it is a Samsung flagship or an iPhone, they are all precisely engineered devices.  Armchair engineers can blather on to their heart's content but that doesn't make everything marketing BS just because they say so.",2019-10-03 13:47:39

236,236," The Battery of Note 10: The talk-time of Note 10 dissected for you!

Samsung Note 10 is the latest Samsung product that came into the market last year. The product was hailed as groundbreaking by the Samsung company because of its stronger RAM, processing power and the ability to give the user a strong experience. But now, the product has to be vetted for one major factor, and that is, the battery of Samsung Note 10. The Samsung Note 10 has a battery life of 9 to 10 hours a day and is considered some of the highest battery times the brand has provided in recent history. Now, here we come with the breakdown of various other time frames that are significant in assessing the quality of the product. 

**LTE 2.0Gbps:**

Samsung launched the Exynos 9 Series 9820 Processor that takes the 2.0 Gbps LTE Advanced Pro Modem that the company is taking great pride in. The product has the neural processing unit (NPU) which is a greatly advanced processing system. Android works with the artificially intelligent system that focuses on the intelligent learning of the patterns that the person follows and developing an android’s behavioral pattern that will cater to the user’s pattern of thinking. This will make sure that the device runs smoothly and will also troubleshoot issues that occur due to over usage of the same few features over and over again. 

**PROCESSOR 7nm:**

NM in this context is nanometer, the thickness of the transistors used in the androids is of 7nm and the product will have the 7nm of transistor capacity. This will make the CPU considerably powerful and will make the product easier to use. The processing power means that even though the product has multiple heavy-handed features, the processor can handle the burden and will make the product quickly. The Note10 has been in the market for a year now and the product does not hang that often. 

**RAM 12GB:** 

The RAM in [Note 10 plus](https://www.erosdigitalhome.ae/samsung-galaxy-note10-plus-6-8-inch.html?utm_source=SEO&amp;utm_medium=reddit.com&amp;utm_campaign=Note10-3-Oct-2019#e_var_color=982&amp;e_var_capacity=956) is 12 GB and this is the main reason that the device has such power. Usually, the products cannot even offer a 10GB RAM of processing speed by the Processor with 7nm of transistor potential combined with the 12 GB of RAM will give you a device that will run like a horse. No matter how heavy your products are, you will have a successful device that does not hang up usually. 

**Internal Storage:** 

The device has an internal storage of 512 GB that is a stronger internal storage capacity than most of the laptops and computers that are available in the market. The reason is that the internal storage in this device is designed to allow the user to download heavy tv shows and similar content so that they can enjoy the content on the Hi-definition android. 

These are the main reasons you should have Note 10 on your next shopping list. This is a great product for you and your family. Share your thoughts in the comments section.",2019-10-03 20:49:29
237,237,"I agree with all of this except a couple...

2. This is probably lucrative for Samsung. In a way it's free advertising",2019-10-03 21:31:54
239,239,"Hi! Thanks for the reply. One thing holding me back is that the keyboard case Samsung makes seems to be junk. Reviews say the magnets aren't very strong and it wobbles around when closed, which is not a good look. 

That said, the extra RAM would be nice, the thinner and lighter design would be nice, and I am so over the iris scanner that the fingerprint reader would be heavenly.

*****
&gt; SEOUL - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd has ended mobile telephone production in China, it said on Wednesday, hurt by intensifying competition from domestic rivals in the world&amp;#039;s biggest smartphone market.

&gt; The shutdown of Samsung&amp;#039;s last China phone factory comes after it cut production at the plant in the southern city of Huizhou in June and suspended another factory late last year, underscoring stiff competition in the country.

&gt; The South Korean tech giant&amp;#039;s ceased phone production in China follows other manufacturers shifting production from China due to rising labor costs and the economic slowdown.

290,290,Batteries on the Samsung flagships don't last long enough for many customers. Thus there are complaints and discussions on how to optimize battery life. Other brands (e.g. Apple) arguably have better technology and the battery lasts longer.,2019-10-04 15:10:37

292,292,"The A series (Galaxy Alpha, Galaxy A5/7/9 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018) prior to the A*xx* series were using metal chassis, had samsung pay, and were up to IP68 water resistant (others had IP56 afaik).

The A series were their testbed for implementing new features before being ported to the flagship ones.

But ever since competition in the midrange got stiffer, other phones in the range especially ones from the Chinese market, were offering dual or triple camera, big memory and powerful graphics, all while in a plastic body without any IP rating and people were picking them up, thus Samsung realizing that maybe these were not necessary on the mid range lineup.

That's why they refreshed the midrange lineup and offered the A*xx* series as the upper midrange while the M*xx* series were the lower/budget lineup.

Also, I guess it is hard to implement water resistance when using plastic. I mean, the S5 had it before but it was not fully sealed still since the plastics flex too much.",2019-10-04 15:19:58

295,295,"I don't know your routine/much information from this post, and potentially you have a faulty battery, but I will say, coming from an iPhone to Samsung, it's likely you need to have a proper deep look into your phone settings and see what is going on...

On an iPhone, things tend to be managed a certain way by iOS but Android gives you a lot more customisation and choice... Because of this, you should check certain things that you might want more control over, for example, what apps are running heavy in the background and killing your standby time?

You should be able to manage permissions and turn off any unnecessary processes to save up some battery life. If you go really hard into cutting off features (some people don't want to) you can make a phone last a lot longer on a single charge.

Make sure and check that no apps have sneakily ended up in the Device Maintenance &gt; Battery &gt; Unmonitored Apps section, because I've know some heavy apps to end up here (not sure how or why) and they're then allowed to eat away at your battery without any warning",2019-10-04 15:49:31

2. That would be nice to see, so long as battery life doesn't suffer. High refresh phones are notorious for poor battery life. 
3. Again, not something that will come back. They've had this for several generations now, AFTER a ""beta test"" with the S6 and S7. To go backwards on their design principles would be a bad look. 
4. Pretty sure 45W is the fastest in any phone right now. And the 25W (I think?) Included in the box is already insanely fast. Not sure what else you're expecting here. 
5. Also gone for good. And the prevalence of smart TVs make the IR blaster even less relevant. Samsung doesn't want you to use an IR blaster, they want you to hook up the Smart Things remote via Wifi. Getting rid of the IR blaster is another step towards their IoT goals.",2019-10-04 21:38:27

Still, the Note 10+ is currently a great choice and of course, still rather new. 

If you can hold out, which to me it sounds like you can then hold out or if you cannot hold out then just bite the bullet and get the note 10+.

1)There is link to windows 
2) Samsung dex

1) Link to windows: allows all my notifications to come to my phone and i can mirror my phone. Reply  to text as well. This is done by downloading the my companion app on Microsoft store. The app is already preinstalled in the note10 as part of the partnership with Microsoft.

Goal: to create similar experience for android users just like iphone and macbook.

2) Samsung Dex: more of a semi-virtual computer. More so as using your phone as a makeshift computer.
Tip: from my experience(owner of the Samsung notebook9 pro 2019), dex is better using a monitor than a laptop. For those curious, i use the Samsung $89.99 multiport adapter.

Goal: pc portable computing. 

Similarities of Dex and Link to Windows:
- both can see notifications
- both can receive files
-both can send/reply messages

Funny enough, I saw a side-by-side picture comparison of the Note10 and iPhone 11 Pro on Twitter the other day the one I liked more and thought might be the iPhone(because of how much praise Apple gets about their camera) was actually the Note10.

477,477,"honestly I have fun with OneUI because of the themes you can get from the samsung store. Themes change your wallpaper, AOD, icons, call screen and keyboard colours. I change them out monthly and it makes me happier to use my phone.",2019-10-06 19:04:56
478,478,"My school has Samsung Smart TVs, so whenever I have to do presentations I just screen mirror from my phone. Compared to iOS, the fact that I can store and manage files like PowerPoints and Word documents make my life a lot easier. My phone now also acts as a mini laptop of sorts. We share files quite often, so Samsung's link sharing helps a lot too, together with the USB-reading capabilities.

What I've been very pleased with lately though is Samsung DeX. This feature is insane. It makes everything so seamless, and whenever I find myself at a place without any internet connection I can use DeX instead of a hotspot. Using mobile hotspot for a laptop is horrible for me because it wastes all my data.

I haven't really used the S-Pen all that much, but it's a feature I'd rather have and not need than need and not have. It has its moments.",2019-10-06 19:13:34

To give some background, you can arrange one of these 'Doorstep Repairs' through Samsung's website. They do all the latest S and Note devices and tablets. (All the way back to the S5 and Note 4) as well as some A and J devices. All you have to do to get a quote is your postcode. They use genuine parts. Normally a screen replacement for a Galaxy Note 9 is £229 (a free battery replacement is included) but I managed to win a competition on the Samsung Members app where I received a screen replacement using doorstep repairs for free. Now the booking experience is quite simple, you can select multiple things to be repaired, like the screen, cameras, battery (by itself), ear piece speaker, back glass and the charging port. You can select any weekday to get a repair but do note that you cannot chose a time slot (more on that). After booking my doorstep repair I waited until the day of the repair, where at 8am I received both an email and a text message from WeFix informing me of the hour time slot for my repair, as well as the name of the technician who would be repairing my device. So I waited a few hours until about 11am (about in the middle of the time slot I was given) and the technician arrived in his van. (The vans are quite easy to spot as they have WeFix and lots of information on every side - it's not just a plain white van). The technician was quite friendly and inspected my device quickly before taking it back to his van and repairing it. The whole repair took about an hour, with the screen and the battery being tested. As well, my device was tested to make sure it was still water resistant. When I received my device back, I inspected it myself and it was done brilliantly. Another nice touch is that a plastic screen protector was also applied (and quite precisely) which is good because my screen was previously scratched a fair bit. I also received a discount code that would take 10% off any future repair through WeFix. Overall, the experience and the repair were very good and I would recommend them to anyone who wishes to have their Samsung device repaired. However, one negative of the experience was the amount of emails I received after the repair, about 4 or 5 I got in total after about a day or two afterwards. These emails were all about recommending and reviewing WeFix. I wouldn't mind one or two but 5 is excessive and quite irritating. If you want any further clarification on anything or have any questions, I will try my best to answer them and I hope you found this helpful and a little bit informative.

The buds are fantastic if you're using a galaxy phone, I've had no issues with using them. They're by far the most convenient pair of buds out there for a galaxy phone. The features are fantastic too: wireless charging, a voice-enhancing hear through feature and built in voice assistant makes these fantastic for daily use. I tend to leave my phone in my bag and just use the voice assistant to control everything. The price: they're dirt cheap obviously, around 100 - 120 euros last I checked, provided you're not actually buying them directly from Samsung. Can't complain about the price. The bad: the sound. As much as I love them, and as much as I use them, I would not recommend them as a main pair of earbuds. They don't support the AptX codec. They sound better using Dolby Atmos, barely.

I also wear my phone at work and it's great to quickly view notifications on my watch rath aser than pulling my phone out. You can also reply to messages on platforms like WhatsApp and messenger, it has a to format of text, but I don't particularly like that. One of the major downsides for me is the battery life. I get maximum of 2 days usually, and it takes about 2 hours to charge. This can be annoying, particularly for me when I may work a triplet of 13 hour shifts with a run after each shift... I sometimes completely forget it needs charging, and I ideally want at least 30 percent before I go out on a run.

It\'s nice to be able to clearly read what a notification says. \\- A little easier to see in direct sunlight than the Charge 3. Still not perfect. \\- Heart rate and step count accuracy seems comparable to my Charge 3. Whew! \\- **Synching/notifications work flawlessly** (with my Pixel 3a). Changing a clock face is instantaneous. Vibrations are strong. \\- ""Do Not Disturb"" mode, ""Good Night"" mode, both easily accessible from band. No hunting around for hard-to-find settings on tracker or app. \\- Can set display brightness from 1-10 on tracker. \\- I really like the Samsung Health app. I particularly like that it actually tells me what it is doing when it is synching. It tells me what data it is downloading from the device. Very nice to see instead of Fitbit\'s useless ""progress bar."" \\- The band auto-detected ""workouts"" when I was walking and mowing the lawn. Very nice. Couldn\'t select ""mowing lawn"" as a workout category, though. \\- Not sure if this is a pro or con, but the display turns on when you make an arm movement that is anywhere close to lifting your hand to your face. The Fitbit Charge 3 was the opposite -- sometimes I had to make an exaggerated arm movement just to get the display to turn on. &amp;#x200B; **Galaxy Fit Cons:** \\- Poor battery life so far. Just 3 days with HR set to ""Always"". Looks like maybe 4-5 days with it set to ""Frequent"" (every 10 minutes when not working out). Must have to turn off notifications to get the advertised ""about a week."" \\- Band is not particularly comfortable, and is very hard to adjust tighter, once you\'ve got it on. Easier just to take it off and start over. Worried about durability of band due to having to fold the end ""under"" when putting it on. People with small wrists might not like this band. \\- Although there are many variations of clock faces to choose from, they\'re not customizable. You have to pick your poison from the available 24 choices. Get ready to see some pinks/yellows/reds on your clock face. \\- **Resting** heart rate seemed comparable to what Fitbit told me until I switched the Heart Rate setting from ""Always"" to ""Frequent."" With it set to Frequent, the resting heart rate number doesn\'t seem even close anymore. \\- I regularly see different little icons show up at the top of the clock face, but I have no idea what they are supposed to indicate. \\- When I get more than one notification at a time, I\'m not sure how to see more than the first one. Scrolling/back doesn\'t seem to do it. &amp;#x200B; I\'m sad that the battery life seems worse than advertised, and I am not a fan of the band on this device (I hope replacement bands become available on Amazon soon), but I do plan to wear the Galaxy Fit until a better option comes along.

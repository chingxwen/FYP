0,So the Samsung galaxy card linked an article about iPhone? I'd bet the Samsung galaxy card posts a lot of tech related articles. No big deal?,2018-06-30
1,"If they have the same prices, you may think of the J7Pro, it has a better amoled display, a good camera, nice build, excellent battery and a better samsung exp. However the moto G5s Plus is more balanced. The choice resides on whether you expect good multimedia or a balanced phone to do many things.",2018-06-30
2,Looking at it it doesn't appear to have any speakers built in. Best bet would be to try plugging in some external speakers to the headphone jack. [,2018-06-30
3,Check if the TV has any updates. The delete and reinstall the HULU app in smart hub. See if that clears it. If you send the report to hulu or samsung. Because it is really pointing to one of the two has an issue.,2018-06-30
4,Yeah that's what's weird I reset the Smart Hub and told Samsung they reset it remotely didn't fix it so they sort of gave the shoulder shrug,2018-06-30
5,It might be Hulu. But I think it is something with the Hulu app and passing audio on toslink. But I would keep pressing Samsung. Ask for tier 2 support and so on. Does your bar have a HDMI port. Most Samsung's do. If so I would they using HDMI ARC port on the tv.,2018-06-30
6,It the problem does not follow to the HDMI. It is a Samsung issue. Toslink not activating in time.,2018-06-30

8,Updated my Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 to Oreo and since then it seems I am unable to delete LinkedIn. Very weird.,2018-07-01
9,"Just get the duos. They're both legit S9s. with the 'DBT' (Germany) product code. The single SIM variants are usually from carriers as Samsung has started selling dual SIM models by default, everywhere, even Europe. Only the ones sold through carriers are single SIM.",2018-07-01
10,I have the same problem using iconx2018 with Samsung Galaxy s9+ that's pretty annoying for 160 Euro headset,2018-07-01
11,"Ahh shit. Well I'd try take that back asap. You should talk to manager at store and explain situation. If what you're saying is true, then they should take back hopefully? Because if something happens to your phone again, warranty won't cover it. Root= Voided. Even if you unroot doesn't matter. Knox is tripped and there's no going back. Also Samsung pay and secure folder won't work. Will have issues with other apps as you already mentioned. I do know you can download netflix apk on offical website and works. Just to be sure go on play store and download root checker app.",2018-07-01
12,Doesn't Samsung still make their parts?,2018-07-01
13,"If the phone is plugged in, and I restart it, it won't get past the Samsung logo, it will just keep restarting. But once I unplug it, it finishes the restart. I found it when I restarted the phone after messing with swift installer. I like to keep it plugged in when using Swift installer since it tends to use a lot of battery installing all the skins.",2018-07-01
14,"Sounds like spotty cell data, not Samsung issue. I had issues on Verizon. Cut them and my data is phenomenal.",2018-07-01
15,"Honestly don't buy from carriers. Ever. They always seem to lock you in to SOMETHING all the time. Try the official Samsung Page, or other offers at Best Buy or etc. Way better deals, maybe even bundles.",2018-07-01
16,"Well Samsung releases million different versions and different models across various price points (not a praise 😂). There have their A, J series and probably many other that you lose count. So to answer they already have phones at all price points.",2018-07-01
17,Samsung replied back to the BBB stating what they told me my first call in. That in internal connector was damaged. They are sorry but they will not return the phone to me because I agreed to it in the terms of service when I sent it in. They will not give me the $375 they owe me. Is there any legal action I can take at this point? Can I make them show me proof that my phone had internal connector damage? It's most likely untrackable by now being this long in the process.,2018-07-01
18,"I get what you’re saying. I don’t have that promo going (Att) but all the other stores around ours (Verizon, t mobile, etc.) all have the marked up price of 914.99+tax and are running a 200 off promo (price in the Samsung store) In general buying from Samsung or Best Buy or one of those places can usually be cheaper, and equipment changes are very easy for us as long as your phone is AT&amp;T ready. We charge like 5$ for SIM cards (can coupon on new activations) so that might be the route you want to go. AT&amp;T is charging a 30$ upgrade fee even if you just change SIM cards now though afaik, so beware of that. (Our S9+ is 914.99 too)",2018-07-01
19,"I worked in a cell phone booth for a little bit during Christmas and I can tell you that Samsung really does cover most of the bases when it comes to price, they have their introductory J series followed by the mid-range A series, and then there S Series and the notes. More than likely if Apple does release a newer phone at a lower price rate it would be replacing the iPhone SE which was essentially an iPhone 6 in an iPhone 5 case. The newest phone in the mid-range series for Samsung is the A8 which essentially was just a refresh of an A5 but with better pieces inside. So I doubt Samsung would come out with another phone for a while seeing that they just did one.",2018-07-01
20,"Far from the best in every catagory, except for processor but thats just for those tasks but all the other hardware holds it back way to far and the better specs of android make it a much cleaner experience especially if you get a launcher like nova, as for display he must be joking my brother is so pissed at himself for buying the x and his biggest gripe is that while the display is nice it just doesnt compare to the samsung displays god and its not just that Iphones are decent in all catagories but android is just far superior, you make the phone look like you want and change how it functions entirly (plus you could easily get any app or song for free without breaking warrenty) I cant get myself to get any apple products because each one just becomes more and more of a cashgrab with each product, and theu would only really be worth the price and a 40-50% discount Also apple and innovation dont really gp together, especially not the design up untill rhe 6 and x it was the same peice of crap phone design (not to mention blatently leaving in a bend gate to cut production costs), but the most innovative design was the xaomi mi mix until the, galaxy until the Find X (which might i add was an absolutly perfect way to hid the front facing components",2018-07-02
21,"I kind of don't get it, probably out of the loop pretty bad, but what were the issues between the two? I just always assumed it was the OS and maybe a display or two on models since Android models rock different display properties. (Last iPhone I had was a 5 and switched back to Android after due to iTunes never working right, everything wanting to sync bothered me as I try to keep my phone a brick as much as possible and hate developers butting in, and lack of home screen customization. There was also a case where I lost all my music, photos, and contacts when my phone did an auto update and over the phone I was snobbly told to back up and that apple products work better together WHEN why is something that is supposed to INSTALL something doing the exact opposite of that by DELETING files... in apps that are apple certified so it's not like a third party mishap. Haven't gone back to apple since that one and have had an s5 and 3 s7's after so idk the full details but some of the features now are either niche, lack proper support, or is pushed in models for consumer feedback. Like I highly doubt Samsung would take audio ports out of their phones like Apple tried to do on the 9 or 10 hehe.)",2018-07-02
22,Are those Samsung?,2018-07-02
23,"I believe it is sent to a third party company, not actually Samsung itself I was told when i wanted extra pictures. I would disagree with the Samsung and ask to see photos or the damage that was reported. I know there is a disagree with Samsung option and then there is accept their findings option as well. After a bunch of back and forth and the issue isnt resolved the BBB will decide if it will move to arbitration or not.",2018-07-02

26,You could go to a Samsung authorized shop sushi UbreakitWefixit Tell them to check or change battery,2018-07-02
27,"Apple has the branding. Any lower-cost iPhone is still an iPhone. Samsung's Galaxy S devices are obviously their higher-end devices, but their mid-range and intro phones are no longer Galaxy S--they're branded with something your average consumer isn't as familiar with. If Samsung were really to follow suit, they'd probably have the Galaxy S 10+, Galaxy S 10, and Galaxy S 10 SE (or whatever), at different price points.",2018-07-02
28,Why did you buy a phone from Samsung then?,2018-07-02
29,"[ * Download the USB driver for the S7 (or whatever device you happen to have) from Samsung's website * download ADB for your particular computers' OS (linked in the above article) * Enable developer mode on your phone * Use the above guide and the ADB commands to uninstall the application I did it and removed most of the Samsung default applications (email, galaxy apps, etc) with no problem. Doesn't require root either, as it's not fully uninstalling the app, just uninstalling it for the current user. I believe this is what you and u/wearer_of_boxers were looking for at least.",2018-07-02
30,Samsung and Android back with those sweet hidden features,2018-07-02
31,I'm honestly not sure I just use the samsung app in pro mode but I'd guess so,2018-07-02
32,"People who are coming in to buy an Android device know the difference between the series, it isn't as monotonous as an iPhone people do a little bit of research. The iPhone SE is barely usable at this point, the interface is so laggy and unresponsive it would blow your mind. and if they were to do it the way you suggested it would throw her off their entire scheme, they're not going to add in a Samsung Galaxy S10 SE that's just not how they do things. Besides the point they literally just released the S9 a few months ago people would be pissed if the s10 was coming out.",2018-07-02
33,It's still not possible to connect to your Gear watch with the Samsung gear app. I had hoped that this would be fixed after a couple of beta versions of Android P (currently running dp 4 on my Pixel 2 XL) but it seems those Samsung developers aren't in a hurry. Latest update was in December -17.. Thankfully I have a s9+ but with the pretty average battery life that phone has I would have preferred to run it on my Pixel. Guess Samsung will have caught up with the Android development this coming winter in best case.,2018-07-02
34,"Hey! Thanks for the advice. I've always stuck with Samsung, are Vizio and TLC reliable?",2018-07-02
35,"It's happening to my dad's phone too, he's using a brand new Samsung Galaxy Halo on Cricket",2018-07-02
36,TLC has a quality control issue. Not very reliable. Vizio is ok. I like Sony and samsung and Panasonic personally. You really get what you pay for IMHO.,2018-07-02

39,Its been there since Android 7.1. Samsung just implemented it with their Oreo (8.0) update,2018-07-02
40,The first original feature on a Samsung phone and you guys call it a bug. Ridiculous.,2018-07-03
41,I had the same issue and corrected it by getting a new usb C cable (not samsung..) Ensure your cable end has a blue chip where it plugs into power brick for fast charging. Good luck.,2018-07-03
42,"I meant what I said in the whole package department. Good screen, best processor, fastest storage, headphone jack, new and better aluminum than the 6. The reason I actually got one is because Samsung removed the expandable storage and removable battery from the S6, I didn't regret it one bit.",2018-07-03
43,Just make sure you don't use Samsung messages 😀😀😀😀😀😀,2018-07-03
44,I think OP is saying that he is ditching apple for samsung. I guess it could go either way though.,2018-07-03
45,"Thanks for the reply - I've only ever used the official charger with the phone (mainly because I don't have any other USB-C cables for anything else) so there shouldn't be any issues there. I've contacted the Samsung Store in Edinburgh (unfortunately, my nearest one is about a 150 mile round trip) and they've said they would take a look at it, and likely fix it under warranty since it's not even a year old :)",2018-07-03
46,"Possibly. 50/50 either software or hardware. I know it sucks, but you should try a factory reset. If that doesn't solve issue. Then it's more than likely a hardware issue. Time to file for warranty with Samsung. Ask for local ifixubreak and you will have your phone in a few hours back.",2018-07-03
47,"Welcome to the best decision you've made in a while ;) Seriously though. I had the first iPhone all the way through (each phone in between) to the iPhone 5. Had 3 iPads. And 4 iPods from the original metal spinning hard drive to the later model touch sreens etc. And I dabbled in iOS developing 3 apps that used to be on the app store (made a few hundred on em). Then I switched to Galaxy/Android one day after having a few hours to toy around on a friend's I've now gone from every Galaxy from that point to the Note 3, 4, 5, 7, 7 (lol), and now the 8. Since then I have switched my parents from iPhones and iPads to Galaxys and Samsung tablets. My wife too although she was just on an old LG something which was android so she doesn't count haha. Why am I spouting off about ALL of that? 1) Shows I am not just an android fan boy, I had plenty of exposure to apple garbage. Honestly I STILL believe apple was better up until around the iPhone 5 when Samsung started flying past them. 2) Shows even the excuse ""But I don't need all that extra shit, I am a simple person and prefer the training wheels style of apple"" is still not true as my parents are old and retired and absolutely love their new Android overlords and are now on their 4th or 5th phones. 3) Despite the Note 7 fuck up, I'm still here and loyal and honestly could not be happier with my current phone, and my past ones (even that Note 7 was bad ass). Love my wife's new phone. And we have my son on an LG G6 which is nice too. P.S. Your favorite thing about Android will be watching Apple commercials when they announce 'new' features and you giggle as we've had that for YEARS now. P.P.S. If you're looking for those ""must have"" apps I won't go off on an extensive list but Nova Launcher is a must and is worth the money for Pro. EDIT: Clarification on a statement",2018-07-03
48,"Tier 1 advisor here, using a Samsung too :P",2018-07-03
49,"You could do transfer app. But samsung has a pretty good back up built into settings. It clouds backup all your contacts, apps, sms, calls, etc. Works pretty well. I find that easier to do. Yeah if it's changing when turned off. Then more and likely software issue. So yes factory reset should do the trick.",2018-07-03
50,"This shit is wrong. Hope someone gets sued for this either Samsung or Tmobile. Imagine your phone sending XXX pics to your family/friends/co-workers? Wtf? If that happened to me, would definitely wanna sue. Glad I don't use shit stock sms. Idk why people do? There's way better 3rd party sms out there.",2018-07-03
51,Do you know if Samsung has teased anything for next year yet? Not sure if I should wait or not because I am torn between the QXFN or the LG OLED series.,2018-07-03
52,"Had a screen burn in and went to Samsung's Contracted Repair shop (UBreakIFix). Before taking my phone they requested I remove the password so that they can run diagnostic software after the repair to make it sure the device is 100%. Fine, I understand that they have to do the pressure test to make sure the water resistance is still working and what not. But then they made me sign the paper that they're not responsible for any data breach. Really? The selling point for me and Samsung is Knox/security. Your contracted repairmen are making customers sign off their data if there's a defect covered under warranty. This is a BIG hole in the security. Just venting. Tell me what you all think. I'm considering going on Twitter. Samsung called me to follow up on the repair with a survey and the lady claimed she had no idea that was the issue. Really, again? You make a million dollar contract deal with another company and you don't know their privacy policy??",2018-07-03
53,They can be transferred. World has WhatsApp and telegram. And LMFAO what optimization? iOS 11 is the most buggy release ever. Shame on people who call it optimization. Samsung is always better then Apple's jail,2018-07-03
54,There is not one close to my home. I found YouTube videos instructing how to remove the battery but I have heard you can't just throw them out they have to be disposed at a special location. How do I find where to dispose of the battery. This is my first tablet computer and I have not have this problem before with any computer or cell phone. Do all tablet have these type of dangerous batteries? I had heard of the new Samsung phones exploding so I did not buy their phones. I thought this issue only affected the phones and maybe newer tablets.,2018-07-03
55,"Want to switch to Samsung s9 plus but everyone I test it out at the stop, I seem to start using it like I use my iPhone X...not having a home button makes navigating so easy and smooth. I don’t want to lose that aspect of the iPhone yet not to mention screen recording as well...so still researching and testing out the s9+ at stores.",2018-07-03
56,"Yeah I just got the S9 and haven't set up bixby, haven't even created a Samsung account. You can disable it entirely.",2018-07-03
57,When I sent in my Samsung S8+ for a screen repair they wiped the phone. This is normal procedure and what is expected when you turn in your phone. They wiped it immediately so that the risk of a data leak in any stage of the repair is non-existent. That you had to remove the passcode is not normal and I would not give my phone away unlocked. At least wipe the phone yourself beforehand. Hope you get it back repaired at least!,2018-07-03
58,"Well, i have Samsung Account Do you have the latest update ? (Oreo ?) And is there a bixby button in camera application ?",2018-07-03
59,I got it back the same day (5-6 hour turnaround.) It's my business line and doesn't have THAT much personal info. But they repaired it without wiping the phone (screen replacement.) I ended up trusting them but my concern is to know is this standard practice by Samsung (as in the authorized contractors Samsung uses?) If Samsung is allowing this to happen then they're just as much on the hook.,2018-07-03
60,"Wow, Samsung finally started thinking... I mean, they push Bixby so hard that rather than doing something good for it, they are making people hate it. It should be ""OPT-IN"" instead of ""try to disable"". Same as Flipboard on my N3, i had to swap the launcher to get rid of it...",2018-07-03
61,"Yeah I was happy that I managed to avoid all the Samsung/Bixby crap when I set up the phone, I was worried about that when I bought it. The one thing that's annoying is that you have to sign up for Bixby in order to disable it, though I've just remapped mine to flashlight using bxActions so it doesn't bother me.",2018-07-03
62,I managed to remove the battery. Not sure if I could afford a new tablet atm. How much are replacement batteries and where do buy then to ensure you get a real Samsung brand replacement battery? I could not find the same model of battery at Samsung's website.,2018-07-03
63,No it's not the new Samsung phones who have the issues it's the the one that came 2 years ago And it wasn't a wide spread issue it's just your device You could probably just discharge the battery and dispose at your local junk yard,2018-07-03
64,"As someone who has both an iPhoneX and a Samsung Galaxy S9+, I can say without a doubt Apple has better optimization. ""Most buggy release ever"" is relative and I feel that the software is still better than Samsung/Android. Personal preference, sure, but that's just my two cents. Can't beat the hardware on Samsung though",2018-07-03
65,"Yeah. Sounds like the case. I always make a backup 1st thing to my memory card, and then save via Samsung.",2018-07-03
67,You will never find a Samsung battery your best bet is a Chinese battery I wish you luck. I would just buy another tablet. Or go without it until I can buy one,2018-07-03
68,"Sounds very similar yeah, next time you see emergency calls only have a look at the network operator and let me know how you get on. I've let samsung know about it so hopefully will see a fix at some point soon.",2018-07-03
69,"I work in retail selling TVs, computers, cameras, etc. There's MUCH more to what makes a TV other than the screen size and resolution. The most basic, other than resolution, would be the panel type. More expensive panels have better colour reproduction, better viewing angles, and tend to be held to a higher quality control standard so tend to last longer. At the highest end of these panels currently available to consumers would be Samsung's QLED, and LG/Sony's OLED. OLED has the advantage of getting perfect blacks as each LED generates it's own light, eliminating the need of a backlight, and allowing OLEDs to be the most colour accurate panels. However, QLED is brighter, so it works better in a brighter room, and it doesn't have the risk of burn-in like OLEDs have. Then there's what type of backlighting the TV uses. For simplicity I'll keep it to edge lighting, and full array lighting. Edge lighting is cheaper, but you get the drawbacks of worse image and colour quality, and you can notice dropoffs in brightness on certain parts of the screen. Full array lighting has LEDs spread all behind the panel for a more uniform and consistent backlight. High Dynamic Range (HDR) is a feature that has become more common on TVs in the past few years. [Linus over here can explain it better than I can]( Next is 4K upscaling. Almost no cable signal does 4K, unless you have a fiber optic TV box. So to get your standard cable signal filling up the full 4K screen, the TV has to upscale the signal, which basically means it has to generate extra pixels that weren't originally there. Generally, the more expensive the TV, the better the upscaling is. Right now Sony seems to have the best upscaling chips. Of course, you can get 4k content from online sources, or from a 4K Blu-Ray player with 4K disc though. Other than that, as you pay more, Smart TV functionalities tend to be better and more snappy, speakers get better, etc. The main reason I would rather buy a TV from the big guys (Samsung, Sony, LG), rather than the small guys (Hisense, RCA, etc.) is overall quality and support. You will experience MUCH better support from the bigger companies, not only in customer service, but also in setting up third party devices such as universal remotes, etc. The big guys tend to have more authorized service centers also, where as you're pretty much out of luck with the small guys.",2018-07-03
70,"To be honest if Samsung keeps Bixby around for future phones without the ability to disable it WITHOUT signing up for Samsung services or downloading a shady 3rd party app, I'll be going to a different manufacturer. I absolutely hate accidentally pressing that button and Bixby interrupting whatever I'm doing.",2018-07-03
71,So how do you turn it off without third party apps or creating a Samsung account? I don't see it in settings and all of the tutorials I've found require both of these.,2018-07-03

I'm not saying they ARE copying your data I'm saying to what extent does ""breach"" mean? I should post a follow up. I ended up realizing that the fingerprint sensor wasn't straight and flushed balanced. There was a noticeable depth. I ended up going to the actual Samsung store and they even noticed it too. So they fixed my phone at the store today and glad to say it feels better. I don't think I'd use the 3rd party contractor again.",2018-07-03
74,Yes and no. Samsung with tripped knox will not honor warranty. Is it illegal? Yes. Do they care? No. They know that most people won't bother to go to court do to cost and time.

103,"Thank you for posting this. I traded in my phone in in early February. 4.5 months later, in late June, my credit card was charged. I was told by Samsung that the phone had liquid damage. 1. It did not. It was in excellent condition. 2. I carefully went through the Terms and Conditions before sending my phone in, making sure it met each one. Nowhere is liquid or water damage listed in the T&amp;C. 3. Samsung had the phone for over 4 months before discovering any damage. It sounds like the damage occurred while in Samsung's care, as yours did. I initialized a dispute with my credit card company very soon after the charge was made. I have contacted Samsung 7 times via phone and email, and they have been incredibly unhelpful. The first representative said he couldn't find any evidence of liquid damage, which he thought was odd, nor could he find anything in the T&amp;C about liquid damage. They are still charging me, though. This post encouraged me to contact the BBB, which I have just done. We've been Samsung customers for a long time, but I am now seriously rethinking the purchase of any future products. Thank you OP.",2018-07-04

121,"Only had my S9+ for a week. After 2 days Bixby had to go. 90% because button. A damn dedicated physical button in an inconvenient place for a single app/tool that a meaningful portion of owners will never use. Every button is an extra inlet for potential water damage on a phone that's supposed to be pretty strongly water resistant. Also, I am completely uninformed about Bixby in particular, but I have a reluctance and paranoia about 'digital assistants' and their potential for breaching my privacy in a number of ways. So Bixby was a no-go for me right off the bat. ALSO, I am a boring middle age man stuck in his ways. I've used smartphones since before Android - the old Samsung Windows Mobile phones 10+ years ago. They were horrible, of course. But I've had a way of doing things since Android 3 or so that I just haven't really changed. My stuff is setup as much like my old configs as possible. I don't want shiny new stuff. I want my old stuff, only faster and better. Bixby has no place in that. All my yapping aside, the S9 and S9+ are absolutely fantastic phones and I'm extremely lucky the Verizon dude recognized me as a football teammate from 25 years ago so I got almost $500 off.

Was a tad bit slipper when I was having my hands slightly wet from transpiration, decided to get a case before the beautiful glass was going to break one day. Was this close to getting the basic Samsung silicone black cover, didn't like the way it looked and the way it felt in the pocket, I then gave both the led cover (big fan in the past) case a view and then the clear view cover, said I wanted something different. I instantly wanted to get the alcantara one until I remembered it ruins itself once it touches water. I then instantly bought the protective standing cover. Do not regret it one bit even tho it looks a bit weird on the back. The phone altho heavier, is easier to hold in your hand, the button pressing feels really easy compared to the naked phone, the stand is a huge huge plus and the way the back is made, if I have money or papers in my pocket, I don't risk pulling it all out once I grab my phone. The only actual minus is the extra weight, the phone now easily passed the 200g mark and the physical size increased. One think I'm a huge fan of however, is the fact that I know how sensitive OLED panels can be to direct sunlight, this case has big protruding lips over the top and bottom of the phone. I can easily put the phone on my table laying screen side down without an issue and if somebody calls or messages me, the edge lighting lights the table, I can easily tell basic whatsapp messages or facebook messages apart from actual sms texts. **TL;DR**: I used my S9+ without a case for exactly one month, afterwards I got the protective standing cover case, never going back, it's a bit bulky but I don't care.

After the one minute, press continue or start, it will start writing the new firmware to the phone. After the process ends, the phone will be good as new.

EQ and custom sound profile are great to have * Customizable * Software gets better, homescreen looks modern and also on par with some launchers * Capable device with RAM management and storage that never runs out (especially with SD Card) * Battery is okay, lasts the whole day with battery saver on and stuff like Background Network off and AOD off. If you can get it discounted, it is absolutely worth it! Hope you make a great decision and love your phone OP. Love the S9 Plus!",2018-07-08
195,"This phone is marvelous ~ Simply put, the display is incredible. Watching videos or scrolling through Instagram is very enjoyable and it gets hard to go back to other displays (we get spoiled :p) The camera is excellent too and if you're not a huge camera savvy, it will suit all your needs just fine and keep you going for a long time. The audio experience is really great too, plugged in or not. I underestimated having dual speakers as a feature but I end up using Dolby Atmos the most. Seriously, it's just fun to be able to play music in the house with your own phone speaker. Also, the AKG bundled earphones are pretty great too. Headphone jack is a plus. S9 is surprisingly fast. I've had previous samsung phones and they always felt kind of slow, but this one doesnt lag and even after 4 months it performs the same as it did when I first got it. Battery isnt its best feature but it comfortably gets me through 1 day and can last to 2 with some conservative usage. The software isnt as annoying and Android 8.0 adds a bonus too. Just be advised that software updates for Samsung phones always take 5 billion years so just keep that in mind. Seriously, a great phone! Good luck OP and please update us if you get it or not!",2018-07-08

202,"Ok, I will try to provide some feedback for you. I actually have two pairs of level u headphones. I have the pros and a pair with anc. I have two pairs because I don't always charge them everyday and when one dies I just swap them out for the other pair and charge the dead ones in my car. I'm lucky enough to be in a semi construction job where I can wear these all day. I listen to music often but audio books are what I listen to the most. So on to the good news. Work time..yes you will get 8 hrs out of these easily. I can make it a full day with music or books but most time I am starting and stopping often or taking calls..my working partner bought some after trying mine and loves them also. Now for the anc. I would say that it is decent. I think the main advantage is that they are ear buds and have a passive ability to block sound as it is so the anc doesn't have to be spectacular. I have been in loud server rooms for a whole day and don't know how I would have lived without the anc. It really helps but if you're looking for Bose quiet comfort level of anc it's not going to happen..those things are crazy good. As far as battery life. It's going to take a hit with anc on..if I had to guess because I haven't run anc all day for a while, I would say about 6 hours maybe a bit more. The good news is that these things charge very fast..you can plug them in for 15-20 min and get 1.5 hrs. Sound wise..I think they are good.. decently loud although I don't think any wireless headphones are loud enough. You do have access to Samsungs uhq sound if your using a newer Galaxy and yes it makes quite the difference. The sound is much more crisp. Bass wise they are good..not crazy bass but I think they are just fine.. Comfort and build..I think they are very comfortable. I know not a lot of people like around the neck stuff but these are just fine..light weight and the build quality is the best out of the two. With pricing the way it has dropped lately I don't think you can go wrong with these..I was looking into the new around the neck headphones from Samsung but I don't think they support uhq or any other high def sound so that's a no go for me.. I purchased my standard pros at Sam's club for a good price and ordered the anc from Samsung. At the time they were fairly new so they were still pricy.. I hope this has helped you. I have had these for a while and the last thing I will say is that they are fairly durable. I am a pretty careful person with electronics but even still they are pretty strong. Good luck .",2018-07-09

230,"I had helped my friend switch from an iPhone 7 with Smart Switch and worked very well. It can't move everything (like certain messaging apps) but this works easily. It'll even match up existing apps and ask if you want to install corresponding Android versions. The only annoying part is that during the ""search"" process, the slightest movement of the cable will cancel it. For things that don't come over, check to see if the app has a backup cloud feature. Most of the big apps are there and corresponding desktop services/apps are also there. Personally, I would look to moving things out of iCloud to allow other apps access to your stored data for the most flexibility. The biggest change could be Google Photos if you're not using it already. Moving files from iCloud to anything else is fairly trivial. Samsung also has a backup service as well which you can choose to use or not. I think their backup services are decent. Pickup a MicroSD card for external photo storage. It'll free up app space on your phone. Samsung also likes to duplicate apps so you can choose to try others before deciding (like text messaging, contacts, gallery, etc) and then disable/hide the ones you don't want to use.

238,"True. When I updated my iPhone, suddenly I had only 25% of my original battery life. I learned later, that they changed the way the radios were handled in low-power mode, and since I live in a zero-to-1 bar area, my battery life dropped to 2-3 hours (was getting 8-9 hours before, advertised for much, much more) a day before shutdown. I've noticed this effect with different phones, manufacturers, and oses. Like others have said, if it's still under warranty, take it in and let the shop have a look at it. Was it always crap, or did it die gradually (or even suddenly)? So many things can cause drain. If you have great battery life in safe mode, then it's an app causing the issue.

Without video proof, even the 30 to 90 claim is beyond anything possible, especially with qualcomm quick charging 2.0 or samsung fast charging 1.0. I'm sorry. I've had quite a lot of phones, none from Samsung (even S6 which had a tiny battery) would charge THAT fast. The fastest charging phone I ever owned was this A5 2017. It takes a literal 1 hour and about 5-10 minutes to go from dead to 100&amp;#37;.",2018-07-11

245,"TL;DR: Huge explanation bellow about charging these phones. If you aren't in the mood to read, just watch the video linked bellow. It's showing pretty much everything I was saying up. Have a great day! That's the case with most Samsung phones for a while now. My S9+ also charges quite a significant bit if plugged in the wall for like 15-30 minutes. Only requirement is that I turn off wifi/data when doing so and I get about 40&amp;#37; in 30 minutes. After that it charges slower and when I reach 90&amp;#37; it takes a full 20-30 minutes to hit 100. Which is normal behaviour. It acts this way to preserve the life of the battery. Now. Pure proof of what I said earlier is, first of all, the fact that battery technology works this way. If you will start using the other 15&amp;#37; percent of the battery til' you hit 0&amp;#37;, you'll realise that the 15&amp;#37; left is lasting longer than as much as 30&amp;#37; of your normal usage. My old S6 once lasted me around 13 minutes on 1&amp;#37;. I wanted to fully drain it and recharge it. And the last 1&amp;#37; lasted more than about 10&amp;#37; did. There are talks about these phenomenons on the internet. Won't bother trying to find them. My analogy for you (and I'm ending on this note) is the fact that all current Samsung phones that support fast charging, have the same exact componentry for charging. My S9 does not charger any faster or slower than your A8 or my A5 or even J series phones that support fast charging. The power brick delivers 10W in fast charging mode. Maybe my S9 will be 1-2&amp;#37; more efficient in handling that, but not enough for it to be noticeable in the long run. You'll maybe save 30 minutes of charging per year due to that efficiency increase. [Here's a youtube video from a Hindi youtuber showing that in fact, it takes both the A8 and A8+ a normal amount of time to go from 0&amp;#37; to 100&amp;#37;.]( And judging by the increases seen here, it's physically impossible for your A8 to reach 90&amp;#37; from 30&amp;#37; in just 20-30 minutes, let alone 15-20. Unless you had your phone repaired and you got a smaller battery placed in your phone (Something like 1500mA), you're either not aware of how long it actually takes to charge (because you're usually doing something else than spending time to check your phone religiously) or you're simply oblivious and pretty much assuming everything rather than basing off actual numbers. And with that I'm ending my thesis here. I have owned many samsung phones both before fast charging was a thing and after and I have noticed always how long it took to charge a phone. A note 4 for example, does indeed charge slower compared to something like an S7 while an S7 charges barely any slower compared to an S9. Why? The charging technology inside the phone has improved through time quite a bit. We moved most of the charging components into chargers (hence they get so hot when charging a phone), and now the phone simply has to do minimal work. The same charger that shipped with the Galaxy Note 4 (first official fast charging Samsung device) has identical hardware on the inside with any samsung adaptive fast charger sold today. Identical. It can charge both Quick Charge 2.0 devices &amp; Fast Charge 1.0 devices just well. And simply basing off the fact that the charger itself is identical, I can simply say our phones charge the same, exact same actually efficiency being slightly different from one phone to another but newer gen devices such as the A8 and S9 having virtually the same capability.",2018-07-11

326,"I already owned the Westones, so that part of the purchase was not needed. To get customs, you pay an audiologist to make a silicone mold, which isn't expensive. It feels funny, admittedly :) . Those molds of your inner and outer ears are sent to the vendor who will craft them into custom fitted IEMS for you. In many cases, those can be used as plug-in replacements for the generic inner ear molds with an existing IEM - such as the AKG model included with the Samsung. You might have to specify the IEM model, potentially. In my case, I used InEarz because they agreed to reuse my Westone hardware (i.e., they literally broke the shells open to get at their components), then create custom IEMs as single units for each ear, made to my specs (i.e., shorter inner ear depth, softer canal material, custom outer shell colours, 2-prong cable attachment type, Westone audio hardware). I don't know if InEarz is still adapting existing IEMs to custom IEMs or if they only sell their own audio hardware (which includes the custom fit), but here's their process and links to prices, if curious: Their Representative at the time was pretty good at answering my questions before I started the order process.

I have a Note 8 and one I really like is Flux White which gives your phone an Android P style look including the rounded notifications and updated status bar. Since the S9 is on Oreo you would need the Substratum add-on ""Andromeda"" to make Substratum work with Oreo. It's worth a look.

I wouldn't get another S7, if I were you. I don't even know if you can brand new ones from stores anymore. If you're looking for something more budget friendly and if you want a flat screen instead of the curved screen, the new A8 looks pretty slick. I work in a cell phone store and the A8 is outselling the S series right now. For every S8 or S9 we sell, we sell at least two A8's. Most people picking the A8 are coming from Samaung S5, S6, and LG G4 and G5. Most S7 users are picking the S9, though.

On top of the OS difference, Samsung has even more features than standard Android. There can be a steep learning curve for new users.

They are not very short reading, but once you did, you are good to fly. [ [ Apps wise, most of the popular apps on iOS are also available on Android, so start with them.

If you're in the US it might take a while, because carriers need time, because they're lazy and greedy. Second, no, 8.1 is not possible. Even Samsungs flagships are on 8.0.0. Why? Because 8.1 was mostly bug fixes and features compared to 8.0, and Samsung phones already have those features, and if there are bugs, a small system update is used to eliminate them. Long story short, upgrading to 8.1 is just unnecessary and would cost a lot of time and money with no gain. And third, people always cry after an update, even about totally unrelated issues. Usually a system update is a good thing, bringing further optimisation, performance and features.",2018-08-02

Alright, but the question is: when they merge it with the S line, will there still be a variant with the S-pen? This is key for many people who like the pen. If I know that the Note 9 is the last Samsung phone (for the foreseeable future) that will have an S-pen, then I WILL buy one this Fall to ensure I have the best pen experience for years to come.

Exact same size and look as the 5s but better performance?)",2018-08-04
484,"What I like about iPhone X: - I love the no home button and the gestures. It's so intuitive and makes using a home button to navigate feel old fashioned and slow. - The camera is better on the X compared to the S9. Especially selfies. - I like the way the screen looks on the X when watching videos. What I like about the s9: - The Dolby sound is super nice and the sound makes up for the slightly more saturated look when watching Netflix or YouTube - The quick charge is super convenient - I have better data connectivity when I have my SIM in the S9. It's faster and I have less ""no service"" issues - I LOVE the Samsung themes and customization. It's super fun",2018-08-04
485,I wonder if they use the note 9 Samsung used the whole album,2018-08-04
486,"Yeah sure. I actually like a lot of the features Samsung puts I to their phone. But one thing that surprised me was my s7 edge slowed down really really badly very recently. If it wasn't for that I probably would've kept it and got a new battery for it but My brother in law had an OG pixel and that was so smooth still when compared to s7e. I jumped on a prime day deal for the essential phone and have been loving it. Had Samsung released the note 9 last month I would've bought that because i really felt I needed a new phone and I was dead set on that. But since trying stock Android, I've really liked having the blank canvas that is my phone. So now.... I'm not too sure what I would do when it comes to getting my next new phone and decided to give myself a year with this phone to see if I want the pixel 4 or note 10, or even see if this phone holds up well enough to keep. Trdr: Pros and cons for both but I think stock Android aligns better for me.",2018-08-04

488,Thanks very much for the reply. I am trying to decide between the Galaxy A5 and A6. The A6 already had 8.0 out of the box. The only thing that makes me consider the A6 is that fact. It seems more 'optimized' for 8.0 out of the box and seems that further updates are more easily possible on that phone. I get the feeling that Samsung won't update the A5 further than the 8.0. What are your thoughts and ideas about this? Is this a legitimate concern? Does it make it a smarter and more future proof decision to purchase an A6 for this reason?,2018-08-04

495,"Yeah, I still don't see why phone manufacturers seem to be okay with the current battery life. If you made a survey asking people with a smartphone (doesn't matter which OS or brand), I'm positive almost 100% people would say they want a better battery life. A lot of progress has been made in the last couple of years sure, but the fact that a ""heavy"" user still needs to charge throughout the day seems kinda unrealistic. Especially considering heavy use on a phone won't ever come near the heavy use a computer can do (rendering 4k footage for example). Just seems stupid to me when companies like Huawei can fit a 4000 mAh battery in their P20 Pro but Samsung can't in their Plus-sized phone with a higher pixel count and more ""features"" that require battery (such as AOD). Some argue that quick charing makes up for it, and to an extent I can agree. But there are situations where you are unable to charge and it may screw you over big time. Just a few weeks ago I flying home from Berlin to Stockholm, and the flight was delayed by 2 hours or so. There was no charger near me (trust me, I checked about every corner and place near my gate), and my phone was running low on juice due to it being used quite a lot throughout the day. So now I had like 35% battery, over 4 hours until I get home. Sure the phone survived, but was I able to do much, if anything on it? Not really. Those are the situations where you really need that extra juice. Or if you're on the buss on the way home, or on a train with no charging ports. It is getting more usual to have chargers on busses and trains nowadays, and longer flights too. But still, until we are there, the consumers are the ones to suffer for the companies and their greed.",2018-08-04

The z3 launched just recently and it is said to have a 3000 mah battery. Why don't they make the battery like 3500 or something? Because they want their customers to buy that battery moto mod to increase battery. They want you to spend more money on that. Same thing with Apple and Samsung. Why not just put a big battery in all of their phones? Because they want you to spend that extra money on a plus sized phone with a bigger battery if that's what you desire.,2018-08-04
498,"Yeah, and with Apple &amp; Samsung it is getting embarrasing. Their phones are exceeding the price cost of an above average gaming laptop, and an excellent ""work"" laptop, yet their phones can't last you the entire day. I feel like they could throw in bigger batteries without losing a lot of profit. And in the words of MKBHD (and a lot of others) - nobody cares how thin the phone if it is at the cost of battery life.

655,Samsung Pay is $450 dollars off when you order straight through Samsung.com. did the calculations for the 128GB. Thats 550 before taxes and payments of 23 bucks for 24 months on your carrier.,2018-08-09

658,"Looks amazing. Pricey, but has a lot of value. For someone looking to upgrade from an iPhone 7, this makes makes $1250 seem (more) reasonable, compared to what you get with 256GB iPhone X. Using the S-Pen as a shutter is something I can see myself using a TON. Why get a selfie stick, when you can just prop the phone up and BOOM. Storage options are great, although I wish 8GB was the standard across the board. Now what I'm not pleased about is the lack of color choices in the US - no black or bronze. Seriously Samsung? Also not thrilled about how little value these phones hold. I can get a Note 8 for sub $500 right now, which is insane. All in all though, this phone does look exciting. Might wait to see what the next iPhone brings though.",2018-08-09

662,"First off, if I have the slightest feeling or if the phone has anything wrong with it like how it functions or if the lid is cracked anywhere, I will definitely not attempt to use that phone to trade in, just because I feel like that's how large companies tend to operate their policies and terms of normal wear and tear. On any typical day I usually resell my phone with a charger and case, but thought I'd try out this trade in program for the first time. I have also enjoyed my Samsung phones and experiences with Samsung customer service. I figured the price Samsug was offering was anywhere from $50 to $150 less than the actual value of the phone being traded in to them. So I participated in the Samsung Trade In Program back on January 30, where I traded in my LG V20 in great condition without any problems or issues of any kind. On June 22, Samsung emailed me stating my phone did not meet the requirements due to damaged housing and buttons. So my Samsung credit account that I opened for the trade in program was charged $225 as they kept my trade-in phone for $25. I have emailed back and forth with Samsung customer service and at least three different representatives have responded now. Everyone responds with the same reason but no one is able to provide any kind of images or reports of any kind that prove my phone is damaged. I find this scam Samsung is pulling to be very unethical and I want to make sure I get the word out. There's no way I can continue shopping for Samsung after this issue, I only hope they improve their wrong ways and provide the service I have come to know since the Galaxy S2. One of the email responses from Samsung also included the terms of the trade in, and I thought the arbitration agreement to be interesting in this moment. Here is what it says: 11. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT Any dispute you may have with Samsung arising out of or relating to the Trade-In Program or these Terms shall be governed by the Arbitration Agreement (including its 30-day opt-out provision) included in the Samsung Terms and Conditions that apply to the New Samsung Device you purchased using the Trade-In Program. For more information about your rights, obligations, opt-out opportunities and the full terms of the Arbitration Agreement, see [ the printed materials enclosed in the box, or the Legal section of the settings menu of the New Samsung Device you purchased using the Trade-In Program (typically in the “About Device” or “About Phone” section). As stated in such Arbitration Agreement, you agree that any such dispute shall not be combined or consolidated with a dispute involving any other person’s or entity’s claim related to the Trade-In Program, and specifically, without limitation of the foregoing, shall not under any circumstances proceed as part of a class action.

672,"I have been a loyal Samsung customer for several years and are very familiar with the company as a whole. Our last purchases was a refrigerator with the Family Hub technology and an S9+ phone. We purchased the Samsung Series 8 curved TV in 2016 (UN65KS8500) and enjoyed the 4K technology along with all of the other bells and whistles. It has been a great TV until last month when the TV stopped working. It has been an experience working on getting this fixed. The Samsung customer service in a polite way told me you are on your own we can not help you because your TV is out of warranty. Note, this was a $2,400 investment (TV and sound bar) that cam highly rated by many consumer groups and people alike. At the time of purchase I did not feel like we needed an extended warranty because my two other Samsung TV's are working great (Although my oldest one we had to replace one of the boards in it and it cost \~$300 to get it fixed) and this was one of their premium TV's and \~$300 more dollars for a 3 year extended warranty seemed like a waste of money at the time. I contacted customer support again and paid for a tech to come out and take a look at the TV and he told me that the control panel was bad and it would cost $1,300 for the panel plus labor. Needless to say I was livid as to how a lightly used 2 year old TV can stop working. For the last couple of weeks I have been reviewing and posting on Samsung's community forum and to my amazement there are several people in my position with the same problem. The general consent from the Samsung moderators is, ""We are sorry to hear this"" to all of us with issues. In a nutshell they are telling us too bad, buy another TV. This TV was an investment not a disposable entity. I am horrified to think if our other products were too fail after the one year warranty was to expire. We were never asking for a replacement or to fix the TV for free but to pay for a repair greater than what the TV is worth is ridiculous! We are now considering other manufacturers if we decide to purchase another TV. What I would like to convey to you or anyone else is do your homework on all aspects of major purchases especially reliability and warranties.",2018-08-09

750,"Thanks for the info I really appreciate it. I don't have a Note 8 but I am thinking about getting the Note 9. All my Samsung devices thus far have had this issue where notifications play through both the loudspeaker and headphones when headphones are plugged in. I find it extremely annoying because I plug in my headphones not to disturb other people. So when I realised this I started putting my phone on vibrate - but then no notification sound comes through the headphones. I'm starting to believe this may be the case with all Samsung devices. If you don't believe me, try it. If you find a Samsung device that doesn't have this issue then please let me know. Dare I say the dreaded i-word...on Apple devices all sound (ringer, notifications, media) are routed through the headphones only when they are plugged in. The only exception are alarms which play though both the headphones and the loudspeaker. This might seem picky but it's everyday use cases like this that rub me the wrong way. Yes, it is possible to download third party apps to solve this issue. But I really do feel, that when you are spending this much on a device, the basics should just work out the box. Furthermore, if there are third party apps that solve this issue why can't Samsung have something in their own sound settings - according to your comment there are on certain devices. I sadly don't see this setting on J5 2016, A3 2017, S4, Note 4, or the S6. Sorry for the long comment. But I wanted to give a comprehensive reply. I may edit my question because upon reviewing it, it doesn't seem as poignant as I'd like it to be. Once again thank you for your reply. Hold me hostage if you will....",2018-08-10

When you start changing themes etc that's when you start getting overwhelmed and realise the ease of use of an iPhone. I would suggest the following. 1. Install all the apps you usually use 2. Setup your regular biometrics (iris, fingerprint etc. ) 3. As previously said in the post go to the advanced features and look through what your phone can provide. 4. Use your phone as normal and begin to get used to it After you've gotten used to your phone then you can get to know more about what it can do. Depending on how tech savvy your wife is I would let her keep using the phone in the most basic way. As for apps - Samsung has an issue of providing both the Google and Samsung related apps on the device. Samsung Email and Gmail are both present on the device, also Photos and Gallery are.

Then came the 7 with unnecessary omissions and practically nothing new to offer but still a premium price. I shifted to the nexus 6p and then the google pixel og, followed by my current note 8. Its safe to say i have used both operating systems extensively. Apple tries to unnecessarily impose their own ecosystem and paralyze the client into using them. If you have an iPhone, you have a phone which can do some extra things, you're still gonna have to be in their ecosystem to make the most out of it. If you have an android, you can do so many amazing things and so many trivial things which u cannot on an iPhone. And then, the note phones are basically a mini computer in your pocket. Majority of the android phones don't try to restrict and thats were the difference lies. If you are an iphone user, for many people they're all into it with iphone for phone related activity, the apple watch, the macbook and so on and this was working well but now they're just exploiting out of it. Many people are so used to this ecosystem that they cannot change even if they want to. I have seen, like i said before, so many iphone users wanting to switch to note 9. But they cant because of apples restrictive and exploiting eco system. And so apple can charge whatever they want and get away with it. Consider this, when you buy a note 9, you get the best android flagship out right now which has a base storage of 128gb, which can be expanded to 256 or 512. Apple says, they removed the headphone jack to make more space, Samsung made the note 9 with a headphone jack and actually increasing the battery significantly, its like they're the only company showing a middle finger to whatever apple is doing and following their own thoughts. Anyway, back to the point you buy a note 9 base model, not only do you still get a headphone jack, you also get an above average akd tuned earphones to go along with it. And not to mention your brick is fast charging. With the iPhone, not only did they remove the jack, they even removed the DONGLE from their box. And now they're capitalising on that opportunity to sell it at a high price on their website or earn money through license. And if you want fast charging? It does not come out of the box. This is mad, this is 2018, and you have to pay 50-100 bucks extra just to get fast charging in a 1000$ phone? Then theres the software, super restrictive, basic customisation is lacking. Cant do so many things that a standard android can, forget the note 9 which is basically a powerhouse. I can go on and on but people who want to buy iPhones will buy it. I wished that people had the guts to just abandon the iPhones for a year or to so that smug apple comes down from their high horse and comes back to the reality. Also, when alot of people say SPEED and processing is the concern, dont spend 1.5k or 1k or even 700$.

The only thing that held back Exynos back from galaxy devices sold in the US was CDMA tech for fall back and 1X voice and HDR Data calls.

Typical Samsung to have something amazing and still find a way to fuck it up. But the phone itself is so efficient. Little things that I missed from another operating system.

909,"Yes, it’s only a business arrangement at the time because Samsung didn’t have CDMA tech in their modems at the time, so payed for liscencing and snapdragons to launch galaxy in the US. They finally have proprietary CDMA in their modem for next year and won’t have to buy Qualcomm chip anymore if they don’t want to. Qualcomm has been making modems for 3 decades whereas Samsung entered modem market only since 2014; and unexpectedly got its baptism through fire when that years Qualcomm modem had an overheating issue which forced Samsung to launch their brand new modem with galaxy devices, and it survived. All I am saying is, to remain in context of the title, if Samsung themselves hold them back from launching their modem in the US to top tier devices, others will lack some confidence in buying them too. Given how late they entered the industry, they deserve every praise for reaching neck to neck with everyone else so quick. The new iPhone XS uses intels modem and ditched Qualcomm for the first time, who also entered modem market only 4 years ago. nVidia and HiSilicon and MediaTek are all competent and powerful modems too. Qualcomm may still have a slight performance edge, but that gap is closing fast. Samsung is also right behind Qualcomm in the 5G research and contribution to the 3GPP spec and standards, let’s see. Pretty soon we’ll see 5G and IOT capable devices and Exynos will be an equal or superior modem. Samsung’s own millions of appliances will use their own modems for IOT, so it’s a win win.

This was a good tablet with the Apple Pencil but relies too much on 3rd party apps to provide Apple Pencil support. This is where I feel Samsung has propelled their tablet with integrated spen support all over. The air commands are too handy.

I disabled the Bixby button and set Google as my voice assistance, and as I'm using a different launcher I don't accidentally activate the Bixby home screen either. Just like the OP I understand that Samsung want to include their own software in a device they made, and I believe they should be allowed to do just that. It does surprise me though that people need to use a different launcher to avoid it seeing it.",2018-10-04

You could also disable it totally with adb so it never comes back if it's bothering you so much.",2018-10-04
979,"&gt; I don't want to have to change a launcher, but that is definitely an option at the moment! I just don't understand Samsung's approach to this. I think you do understand it; you just don't agree with it. I don't agree with it either, to be clear, but I think you understand it: it's Samsung doing what any company who wants their customers to adopt their particular flavor of the month/year: they try to force it on consumers and see what sticks. Sometimes they're more obnoxious or accepting than others. Apple took 3 iterations of the iPhone to finally admit that customers wanted copy and paste. Microsoft has tried to jam Bing and Edge down our throats using various methods for years. And Samsung is using an easily (and accidentally) pressed button to try to force usage of Bixby. It's the same thing; just a different product and company. This is Samsung being Samsung. If you otherwise like their products, just buy [bxActions - Remap Buttons]( and [Package Disabler Pro]( and call it good. Yes, you have to spend around $6.50 (total) to get the phone to work the way you want. No, you shouldn't have to do this. But once you do, and spend around an hour learning how to disable Bixby, you're done. Consider it this way: how much time did it take you to write this post? While I don't doubt it was cathartic, it did take time. Also consider how much you make in an hour at your job. Does it exceed $6.50? Most likely. So you're going to spend an hour of your time making at least $6.50 to buy the apps, and another hour to learn to use them and get your phone set up the way you want. Then you're done, and can move on with your life. Is two hours of your time worth not having to deal with this? Is the price of coffee and a donut (or two) worth getting rid of this stress you're dealing with? I'd posit that it is. :-) As an aside, consider using [Nova Launcher]( No, not because of Bixby; because it's a much better launcher with many nice options. You don't have to, but I'll bet you'll like it better. Yes, it's worth the $0.99 upgrade to Prime, but you can try it before you do so don't worry about that. Also use the Samsung Apps app to download Good Lock and its associated apps. They're all free and offer a ton of nice functionality options.",2018-10-04
980,"The problem is that you shouldn’t have to turn it off every time SE updates. That’s ridiculous. If I turned it off I made that decision for a reason. It should remain disabled until the user changes it. No custom launcher or extra app should be required to turn off such a pointless and intrusive feature, because that is what it is. I turned it off plenty more times than I updated SE and that’s what made me give up on Samsung. On iOS I expect something to be shoved down my throat, but that’s not android-style at all, that’s why 99% of all people claim they get an android “freedom of choice”. Samsung just removes that freedom.",2018-10-04
981,"In short? Is a dark pattern. Longer version: In user experience design (the design of a product or service from the perspective of usability and accessibility rather than just aesthetics), there's a concept called a ""pattern"". This means a design or style of a particular interface that allows someone to do something. Translated into real world terms, an example would be the way a particular app allows you to type in text, or adjust your volume, or upload a file. On the web, a UX pattern might be how a particular website allows you to login, or the process by which you would add a product to your shopping cart, choose to check out, and then finalize your purchase. There's another concept, not as commonly discussed: a dark pattern. This is a UX (user experience) decision that is made to serve the purposes of the company and priorities this decision over (and sometimes to the exclusion of) goals or desires of a user. An example of this is a site that requires you to make an account and login before they will allow you to view their content (even when it's free), or that keeps bothering you with pop ups asking you to allow notifications or to sign up for a mailing list. Sometimes this is just poor design. However, when the company is aware of an intended goal of the user, and interrupts that goal in order to push an alternative desired by the company on the user instead, that is when poor design becomes a dark pattern. What you are experiencing here is a dark pattern. You want to just use your phone, if you want Google Assistant to be your default virtual assistant. Samsung would rather you use Bixby instead. They are so determined to try to ""help"" you make this decision that they are degrading the user experience in order to accomplish that goal. No, it's not usually considered wise by those of us who designed user experiences. Unfortunately, we are only the ones making the recommendations, not the ones making the decisions. You can thank Samsung corporate product management/ownership for that. So that's the ""why"". Yes, it's stupid. But it's the way it is, has been, and will be for the foreseeable future. It isn't just Samsung; it is true of most large organizations on the planet.",2018-10-04

Get the Samsung branded charger which comes with all three. Qi quick charge isn't the same as other fast chargers, which rely on higher-ampere power bricks. Qi quick charge relies on higher voltage to do its job. If the phone believes that the pad, cable, or power brick isn't capable, it won't quick charge. As for the memory, the available RAM seems about right. On an android phone, the amount of RAM available can be small, as the OS will use as much of it as possible for cache.

1058,The N850 is expenaive. And if atmos wont work for you. I would save the money. And look at other options. The soundtouch 300 is a great bar. And the price is dropping. As the soundbar 700 is coming. Sub is a bit expensive. The bose sub is pricey. But the system is very good. You might want to look at the samsung hw-ms750 or ms650 if you if atmos will not work for you ceiling. And get the swa-w700 subwoofer. As it will sound good without atmos. It will be cheaper. And work good. But if you want to use music and tv bar. The bose is better option. As the bose music system is better then the samsung. But if music is not as important for the bar. The samsung ms750 or ms650 would be a good option.,2018-10-07

But since your ceiling are not good for atmos. You are better off looking at the samsung hw-ms750 or hw-ms650. Either with the swa-w700 sub will sound good at a lot lower price of then n850. And for tv and movie. The are just as good as the bose. And cheaper with the subwoofer. They are not as good as the bose with music as the samsung multiroom app is not that good and the samsung satillite spearkers are no where as good as the bose. But the bar sound are just as good. The ms750 has a huge sound stage like the bose.,2018-10-07

Now, the earbuds sounds amazing, yes amazing, is like 75% of the akg's volume,bass is enough, mids and highs sounds good and can cause ear problems if you go all the way, now,thanks to the noise cancellation the volume don't need to be that high. Today i used the iconx to a level never expected, since I'm using it longer than before i put a giant playlist on the iconx memory, the battery lasted from 10:15 am till 4:45 with 5% remaining of battery, according to Samsung 4 to 5 hours is estimated time it should lasted if the music is onboard, if you talk and stream music from the phone the iconx normally last like 3.5 to 4 hours unstop. The case provides another full charge, and charges pretty fast, use usb-c so since you have an N8 is one less cable to worry about. Love the controls can be used in both sides, you can change the volume, songs, play list, voice control etc in any of the earbuds. The water proofing is top notch. Again about the noise cancellation, is smazing, you can ride the trains or been anywhere and theres no ambient noise that can get to your ear, you're completely isolated from the world. Oh but don't worry, the iconx have some kind of microphone that can be activated and set for higher or lower settings that allows you to listen yours surrounding, even have a voice boost so it recognizes and amplifies human voices. Portability is great, you can jump, twist your hear like the exorcist and the iconx will stay put and sounding great. What i hate ? Would love a 8+ hours battery life. If i would buy it again ?

Around 8 months ago i was talking to my friend and he told me how angry he was on android with so many customizations that was hard for him to keep it up (he was an apple user b4) i told him that was good because he can get a phone tailored to his need, after defending why apple charged him 60$ for a fast charger that has been free for years and still faster on samsung he told me ""i need no options"" i just told him this: if you father is a buss driver why are you're studing in college ? Why ? because you love your father but you don't need to be a copy of him, you wanna do your own stuff. That's called options.

It has only one charge but if you not use the buds all the way the case will add that battery life and stop charging so it's doesn't waste the charge.. But basicly I charge the case every 4-5-6 days.. Touch controls are pretty good so you don't have to pull out the phone all the time.. Walking/running tracking works surprisingly fine .. I did watched some other comparisons and for their price range these are usually in the top..

1331,"Speed in phones isn't all. Firstly you guys dropped the fingerprint sensor... for a notch... You use Samsung OLED technology and pretty much pass it off as an apple innovation, OLED comes froom 2002 or somewhere close to that. Apple will last longer, with less features, be more polished and cost more. Samsung will last 2-3 years, more features, can be buggier, can game better than Iphones due to their superior GPUs, have better useability (headphone jack, USB-C etc.) Apple phones do maintain their value, but if you have a trade in plan it makes no difference, or if you use it until it dies it makes no difference. Repairing an S-Device is cheaper than an Apple device. The Samsung eco-system co-ensides with the Andriod one making it much more universal for the mainstream PC users, or anyone who does enterprise/business/server based work. I can run python code on it for example. Even if you have those issues you stated with S-deives, try the pixel. Pixels are supperior to Apple devices in nearly everyway, (excluding the XL's notch, eww) Firstly, the products last, they get supported for just as long as Apple devices, they get the BEST ecosystem currently available, they are nearly as fast as an IPhone, have a fingerprint sensor and face scanning, etc. etc. Again, Apple has its place for people who do not want a feature rich phone, someone who wants a super easy to use device and cannot follow the Andriod ecosystem. However they're overpriced, practically scam you at repairs (do I need to get Louis Rossman?) The ONLY component that is worse on andriod devices is the CPU, EVERYTHING else equal, or in some cases better, take the batteries, I don't know ANY flagship andriod phone that came out this year with a smaller battery. I don't know of ANY andriod phone that came out this year without an SD card reader. Again, personal preferance, but I like to be able to tinker with my device, if you wish to not do that then fine.

The longer answer is that the notches allegedly cost less to manufacture (possibly due to where / how the display is connected to the board), and patents for things like curved displays can be prohibitively expensive or impossible for other companies to license from Samsung. Samsung also has tremendous manufacturing capability; their fabrication facilities are much larger than most of their competitors.

Samsung Experience feels years ahead of stock Android. As far as your downsides, I agree with you on Bixby. I never use assistants ever - I'm usually in a public setting where I feel weird talking to my phone, it's usually faster to just use the touchscreen instead, and speech to text isn't super accurate. I never use Bixby or Assistant, and I wish I could do things without assistants getting shoved in my face - Cortana, Assistant, Bixby, Alexa, etc. Just no. I however love the Bixby button; after remapping it with bxActions, it's so great to have a hardware back button. I could never go without that button anymore. I do love the 18:9 aspect ratio. My phone is about the same physical size as my previous Pixel XL, but it has waaaaay more screen real estate. I love it, it's great for browsing Reddit or watching TV.

Basically, while the TV is on, press and hold the Exit button on the Samsung remote control for 12 seconds, after which the TV should display a warning dialog which you can use the remote control to choose ""OK"" on which does a full factory reset. With that said, I'm in agreement here with others that the image you're seeing is likely somehow coming from your cable provider, since it only appears when you apparently have the cable connected to the back of the set.

I've learned that many samsung devices do very poorly with software as its upgraded. When someone comes in with a Note 3 / S5 its typically a stun if they work well. I've been a note person since the Note3 and never had issues because I changed my phone yearly. Most people cant do that.

1449,"Thanks for the follow-up, it's quite an intriguing situation indeed. I think you should trust the Mobile Data Usage over the Secure Folder app regarding the bandwidth consumption, many other users report large amount of data usage (visible on their telco website and bills!), despite the Secure Folder app saying it's not using anything. I think the Secure Folder feature on Samsung phones is only meant to provide minimum data security against random smartphone thieves off the street, stealing a corporate (or [BYOD/COPE/POCE]( device, not knowing it's not just a strictly personal one. Looking at Knox various products, they all seem geared toward one goal: allowing corporations to restrict, backup, lock, locate and remote-wipe a fleet of devices. It does not protect against invasive surveillance agencies, big corps spying on home users, or fully-fledged industrial espionage. &amp;#x200B; From what I gathered, *Secure Folder* is basically making all Samsung smartphone users an *employee* of the Samsung corp, in a Knox environment: **Samsung** can backup, lock, locate and remote-wipe all ""their"" Samsung devices, not the users themselves. So, while as an *employee* of the Samsung corp, you can ask them to do all these actions for you, by logging in on your Samsung account - they're still the ones with all the admin rights and access to the Knox tools installed on ""your"" device. **The user is definitely not the admin** here, despite being the legal owner of the smartphone (as a physical good). \_\_\_ PS: thinking a little more about it, it's the sort of trade-off that usually comes with a seemingly ""free"" service: with *Secure Folder*, the user does not need to set up their own backup/remote-lock/wipe server, nor do all the maintenance work (patching, tweaking, etc), nor pay anyone to do that job for them - but in return the user does not control the system's settings at all: **Samsung got all the keys** and do whatever they want with these. At this point, *if you're not using your own encryption tools,* it's choosing between giving your confidential data to a potential thief (if the device ever gets stolen or lost), or giving it to *Samsung &amp; Associates* right from the start. It reminds me of security products (like BitDefender) installing [Man In The Middle]( exploits on their users' devices, to see their encrypted traffic, to supposedly analyze it and detect any malware/phishing attempts: what is the point of a security software, if it bring such a massive vulnerability to the device? Here, what is the point of securing confidential data, if it's only to give it all to *Samsung &amp; Associates* ? I can't even imagine how incredibly powerful an unlimited access to Samsung's Knox servers would be: accessing the most valuable data of millions of devices, with an automatic updating service keeping the data fresh and accurate.",2018-11-06

1502,"It seems like a pretty straightforward answer - ipad pro. Maybe it is in general. &amp;#x200B; BUT...here's my two cents (note: I haven't used any ipad pros, nor any chromebooks) I never understood this 'productivity tablet' thing. Especially for a 10"" device. I don't know how good ipad pro is at various tasks, but it seems like a niche productivity device - it's good at drawing and various other graphics work, at least the 13"" version. Everything else is just marketing mumbo jumbo to get you to buy the crazy expensive garbage keyboards. Maybe it's also good at note taking and things like that, but that is where Samsung excels as well. For me personally, S4 beats the ipad because it's a far better media consumer device - screen ratio, amoled &gt; 120Hz, storage expandability. Plus, I love DEX as well. I don't understand this 'apps not updated for tablet'\* thing. Built-in apps are awesome. Plex runs fine, Kodi and VLC as well and I use Telegram without any issues. All in all, I find this device to sit deeply in the 'better than the sum of its parts' territory. &amp;#x200B; I also got the POGO dock for the S4 for cheap (\~$30). Currently the daily board is just a glorified photo frame, if that, but supposedly S4 will get Bixby voice in 2019, and I hope they improve the daily board to act more as a smart display. One good thing about the POGO dock is that it's as good as wireless chargers, in that you just place the tab in it and it charges. It takes a couple of attempts to learn how to quickly lock the pins, but after that it just, well, clicks :). One great downside of the dock is that you can't use it with Samsung's covers. I have a book cover (non-keyboard) and it covers the pogo pins as well, and even if it didn't, it makes the thing too thick to fit in the slot. &amp;#x200B; \*I never here this argument raised for Chromebooks BTW.

That's a substantial amount of work per phone model. Another reason is they want and need people to switch from note 8 to note 9 and before OneUI I don't think anyone can really justify an upgrade from the note 8 to note 9. That's just my opinion on this specific issue. I still receive updates on my s6 that I use as a backup. But thankfully they don't try to push UI updates like Apple does killing the battery life and speed of the older phones.

1570,"&gt;Now, we don’t have any reason yet to doubt the validity of this report, but given what we know this simply raises a lot of questions. One UI is Samsung’s new UX that’s based on Android 9 Pie, just like Samsung Experience 9.0 was Samsung’s UX for Android 8.0 Oreo and Samsung Experience 9.5 was their UX for Android 8.1 Oreo. Samsung has previously confirmed that Android Pie would be coming to the Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8, and a handful of A series and J series phones. It seems unlikely that Samsung would backtrack on releasing Android Pie for the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy Note 8, but it also seems unlikely to us that they would roll out an Android Pie update without the new interface changes in One UI. After all, that would mean Samsung has to maintain multiple versions of their Android Pie software, and not just add/remove whatever features they deem inaccessible for older devices. &gt;It is possible that the spokesperson gave out incomplete information, so we reached out to Samsung Mobile for clarification and will update this article if we hear back from them.

1611,"On the every company will adopt this but Samsung being first note, aren’t most companies already trying to be predictive and gesture based to improve navigation anyways? Like just within stock Android P there are so many gestures, predictive actions and google assistant triggers to help minimize user interaction . In the cases of contacts and clock, a lot of the top UI elements are elements you shouldn't want to interact with frequently. Contacts for example, the button on the top prevents accidental activation of edits while also freeing up space and clutter from the bottom for things you actually use. If you want an example for how cluttering around the bottom can lead to confusion, just look at iOS 12's messages app, almost all the actions are on the bottom half of the screen, all the iMessage apps, media inputs and of course the keyboard. Yes, everything is reachable, but all the different menu tabs and layers just make everything confusing. I think that while the gesture ideas from One UI are a move in the right step, just plain moving everything to the bottom but having pop-ups and layers is just silly. iOS's implementation of bars at the bottom of most apps, first or third party still looks to work well compared to Android's top accessible side menus. Having the most important actions on the bottom - great, putting everything down there - confusing. Though my opinion may not matter, my fingers are long enough to handle a Note 9 or a XS Max in one hand. FYI, Apple still has their guidelines, now renamed the Human Interface Guidelines, available for macOS, iOS, tvOS and WatchOS. TLDR, gestures already work for most of the screen and predictive suggestions are already working on reducing user actions anyways. Is Samsung really first?",2018-11-09

When you start scrolling, conversations fill up the whole screen regardless.. Same with Bixby screen. Why do I need huge Hi, Name on the top? I get that it moves content down but I rather have more, nicely laid out content and information than black space. &amp;#x200B; It's not some big revolution, iOS figured it out from the beginning when it comes to one handed use. have tabs on the bottom, use swipe gestures anywhere to go back, have interaction menus on the bottom, etc. When Google introduced tabs on the top, at least at first they supported swiping between them, but with time they retracted all that and now with MD2 their apps are shifting to what UI/UX that iOS has been using for ages. I don't blame them, it just works, especially with constantly increasing phone sizes. Now Samsung realizes that it is the way to go as well. &amp;#x200B; It was just funny to see Samsung talk about improving UX and essentially showing how they are making their skin more and more like iOS. Again don't get me wrong, I like change but I think they want to put a spin on what iOS has been doing for years, but I don't think it is functionally better.

Samsung, on the other side, designs Exynos SoC with built in modem and the custom cores (like Apple) but then **it is Samsung themselves that make** the chip. Unfortunately, due to Qualcomm and some US carriers, the Samsung modem can't be in the US phones, so Samsung has to put a Qualcomm chip in the US version of the phone. By doing this you won't get a fully designed by Samsung hardware.

I went from a Note 8 to iPhone X. So far these are the cons I can think of when moving back. Camera is pretty much the same shit. Both are amazing.

As far as R&amp;D is concerned, up until the SD 835 generation, the Exynos SoCs were actually more powerful than the other counterparts (excluding the bionic chips from Apple). It is only with the 845 that Snapdragon caught up with Exynos in terms of raw CPU power. So, qualcomm actually isn't the industry leading ARM chip manufacturer you think it is.",2018-11-09

As for the other issues I'd say most of them applied to the S9 plus when it was released but were fixed for the Note 9 when that was released. The Note 9 definetly has one of the best smartphone cameras but I'd suggest watching a few camera comparison videos. One thing to keep in mind is you can download the Google Pixel camera apk (or something like that) that actually works pretty great but it's not the Samsung stock camera app so you'll lose some features.,2018-11-10

Meaning its actually safer to use Samsung Pay rather than your actual card. It will use a random 16 digit number each time! I run into people who think you are more susceptible to identity theft, but the tokenization protects your personal information.

1685,"So, hi. &amp;#x200B; We know. S-Voice was never designed to be a proper voice assistant. It was built and put into product roadmaps as a way to do text-to-speech commands, like ""Call mom"" or ""Send a text"". Those functions are basic requirements for the hardware category, so if Bixby wasn't ready or couldn't be supported by hardware planned for 1-2 years out, it got S-Voice, which was developed many years ago. Retrofitting Bixby onto those devices is, unfortunately, lower priority than trying to make it work well on the primary devices (i.e. phone and TV). Samsung is big, but it doesn't have infinite time and resources. &amp;#x200B; As for Bixby, the plan is eventually for everything to have it. Watches, TV, fridge, all connected to the same voice assistant, tied to your Samsung Account and Samsung Cloud. All talking to each other, subtly learning in the background when to turn on lights, what Youtube videos to suggest in your feed, etc. But Bixby was basically rebuilt after the S8 when Viv ([ ) was integrated, so when specs and roadmap for various products were being design, the choice was either put the 1.0 version of Bixby into the Galaxy Watch, Iconx, etc, only for them to be obsolete and out of step with the New Bixby on the phone by the time they came out, or to focus efforts on a single experience for the next generation. We chose the latter. If you watch DJ Koh's presentation at our developer's conference, that's the vision he laid out. &amp;#x200B; Other ecosystems aren't exactly nailing this right now either. Trying to set an alarm on a Google Home vs on your phone will show you that they don't interact at all. Siri is just a straight up mess between the Apple TV, Watch, and HomePod (which is missing the vast majority of functionality). No one uses Alexa on their phones, even if they use it daily on their Echo. Etc. Everyone is about a generation behind where consumers want us to be. &amp;#x200B; But we're working on it.",2018-11-30

You can use AVG free (antivirus, seems the least intrusive), and I'd be careful with torrent apps if your not familiar. Your ISP or carrier could send you a naughty note, or kick you off. If you stream movies, you're in the clear. •Use Samsung Pay. You might as well get free stuff for money you are already spending, and its secure. If your bank card isn't supported, you can add your PayPal. You're gonna get alot of ""We don't take Apple Pay"", but Samsung Pay uses MST so it will work almost anywhere you can swipe. Always select credit on the pay station, you've already pinned in on the phone. •Set up secure folder. If you use your phone for work/personal, it's a good way to seperate your gallery, email apps, notes, etc. Or, maybe, you just want to hide shit. You can use it for that too. You hide or disguise the icon. You can also set up a dedicated fingerprint for it, so one finger opens the regular home, and the other opens secure folder. It also has a self destruct if passcode is entered incorrectly too many times. •Bixby works....if you work on it. I feel like people complain about it, but mine works great. It's as smart as you make it though. If you ""teach"" it when it understands incorrectly or does the wrong command, it learns and corrects. If you don't, it won't.

The S8 sold for the same price as the S9 during their releases so I can only assume it would be the same or similar for the S10 and the S11.

AKA useless if you're looking for a pen-and-paper experience). The current S4 will be out of your price range, but the older S3 is definitely a strong contender. There's also a Tab A 10.1 with S-Pen, but that model also comes in a much more widely avalable penless model so if that's something you're interested in buying make sure you're not confusing one model for the other. S-Pens will only work on certain devices because those devices have an additional hardware layer as a screen component, so you can't just buy a random cheapo tablet and hope that an S-Pen will work on it. The Tab A with S-Pen has 3GB of RAM compared to the normal one's 2 GB but other than that (and obviously the higher price for the former) they're basically the same.

I was using a dollar store cable and an Alcatel 2.0amp wall block, and if I restarted my phone while it was charging, it would give the moisture error. It would make sense that the S9 detects ""moisture"" by detecting an unexpected voltage/amperage/charging abnormality of any sort. Switched to the oem samsung wall block and still using the dollar store cord, and so far so good. I do believe this feature is less than perfect, and this won't be everyone's fix, but if all else fails, please try the oem block (and cord, probably).",2018-12-03

1793,"I bought a phone recently (got it just yesterday) and my choice was between Huawei P20 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S9+ (not the same, but similar). Generally speaking, Huawei phones have bigger battery, faster charging, faster updates and usually lower price point. However, I don't like EMUI (their skin on top of Android). It just feels... Chinese. About the camera... A lot of people argue that P20 Pro and Mate 20 Pro have the best cameras out there (they even hold the high score on DxO Mark), but this depends. They take incredible photos, especially at night, but they oversharpen a lot and IMO the photos don't look natural. Samsung phones have better screen, better build quality, better performance and IMO (and according to a lot of people) better software. Overall they're just better phones - even if they don't stand out that much with a certain feature, they're better all-rounders. However, since you're an Apple user, you might find the Samsung software a bit too alien (Huawei's EMUI is closer to iOS). I bought the S9+ eventually and I'm super happy. A girl I'm dating bought recently the P20 Pro and I know that if I bought it, I would have made a compromise simply because of the low light camera. *Edit: Removed the part where EMUI has more features - I'm not actually sure if this is true.*",2018-12-05

However, youll have worse camera, slower charging, worse cpu (Huawei's kirin is really good, much better than snapdragon or the exynos.) Also will mention, the Huawei has better face recognition, Indisplay fingerprint reader (if you care) and note 9 has the fingerprint reader at the back.

1796,"I have the exact same problem and searched a lot about it. I think there is no solution to this, unfortunately. Even changing the subtitles to grey or yellow does not help a lot, on netflix for example you can set the subtitles to be semi-transparent but it only works on SDR content. HDR will ignore this setting and show a full-strong coloured subtitle. I understand that edge-lit displays do not have the best local dimming of the market but the bright subtitles on very dark scenes ruins the experience. The whole display ""lights up"" when someone speaks and the subtitle appears and then it goes back to the appropriate darkness when no one is speaking (no subtitles). It's very noticiable and very annoying but I don't think Samsung will do anything about this ever. All the ""solutions"" that you can find on the internet impact on the HDR performance (lowering the overall backlight, enabling ECO, etc.) I also have a Q6F and this is my only regret about this TV. Ozark on Netflix is a great example of the poor handling of subtitles on HDR dark scenes.

Chose to buy an unlocked Note 9 for $200 off and chose the Samsung financing option to pay for the phone. Little did I know the billing information has to match the shipping information or else they'll cancel your order. So my order status gets changed to cancel so I call customer support to call to find out what went wrong. They told me I had to call the financing company to change the billing address so that's what I did. Called TD Ameritrade on Sat &amp; used their automated prompt to change my billing address. Wait another 3 days until Tues thinking my order will finally process and get changed to shipped. Nope, Samsung cancels my order again because they say the address they have on file is still my old address and not the new one that TD Ameritrade has. They tell me to wait 7 business days (12/04) to see if anything updates on their end as the computer automatically generated the order so it might correct itself. I even check TD Ameritrade login with my online account &amp; it shows my NEW updated billing address. So I call Samsung again and ask if they will honor my 20% discount since it shows in their system I had 2 cancelled orders. The representative tells me I am able to add the unlocked Note 9 to my cart and once the order goes through they can credit me back the $200 in the form of a refund. Well little did I know that I am going to go through the same frustrating process again. Place my order for a 3rd time and their system STILL shows that my billing address and shipping address don't match. I am at my wit's end in trying to order a phone from them because they should be able to manually update their database for any changes in billing address since TD Ameritrade reflects the new address change. Called customer support explaining to them that I think my order is going to get cancelled again for a THIRD time because of their incompetence to comprehend what information I am trying to relay to them.

As you get all the way around the screen you lift it off slowly and disconnect the little tabs. Looks to be around 3 of them. One at the top, side and bottom. (Push in or pop off type connecters) Put new screen in place, attach connectors and seal up with the pre applied sticky tape around the edges of the new screen. Fixing the frame is another story. You will always have those dents but you will have a working screen. If you have insurance then claim via that. Typically £60 excess if not repair it yourself.

It's probably close to the price to do it yourself or take it somewhere and with them you'll get your phone back in to warranty for whatever is left on it. It's hard to tell by the picture but if the phone is majorly warped, there may be damage on the motherboard and they may not be able to fix it. Just a heads up.",2018-12-05

Google backup attempts to do some of these things but I have noticed it will not neccessarily backup all the corrects apps and text messages especially.

1882,yea it's pretty clear what's happening. it's like the 7+ planes that were brought down by the iPhone while no one cared until it was the note 7 I can keep going and it doesn't have to end with just planes. there are lots of gory photos too. but Google it. you won't find this issue when audio jacks and power jacks weren't merged because audio jacks weren't capable of delivering this kind of voltage. you will find people getting static shocks etc from ipods incidentally people have been safely using audio jacks for about a hundred years in one form or another and there was no reason to eliminate them. apple started the trend because they are crazy patent licensing hawks the implication isn't that is was specifically Apple but that merging the audio jack and the power jack is a terrible idea as people already knew I can charge another phone with my phone. the power jack is capable of driving way more power than is necessary to deliver audio but just enough to get your head to explode if audio jacks were as much of a risk before you'd imagine 100+ watt power amps with audio jacks would be making lots of head lines. shoot TVs used to have audio jacks.

1894,"If AC 110/220V passed through your phone's internals it would fry anything and everything attached to it. Dongle or not. Most headphones jacks are placed on the same PCB as the charging port even on Samsung devices. The Audio adapter has a DAC, it draws a little bit of current from the battery and that's it. You aren't connecting your headphones to the power source directly. There is a very small chance for the dongle's circuitry to overheat and get fried, and even then, the 5V will not cause any damage to your ears let alone kill you. Apple just moved the entire circuitry outside the phone to make it a hassle and force people to buy their wireless accessories. So long as the damage is in the dongle and not the wall adapter. You are safe. TL;DR regardless of what phone you have, it is never a good idea to use it while charging because it could overheat ,short circuit and then ignite. Wearing earphones when this happens will be even more catastrophic.

1901,the iPhone 7 was released in 2016. just like with the note 7 phones have been exploding since the dawn of cell phones. but it wasn't happening as frequently until phone batteries reached a certain threshold which is why phone companies began adding more safeguards with Samsung even adding a vapor cooling system. you're digging back at incidents that occurred once even 2 or 3 years while we've already had 3 cases this year alone while the entire pc board can fry and become conductive the odds increase with however small the circuit is and in the last 2 years the trend has been merge the circuits,2018-12-09
1902,"Look at the bottom board, the USB C port and the Headphone jack are on the same board. And that board is connected to the main IC with a small ribbon connector where the pins are 0.5 millimeters apart. I'm not shitting on Samsung phones, I still think they're the best phones available. But this is normal in most phones in order to reduce the overall size. Take a screwdriver to the charging port of an S9 or an iPhone X, nothing will happen. Because they are designed to survive short circuits. Apple just moved part of that bottom board out of the phone. To ""save space"" The USB DAC (Dongle) isn't really software controlled, it uses the data lines for the audio signal and draws a couple of milliamps from the charging line. Can the DAC get overheated by drawing too much current? Yes. Is it likely? No. There is circuitry intended to limit current and the DAC itself will just get damaged and not work before it could harm you. People buying cheap dongles will, in the worst case scenario , have the entire 5V 2A pass to their headphones which will just damage the internal drivers and they would have to be replaced. The only way it would be lethal is if you have a faulty adapter that wrongly sends the entire AC Voltage to your phone, at this point it does not matter if you have the headphone jack on a dongle, at the bottom of the phone or the top of the phone.

There are several variants of the Note 9 specific to various regions and they all have different capabilities for accessing cellular networks (specifically, the bands and frequencies).

This isn't too big of a problem for me since I'm mostly on wifi doing internet-connected tasks rather than calls and SMS and I'm willing to put up with it because I need the dual-sim functionality, but this may cause significant issues if you rely on these basic features. TL;DR international models of Samsung phones that were purchased online are not fully compatible with North American telco networks due to bands and frequencies.

1946,"&gt;The headphone jack is still part of the circuitry, it's just not soldered on. This is to help with repairs. Still in case of a short circuit, it will pass the current through the headphone jack. &gt; &gt;I understand what you mean by buffer, it is like having a mini fuse built in. But my point is that the Dongle is literally moving the internal circuitry (DAC and Port) outside , the S9 also has a DAC built in the phone. &gt;The dongle to charging port interface is the same as the S9's daughter board to main board. &gt; &gt;Is there any advantage to this? Sort of. There is a possibility of having a higher quality DAC and driving more demanding headphones (higher impedance). and audio will sound very similar across every device because the DAC is the same. But you could do this on the S9 as well whilst keeping the headphone jack. &gt; &gt;The disadvantages are far more though, more wear on the port, more failure points (not lethal), can't listen to music without a dongle. Etc etc. &gt; sure granted some freak accident lightning strikes your house etc then it won't matter but having a thin gauge only enough to pass 3v between your phone and your audio jack is a good idea as is having an audio jack. if headphone cables were comprised of the same amount of metal I would bet there'd no how way for a lethal dose of electricity to pass through. and while you're right maybe offboard dacs could be better but doesn't that just pass the buck? if the industry got away with providing only the most baseline dac and then expected the consumer to pay to play Russian roulette with dongles they're still providing another unnecessary need for a point of failure. the s7 had don't have USB c. particularly the snapdragon one because was hated among audiophiles because it was both shouth and thin. the S8 however hadded a dedicated dac and sounds great in my opinion if not quite as loud as I'd want. we've reached similar to the late 90s with cd players that most are quite good with the only real limitation being volume which isn't really an issue for most people. all I see are dishonest reasons for why ""we"" benefit from the dropping of the headphone jack, the worst being that ""its out dated"" which is just a fox news style claim. ""theres dongle for that"" slogan is anti consumer. the iPhone 7 added a spacer where the audio jack would have been that's ironically the same size and rough shape as an audio jack. it's literally plastic piece. the apple excuse never made sense. first they claimed it was to allow the device to be water resistant which was clearly ignoring innovation from other sources again. then it was about saving space which still doesn't seem to be probably given that there are devices smaller and thinner than the iPhone 7 that handle their audio jack fine. it's annoying how many times ever since Apple dropped theirs did the media claim that everyone else would copy them which is a cheap way to claim that Apple was being innovative and others needed to ""catch up"". for Apple it meant selling a lot more dongle. licenses and for the rest of us just meant a firewall between audio production and consumption. all the reasons the people are told have been bullshit with the truth being something closer to ""they wanted save a few cents. they wanted to sell dongles with lightnkng port licensing etc. but the best way is still to allow people to have the option of the more reliable audio jack while still having the device capable of USB c audio as well as Bluetooth advancements . sure the dongle removed the charger from the phone so now the power is being handled by the dongle which also should in its best base scenario prevent the power from unloading through the audio port but I bet you these singles are likely hardwired to be cheap and compact rather than modular as the s9 is. the thing that would be at risk of burning our isn't even the phone anymore but the dongle which would explain why only one of the dbejfes one seen features a charred phone and that have been one ages ago. &gt; &gt;Regardless of what phone you use, I guarantee you will suffer the same consequences if the charger decides to pass the AC Voltage through the cable. &gt; maybe it's shock my hand but I really doubt that tiny ribbon band would be capable of carrying enough current to cause someone's head to explode. if you grab some speaker voice cable and lie 4 side by side in ribbon formation you'll quickly burn the wires out if you try to send more than 9v over them. In tech you fan use they as an easy way to cut and toast bread at the same time.. if the ribbon cable managed to merge with the board and the board itself became conductive then yea you'd die. but all these little safe guards are useful. I don't see any reason why anyone would choose to follow Apples example at all. apple gains by licensing and drm protection with no more loop hole ports. android companies just seem to be doing it to copy Apple pressured by the audio industry to further lock down drm via an all digital audio output route. the drm thing doesn't make as much sense since you can easily download any file onto an android anyway. I have a Google pixel 2 dongle and it's dac is pretty bad so now it's just collecting dust. &gt;Now, if there is a short circuit in your cable itself and you are using an original charger, you will be safe because they are designed to handle worn cables that will inevitably have a short. This is what will happen with the lightning adapter in the worst case scenario. on a wing or a prayer. the audio jack is separated from the board by a very thin ribbon cable with small. copper connections. the lightning port is still a combination port capable of sending or receiving power just like the USB c port which on galaxies are also an option. you don't see too many people buying enhanced powered USB or lightning port headphones though so I'm starting to think that was never really an idea. &gt; &gt;You will find many incidents of people in third world countries buying cheap Chinese adapters(Wall plug) and then getting their ears burnt along with their earphones after the adapter short circuits. And none of these were due to a faulty dongle, in fact most were even before 2016. you can find isolated incidence about once every 2 or 3 years going back to it looks like 2014 but there has been a shocking rise in reports in 2018 alone and more on begween 2016 and 2018. the flack Samsung gets for not following the ""new way"" is unethical and its a good thing that the audio jack which is the most versatile port there is being just a low-voltage unamplified version of the same copper connection that loud speakers a d musicians use. the audio jack is the last industrial grade jack and I hope the trend of trying to fall it obsolete dies before it causes more problems. while your headphones are plugged into your charging port don't you think it's a little scary that a piece of a malicious software could just switch the output to max? save guards be damned. where there's a will there's a way. a nice handy 3v output audio jack is great and I hope people are fooled into having it be dropped in favor of dongles. and granted I'm am biased. if the mediu continue to say this things like ""while Samsung still insists on featuring the audio jack"" ąs if well all be excited when we lose it.",2018-12-11

1968,"Unfortunately, Samsung does not have a global warranty particularly because of different processors being used in different regions. In this case, your phone has a snapdragon where in Asian countries the Exynos variant is used. The official Samsung repair center in Japan would not be able to repair your phone because when they open the device and if somehow they mess one of the circuits in the PBA (basically your motherboard of your phone) and if they can't replace the part like for like, it won't pass quality check. My advice would be to take it to a 3rd party repairer if its just the screen. Granted, they might not use original Samsung parts but it will do as a temporary fix. Having said that, 3rd party repairers can get really expensive because of the curved screen. Hope this helps.",2018-12-12
1969,"I think there are some SOP in Samsung to have replacement parts on hand in case the repair guy screws up. Of course if Samsung screws up your repair, not only the manager will probably have a pay cut but also they will have to pay you lots of money to not get sued. Whereas is some 3rd party dude fried your motherboard, he probably just give you a new phone and tell you to GTFO, with all your information lost. Please don't take my answer the main reason why Samsung decides not to repair your phone.",2018-12-12
1970,"I don't think you really understand how the whole process works. If there was a way, Samsung would rather repair your phone because they make money off repairs as well. The fact that they cannot and not just in Japan but globally for devices bought in other regions indicates that there are challenges from a legal and infrastructural point of view. Also, yes displays are identical. Again, try to understand, what I'm trying to say is if they f*ck up your repair they can't replace your phone like for like just because they don't sell Snapdragon variants in Japan, and part of the quality check process is to make sure that the device repaired is like brand new otherwise that gives customers the chance to sue Samsung. Hope this helps.",2018-12-12

Each country/geographic region has it's own Samsung division that is essentially it's own company that is in turn owned by Samsung Group in Korea. As such, each regional Samsung only stocks parts and can only service devices from it's own territory. Additionally, the S7 Edge has the charging board integrated into the screen assembly. This charging board has other hardware in it, including antenna connections. A board from Japan will only work with Japanese S7 Edge. Finally on some models, there are slight differences in the main board and/or screen connector between carrier / regions. This means that a Japanese screen connector may not even align or connect to your main board. Your best course of option is shipping the device to Samsung in the region it was originally manufactured for if you want Samsing to fix it.

CVE replaced the motherboard and data link, and ran QA diagnostics indicating the device was in complete working order on a service receipt. Then I got that mess when I powered it on for the first time since receiving it 2 days ago, and it's only gotten worse. Samsung phone support was on holiday until today. Samsung online told me to contact CVE, which has not actually been available on calling, nor returned calls from leaving information. UPS does not deal directly with the receiver in these matters. I believe Samsung Care initiated a UPS claim today, but I've never been involved in this process before and don't know how the investigation works, or how they followup based on the findings. It's been a huge pain and I had to amazon prime order a cheap laptop to use in the interim, but I'm hoping it'll be resolved.",2019-01-02

It looks fancy but that was a few years before so many other options became available. Younger people don't do much with iMessage as of late. It is more of a gimmick than a killer feature. As for Apple, the phones they sell are solid and they support updates for at least four years. The iPhone resale values are much better. The CPU is faster, sound from the speakers is better, and support for bluetooth headphones is better. Also, you can't beat the ecosystem. Everything really does work well together. Truth is, you won't be sorry with the switch to an iPhone. It is a terrific platform. If you want to stay with Android though, you won't be able to beat Samsung. I prefer Android for its customizability, expandable memory, and tons of options for available devices. Updates are terrific with Samsung as of late, and I love my s9+ for many reasons. Phones these days are so similar for the average user. If you just want something that works and don't want to spend 1000 to 1200 dollars on a phone, and if you've already spent money on apps from the Play Store, stick with Samsung. You can find an s9+ for about 600 dollars these days. That's about half what you'd pay for an equivalent model iPhone, and the differences aren't that much of a better value.",2019-01-02

2335,"An awesome reason why Samsung Pay is WAAAAAAYYY better than all other forms of mobile payments: Samsung works on 90% of credit card readers because they use NFC in conjunction with MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission), which they legally own and no other phone company can use. MST emits a magnetic signal that simulates the magnetic strip found on the back of a credit or debit card, which is why Samsung Pay is superior. All other phones only use NFC, which only work on the new credit card readers that have NFC readers installed. I love when I get to educate cashiers on this. Especially when they tell me ""We don't take Apple Pay"". Their reactions are the best when they realize how very wrong they were. I love Samsung Pay ❤",2019-01-05

2419,"I loved my s7 edge. It ended up becoming a bit laggy, but my real issue was with the fingerprint reader. My fingerprints are a bit less defined, through years of labor, I suppose, so the phone would often have trouble reading my prints. The screen was fantastic though, and the battery was stellar. 32GB of storage was way too small, in my opinion, and Samsung eventually pulled support for the ADB ability to merge the internal memory with an sd card, which meant that updates would cause apps to crawl back into internal memory and then needed to be moved back to the sd card. The camera on the s7 edge just seemed super fast and clear. Saying cheese to snap a photo was fun, too. I have an s9 plus now, and I miss the hardware buttons a lot, but the fingerprint reader is much better for me, and the 64GB internal storage is nice. I use an sd card for photos and such. The camera is better at low light pictures, but the s7 edge seemed faster at taking shots. I feel the s9 plus is the s7 edge with improvements all around, and compared with the iPhone 8 plus, it is much lighter. The 8 plus was my other option when looking at the s9 plus, at the time. I'm not a notch fan, and I like to customize the phone. I kept my s7 edge pristine, and I never developed burn or other display issues. Ah, I miss my s7 edge. Yeah, I sold it to buy the new phone. Should have kept it as a second or something.",2019-01-06

2465,"I'm much more concerned about the merchant having the actual card number than the walkby scenario. As I said, the main value in Samsung Pay is that the merchant gets an issuer token that can (and does) change whenever the issuer wants, and which cannot be used for CNP fraud instead of the PAN. I'm a PCI QSA (P2PE) and PA-QSA (P2PE), as well as a VISA PIN SA - I'm pretty well versed on payment card security :). As to phone fumbling, that's what a phone case is for - and I usually pay using my Galaxy S3 Frontier watch, which has Samsung Pay with MTS built-in.

I only use Amex cards in that scenario, as they are a) not NFC enabled, b) have no set credit limit and c) Amex is issuer, acquirer and network, and is generally better at noticing unusual activity. Plus, let's not forget that Samsung Pay let's me know everytime one of my registered cards is used anywhere, so I can take immediate action no matter where I am. I travel a lot internationally for work as well, it's a lot more reassuring to know that I don't have to worry about my PANs, PINs or actual cards getting stolen - and I've used Samsung Pay around the world. In fact, the only times it hasn't worked, those are the times that I pay in cash, since it is an indication that the system the merchant is using is doing something wrong, and probably wouldn't pass PA-DSS validation.

My tests only go as far as the XEU/BTU firmware which can be flashed if the phone is network unlocked. Where's your S8 originally from? Grab a Three PAYG sim, put it in and see if you get VoLTE calls.

I find this part doesn't make a whole lot of sense though (nothing against you, just their policy doesn't make sense if this is true): ""samsung cant assure condition of device and assure no damage transferred in the process"" Do you mean Samsung can't be assured? Because why would any damage occur just because the phone transferred from one person's hands to another? I mean they only cover manufacturer defects anyways (not a cracked screen or whatever), so who owns the phone is irrelevant. Or do you mean the person who buys it used can't be assured of the device's condition or any damage? Again, warranty only covers manufacturer defects in the warranty period, so why would it matter? Anyhow, how do they even know you are the original purchaser? Is it by receipt? So if you buy used and get the receipt from the seller, or give the phone as a gift with the receipt, wouldn't that be enough to claim warranty if needed? That's so strange that Samsung ""can't assure condition of the device"" while Apple doesn't care if you're the 10th owner, as long as it's under warranty they'll fix it.....

That being said iMessenger is the only thing i miss about iphone. and with good reason. when sending SMS the quality of images and videos are greatly reduced (if they even arrive at all.) long texts are split up and arrive out of order sometimes (if the entire message even gets there at all) and interactive features in SMS are basically non existant. I make up for this but using facebook messenger as my default sms program and try to never sms anyone using it. It took a year to get my old man on board with messaging me on facebook messenger rather than text.

Also be because Android was never really intended to have that hide the navbar feature, and Android's new gesture based navbar likely broke that implementation. Samsung did say they are working on it to bring it back in a future update according to the beta feedback report summary. Remember that Samsung is just overlaying things on Android. If Google changes something on Android fundamentally and a Samsung function is sitting on that base, then that Samsung function stops working. The navbar on Google never had that hide button IIRC. Samsung added that. Then Google straight up removed the navbar and replaced it with something different to accomodate gestures. This means the software underneath changed. It's not that easy to always retain legacy stuff, especially when the guys who make the base (Android) don't really seem to care about legacy stuff and expect people to keep up with them, and not bother to cater to those left behind.",2019-02-01

2925,Yeah and all of that is because of idiot people that can't wait 2years till under display tech is ready and will say that phone sucks if it's not totally different in design that previous 2 model .. They can make completely new software (which they did) improve camera and performance (which they did) but all you gonna hear is oh it's same as last one (like wotyh s6 and s7.. like with s8 and s9) and all that just because they look similar.. In reality in both examples model above was better in terms of specs and software .. And that's why samsung needs to make that stupid looking hole in display so idiots like people I just described not going to say oh it's the same as before and even tho s9 look waaaay better they gonna buy this one cuz well look different and everybody knows that it is the latest model.. It sucks that people like that actually dictate the market rather than people that actually have style and don't mind keeping similar design until something truly futuristic and new is ready.. Like I would totally buy s10 if it just had bigger battery better software and slightly smaller bezels than s9.. This way I'm just gonna wait for either note 10 or not fucking buy this crap until they actually release something new.. I'm currently on note 8 and I'm perfectly fine with it.. I might get n9 in few months tbh bc id does have better battery and smaller bezels and if they gonna fuck up note 10 like this chances of me getting n9 instead of 10 are 100% .. They should really think about what the fuck are they doing.. First they fucked up they smartwatch line up (like why would you ditch so futuristic design of gear s that nobody else had to go for classic looking watch that is around for fucking hundreds of year just WTF?) Lime sure try the circular one but keep that gear s around and give it new life after 2y or so.. Like imagine if they would make gear s today.. with full front side panel and button under the display like on note 9 boy I would buy that shit no matter the price... Idk what's going on but I don't like their design choises at all!,2019-02-02

2984,I'm still using my s8 plus and it's buttery smooth in the one ui beta. I'd recommend it because it's still getting one more year of updates and the price is right. Probably should wait for the s10 to release before getting any Samsung flagship tho.,2019-02-04

One UI has more of a stock Android feel to it, and is centered around one hand usability and seems more intuitive to use. All in all, the S9 is a fantastic phone across the board, and Samsung has the best screens in the biz, I'm sure it will be a great upgrade over your G5.",2019-02-04

Coming in 3 weeks. 2/ oneplus 6/6t. Go with 6 if you really want 3.5mm jack (op6 has big notch and small battery 6h on screen time). Go with 6t if you prefer water drop notch, incredible battery life (up to 10h screen time) and charging speed (30m - 50%) I prefer Oxygen OS over oneUI at the moment due to animation, smoothness, lock screen gestures (launch app or media control when you draw on lock screen).

Samsung used to be the go to android brand with their Galaxy line, but now they have competition with Google Pixel and OnePlus for top brands to compete against for top spot of Android, and then have to try to compete against Apple. Apple can charge ridiculous amounts of money because they are the only ones using that software and iOS. Samsung cant justify their price. They have 3 cameras on the back where the Pixel has 1 and still takes better pictures in every aspect. Samsung doesn't have the most powerful phone anymore either because of Pixel being stuck android and having no bloatware. All samsung has now is the best screen which is only a technical win considering when comparing to other lines a normal user wont be able to tell the difference between a samsung screen and an LG or Motorola screen.

You can't write off the fact that there's a huge market that actually likes Samsung software though. I personally go out of my way to use Samsung's apps, especially their Music Player, because a lot of my content is locally stored (shoutout to them for pushing the barriers of storage). It's a unique app experience that's well integrated with the very premium hardware they offer (Edge Display, Goodlock, One UI coloration, Adapt sound, Dolby Atmos).

It's not that big of a deal... I tried warning everyone on the s9 sub...

If the date said 20th feb i would have waited but saying its gonna come on the fourth and im here checking every few hours for it to come. They shouldnt make promises they cant keep.

Why did google do it again?) 8. Samsung phones are beautiful and everyone is catching up to them always have always will 9. I have the google camera app on my phone with functional night mode i can link it to you if u want(it works better on samsung cameras) 10.

3057,"Here's a list to contradict your list: 1) Samsung doesn't even like their own TouchWiz. They had to rebrand it to ""One UI"" AKA copying Google's Pixel Launcher. 2) Samsung isn't getting rid of the headphone jack mainly because they made a long term investment in AKG. If they remove the headphone jack it's most likely it'll take a hit. 3) AKG headphones included in the box are straight out garbage. FIRST THING I threw out in gladly paired my airpods which I have ZERO delay. 4) Fast charging is irrelevant when it comes to Google's Pixel since the battery lasts so much longer than Samsung devices. 5) Atmos was licensed most likely because Samsung still can't get sound right. Google doesn't need Atmos because they sound excellent . 6) Ram is irrelevant when the Operating system is optimized correctly. My Google Pixel 2 XL handled multitasking, heavy gaming and heavy ram based apps better than my Samsung S9 Plus. 7) Oddly enough the notch isn't as distracting as peopl claim it is. Either way Samsung is not releasing notch based devices copying Apple as well. 8) Samsung Devices are beautiful, but they break easily compared to others. Just ask search YouTube and you'll get your answer. 9) Samsung's camera is garbage compared to the either the Google Pixel 3's or even the Google Pixel 2's camera. Go a head, download a modes version of it ... Samsung cannot even get that right. 10) Amoled screens are over saturated and off colored. I cannot believe the color red looks ORANGE. 11) I was able to sell my Google Pixel 2 XL a few weeks ago for $700 CND one year after purchasing it. 12) 2 Year warranty. 13) Monthly Security updates. 14) Monthly Bug Fixes. 15) First to get the latest version of Android. 16) Guaranteed 3 years of Android Software upgrades. 17) As long as you own a pixel, Unlimited 24/7 support with a 1-1 agent either through call, text, or email (they can even take over your screen without installing 3rd party apps). You can always down vote the comment, but remember ... You stared this thread complaining. The only reason why I purchased a Samsung S9 plus was to lower my plan from $100 a month for 5G's of data to $65 for the exact same plan AND got a free S9 Plus put of it.

I said i like the phones because it has headphone jack. Whats soo contradicting in ur list? 3. Thats your opinion i think they work pretty good. 4. Just because u don't have something it becomes irrelevant anyways having it is a plus i dont get how u can justify not having it. Its like me cutting ur arm off and going like i did u a favor by getting u a prosthetic. 5. Again maybe u havent experienced it but atleast to me it sounds better than my friends iphones x and xr. If u say u have the s9+ go to youtube and watch this video called dolby atmos s9+ test watch it with the dolby mode on and then u can try it on a pixel you will see the difference. 6. I hope you are joking about this, maybe u havent seen the speed tests the pixel had the worst ram management last year. Every phone was better than it but hey for some reason to you having less ram is more appealing (its becoming a trend in your list: i dont have this but yea it doesnt matter, so mine is better?) 7. I dont buy budget phones and neither is the pixel a budget phone samsung introduced those in the budget category where it should stay. This just shows what samsung thinks about it. You can say its not distracting but its something in the way and there is no way it wont bother you while watching a video. And how much screen real estate do u loose if u dont crop to fit? 8. I use cases and really good quality screen protectors. All phones break the pixel will break so will a samsung so will an iphone. Its not like the pixel is special or built like a tank. But still i must add the oled on Samsung phones work even after dropping 10 times. You can watch the drop tests. Most phones dont survive 5. The designs are beautiful and that was my reason to buy it my phone should look the latest. I would have the oppo find x if it had the headphone jack. 9. Maybe you should go check out dxo mark scores samsung is always on top or atleast top 5. All those top 10 cameras are fantastic there is no such thing as a bad camera on a flagship phone today. all i said was i have the google camera app so i have the best of both worlds. Dont see anything wrong with that. 10. That problem with over saturation can be solved unlike the pixel u can actually change screen modes on samsung. There is adaptive which it comes with out of the box but u can change it to basic problem solved. 11. Thats good for you i live in the states its different here 12. In all my years of owning samsung phones ive never needed the warranty the phones are built really well. But yea i agree on that, peace of mind is good and i would like that with samsung too didnt know they had that. 13. Mine gets those too every other month havent seen any changes to it. But they did add some features like the video wallpaper and slow motion to the s8. But monthly updates is why i started this thread and i agree thats something Samsung lacks. But i can tell you something u will never get ur headphone jack back through an update but samsung can add all those features through different softwares and stuff. 14,15,16. Good points and that is why i started this thread samsungs lack of software updates and its a problem they need to fix. I have to add all these answers apply differently to different people maybe u like bluetooth headphones thats your choice, maybe i like my screen over saturated and you dont. There are somethings that u can get with different apps and softwares and then there are somethings u cant get like headphone jack and lack of a notch but again like i said u might be able to accept a phone with a notch, i cant. When i wanna spend 800$+ on a phone i do alot of research those were my reasons to buy samsung because thats what appealed to me.",2019-02-05

3115,"God, that's a tough one lol. I love(d) the pixel software until Pie, it really went to shit after that, so take that as my bias. It's literally an upgrade to everything. A proper upgrade, compared to the Pixel 3 XL. Geez, I guess I miss call screening when I briefly had it. Never really looked back though because the note is literally an upgrade to everything. The software is a bit overwhelming going from minimalist to max. embrace it though, it's an enjoyable experience if you desire to upgrade. Sorry if that's a bit vague. Here's if I were to directly compare my note 9 to the OGXL. Camera: I miss the simplicity of a point and shoot, no stupidity kinda deal with the Pixel. The note 9 though, is so much more modern. 4k60 is nuts, OIS &gt; EIS, portrait mode, etc. It's like it's from this century with features that are great. Pictures also instantly process. I know sometimes the XL can be stupid and take forever- yeah no that doesn't happen on the Note these days. Battery: EASILY, the Note or S9. The battery kinda went to shit on the XL for me, but charged so much faster than the Note. I will honestly give it that. If I went to take a shower with the XL dead, it'd be at like 60% when I was done. Note on the other hand, more like 25-30. However, the Note can get me up to 8hrs SOT with 20 hours use, and over a day and a half if I don't abuse it. Not even a joke. My XL I'd only get 3-4. Not even a joke, like you'll see these typical battery pushers who leave the screen on all day, getting 6 on the pixel and whatever on the note, yeah no I'm talking practically here. The charge is worth the extra battery. Build: No questions here, the Note 9 absolutely destroys the pixel in terms of build. When I first used the Note, it actually blew me away with the screen size, and how more uniform and solid it feels. Not much to say, hold the phone and you'll understand why. Also you can use your phone in the rain so that's a bonus and wirelessly charge it, but that's basic knowledge. Software: If you're worried about the horror stories of past where OEM skins literally destroyed Android, well I can say the specs caught up, and the note is lag free for the most part. Trust me, I came from an LG G4 before the XL. That phone was a disaster in terms of software and hardware. Obviously updates are going to take an eternity. One UI is trimmed, and a lot less disgusting than what tw was. People like Samsung for a reason. I hope this helps! If there's any small questions you have, ask away.",2019-02-07

3189,In EU Samsung has a 3 year warranty (2 years from the store and 1 year from Samsung itself) Still it looks like a panel switch which might be pretty expensive since it's most of the TV. Though do contact support and if it doesn't work out you can ask a repair company (a new TV might be cheaper at that point).,2019-02-09

Let everything work with Google Drive (instead of Samsung Cloud), for example, just like iCloud. And implement Google Duo on every Android phone, like FaceTime. And implement Google Messages on every phone like iMessage. I could go on and on about this but I think you get what I'm trying to say. This would make it much easier to switch from iOS to Android.",2019-02-28
3197,He mentions scrolling. Is it really that different on a Samsung compared to an iPhone?,2019-02-28
3198,"A - Correct. That is why they offer them on the website. B - It depends.. The phone would need to be carrier unlocked. Since you're buying it from Samsung, I'm not sure if they sell them unlocked, or if you would request an unlock code from them, or if you would need to get one from your carrier, or if new phones even come carrier locked anymore.. Also, with the S9 or S9+, you could flash different carrier roms to the phone using Samsung's Odin software, since the hardware for an S9 on sprint was the same as an S9 on At&amp;t. So I could take my Verizon branded phone, flash At&amp;t's firmware to it, and it wouldn't be any different than if I had purchased an At&amp;t phone, other than having Verizon's name physically printed on the device. However, not all phones have identical hardware and the modem chip in those phones can only work with certain frequency bands. Meaning that a phone that may work on GSM wouldn't work on CDMA, or vice-versa. I believe all Qualcomm chips are physically capable of working on all bands, since it's only the firmware that governs the functionality, but I don't know if all the same rules apply to the S10. I read that somsung added some security that blocks Odin now. Only time will tell if the community gets around it, and if the system images are interchangeable still. As well as which devices, if any, are carrier locked and who unlocks them. Most carriers require you use the device on their network for a period of time before they allow you to unlock it. But again, I have no idea how it all works when purchasing through samsung, or with the S10",2019-02-28

I do agree with some of your points that having 2 cloud services is pointless, but Samsung cloud can do things that Google drive doesn't. As far as I'm aware, duo is the only video service so that's good.

3207,"Right... But then they run the risk of an iterative release from a competitor outdoing them one year and losing a lot of sales. Samsung wants to have that ecosystem experience just like Apple's, so that people stick to Samsung because of all the great features they can't live without. If they let Google handle all of that, then their customers are just going to keep looking for the best Android phone. With the way Google is already creating an ecosystem of Pixel features that nobody else gets to experience (at least not yet), Samsung's really gotta either stay way ahead on hardware or build software features that keep users from wanting to switch.",2019-02-28

I used them again this week on my Note 8. I dropped and broke my screen they sent me a refurbished phone. Looks brand new though. Very easy but cost $249. Samsung care would have been $99. I also have a CC with phone insurance so I claimed that $249 with them so hopefully I will only be out $25. I just ordered the Samsung S10 plus, since they are the same insurance I will just go with Samsung for the lower deductible plus lower monthly amount.

It couldn't be more true. All the customization is fairly simple to learn with a few youtube videos, the exception in a way is Tasker. Tasker is basically phone automation. For example, I set mine us so if my phone is vertical (In my car vent holder), plugged in to charge(Always plug my phone in in my car), has an audio cable connected(AUX cable in my car), and the phones GPS detects speeds greater than XYmph then I launch a weblink that opens spotify on my phone and plays Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins. I couldn't even dream of this amount of customization on IOS, you can't even put your apps where you want. I was huge into IOS around IOS 8-9, watching every rumor and every video. But I switched and after about a week of difficulty it became smoother than IOS ever was. You may be deep into the ecosystem, but you can run a lot of stuff on android, even apple music.

Notice Samsung phones are notorious for lag and battery problems after two years exactly. Samsung has an extensive history for shady business practices.

Samsungs OneUI is not even a skin. Its a whole new framework. This stuff needs so much time to develop and it wont help that samsung is releasing a shitton of phones every year. &amp;#x200B; As for the 2 year update plan I somehow have the feeling that Samsung is getting Android Q to the S8.

3341,"To answer your question, it would be worth it. The Exynos processor is only slightly less powerful than the Snapdragon 855. However, Samsung has really stepped it up with One UI. The integration will most likely be better with Exynos seeing as it's their chipset. I also have the Pixel 2XL and I was in the same boat. However, there are two things that made me pull the trigger. For one Samsung's hardware is top of the line. And even after holding the S10e in my hand I looked at my Pixel 2XL in a different way, it feels cheapish (could just be me). The other thing is that you can tell Samsung is actually trying again. This lineup is not some little upgrade from last year, it's huge. It's actually innovative and that makes me excited about Samsung again. As for the camera, I have been seeing shots on Instagram that people are taking and they look pretty damn good.

It is annoying at night that the brightness has to be full blast when it scans because it's an optical scanner, but I've to come to accept this quirk. Performance is great, plenty of RAM and internal storage is enough for me. Camera gets the job done. UI is my favorite out of any Android phone.

Frankly it depends on what you use it for, but if all you do is want messaging from your computer you can switch from SMS to WhatsApp if that's what you would like to do. If you want to retain communicating via SMS then Pushbullet or Samsung Flow may be the best option. Again, in my opinion Flow is horrendous at a seamless transition from phone to PC as you need Bluetooth on for it to work. To clarify: I do not have a Pushbullet pro subscription.

Samsung loves to make photos 'pop' by exaggerating certain colours (making the sea/sky look more blue than green etc.).

Not only that: you can also use external microphones or headphones with your jack while you can charge your phone! And its true. The comapnies remove the jack to sell their 5000$ wireless buds.

I need to be able to plug my phone in charge it and use my headphones while my device is in my pocket. A true wireless solution just doesn't fit my professional needs. You can get adapters and dongles... i just want to plug my headphones in work and if my phone is dying charge it at the same time. Simple, easy and out of the box with several extra cords and devices. Samsung it just does it, no mess no fuss. Please keep the headphone Jack. Maybe one day when we have solid state batteries that last 4 and 5 days on a charge I won't care anymore. But till that future is a reality.",2019-03-02

I say all that to say this: Don't settle for these lame azz deals through your carrier or reorder the phone, Samsung is aware of this issue by now and they basically have been making notes of every account and sending it to tech as these cancellations were made without purpose and is some widespread error, and Samsung is assuring me that I will get my order this Friday. &amp;#x200B; When I purchased, I read all of the Terms and Conditions, it never said Samsung had to right to cancel orders without specific purpose.

That being said...I switched from Apple to Android about a year ago and haven't looked back. Once you push through that awkward phase it is SOOO worth it. I thought customizability was something I wasn't going to use because I didn't care about different fonts or icon styles. But it is SOOO much more than that. I am really happy that I can do what I want with my phone. Plus, (personal opinion) I like to be on the cutting edge of technology and I feel that Samsung is really trying to give that to the consumer. There are bugs and hiccups along the way, and sometimes I have felt like throwing my phone against the wall...but overall I don't know if I could go back to iOS. At least right now.",2019-03-31

3675,"I've just (last week) switched from an XS Max to an S10+. I also got Samsung Buds (my airpods batteries were shot anyway) and a Samsung Watch Active (I had the AW Series 4). So far I'm pretty happy. I have the Sennheiser TW buds and they sound better and connect better with Samsung's BT 5 than they ever did with the iPhone. I was having BT connection issues since the last iOS update. I was also having Pocket Casts and Audible randomly closing on me, so my overall experience with the S10+ is better. It is lighter in weight, the screens are about the same, the under screen fingerprint sensor is not as good as face unlock but Android has lots of options to keep the phone unlocked when in range of the watch, BT headphones etc. I have always used Google services a lot which probably helps the transition. I don't use Snapchat. The customisation options in Android are amazing coming from an iPhone. The camera's are about the same level. Overall I'm happy and won't be switching back any time soon.",2019-03-31

There are always one or two people like you that swears to Samsung phones lagging after a brief usage while everyone else is talking about the nonexistent lag even after years of usage. If you're having issues on S9 others aren't having, what makes you think you won't have the same issues using the iPhones? That is, if you're not just fabricating the whole story and actually telling the truth.",2019-03-31
3678,"You're talking about the face unlock? Wow. Way to take that one flaw and blow it out of proportion. S10 offers so many ways to unlock the phone, so the flaw in face unlock is not detrimental to the unlocking security. If S10 was like the iPhones and was stripped of all other unlocking security features such as fingerprint sensor, then I'd take your comment more seriously. No one will use the face unlock in favor of the fingerprint sensor, anyways. Also, when you are just generally talking about the security on S10 being poor, you should be talking about the overall security of the phone. Unfortunately for you, Samsung phones with Knox are more secure than iPhones and other Android devices. &amp;#x200B;",2019-03-31

I didn't come from an iPhone but instead a moto z play which was really on its last leg. I was hesitant to get my first Samsung phone in seven years but the UI is smooth and yeah it's got some bloatware but thus far I haven't noticed any issues. I was lucky to get mine brand new for only 650 from Costco as they were running a special for tmobile customers. The hardware is great and it's incredibly well designed and built. This device just works and it works flawlessly. Again the camera is phenomenal...the live focus feature is easy and great. Battery so far seems great as well...probably about 6 hours screen time.

3687,"I switched from an X and AW4 to S10+ and Galaxy Watch a bit over a week ago. No regrets at all so far. Been with Apple since the 3G, with a few visits to Android, but never stayed more than a few months, because I couldn't help myself when something new came along. Now I have a mortgage and other debts I can't afford to chop and change phones every 6 months anymore. The leaks for what the next iPhone will look like have put me off wanting one too, so there shouldn't be any temptation to go back this year either. Things are a lot better now with the software so I'm going to stick it out. App quality has improved too in recent years from what I've seen. Bit of a learning curve with all the extra things you can do with the phone settings, but worth the time to get the hang of it. The finger print scanner works about 98% of the time for me. Still waiting on the latest firmware update that apparently improves things. when it works I'd say it's on par with Face ID for unlock speed, maybe slightly behind, but you're not going to notice unless you're doing side by side comparisons. Still using my airpods and they work great, but I will be getting a set of the Samsung buds sometime soon. I used keychain for my passwords, and luckily I still have an iPad, and MacBook Pro, so I can access my passwords if I can't remember any. Just have to find the best option for saving them with this phone (Samsung, Google, or 3rd party). I'm now waiting for my telco to get the S10 5G so I can get my free upgrade. I'll miss the nice look of the ceramic black, seeing as silver and gold are the only two options that will be available here.

Im convinced the majority of these people are either imagining they are being slighted when they aren’t or are just making this shit up. Only other possibility is they are sending out some kind of powerful weird inferiority complex vibe that is so strong it makes people look down on them for using non-Apple products.

3779,"Okay, I had to double check and correct myself, but it seems as though the firmware version was a G950US version. It was released in March 2018. I flashed that firmware. My hope was to flash a firmware version that would work and not lock the boot loader. When it flashed correctly I was surprised. There was an exploit that lets you get to the contacts app from the emergency services during the wizard set up. I managed to use that method (without a sim card some how) and get to the contacts app. From there you can send messages (or try to) and send links to apps. If you go to a YouTube link it will open the YouTube app. Surprisingly in the terms and services section of the YouTube app you will open the terms in a web browser. If you have access to the web browser you have access to APK files. By default my firmware was only opening the Samsung Internet app. However luckily Firefox has an APK. Installing the Firefox APK gave me access to changing my default browser to none other than the Google Chrome browser from there I downloaded a third party apk app that was designed to give you the option to access any app on the phone without being on the Galaxy's main UI. So I went to the settings app cleared and turned off cloud storage syncing to the original account which no one including my buddy even knew about. I disabled Google Play services and added a brand new Google account and rebooted this made the install wizard just push on through thinking the new Google account was the admin account. Some issues I ran into: in order to access emergency calling you need a connection to towers unless that direct emergency call is to 911. Which I didn't want to make our 911 services freak out so I called and told them it was a test call and it was. Problem I had was that the phones sim tray was non existent. So a buddy lended me his tray and I used my personal Verizon sim. This actually caused my account to be locked as the device's IMEI was black listed. So I had to go to Verizon and have my account fixed. So this created the issue of ""if I try to do this again I can't use my personal sim so how will I access emergency services again? For some odd reason the phone let me do so without a SIM card. Here is where things get odd. Without the firmware version I got the phone actually would crash the wizard install app constantly. I got a tad discouraged thinking this meant that the phones current firmware version was designed to patch the exploit. So u actually reset the phone and for some reason it knew the Google account I added was there and the wizard install app decided to push on through to the ""add a Gmail account portion."" The next issue I had was it would read the Gmail but it wouldn't actually go anywhere. Instead it would say ""adding an account"" but just loop back around to add the account again. So once more I found myself stuck. That is when I decided to try all over again but this time with the older firmware version and entirely knew Gmail account. After a reboot and some hassle it just worked after reboot. Went on through no loops no crashing it just worked.",2019-04-01

I asked to clarify the timeline and was told I should expect to hear back from them via email within 4 business days. Not a great experience so far, but hopefully I will hear back from them soon and will receive the $130 credit soon as well. I was thinking about using the credit to just buy a couple of wireless chargers instead of the buds. Anyone agree / disagree with this decision? It was a little unclear to me as to whether the $130 credit could be used to purchase multiple items or just a single item.

Last I heard, Huawei has no choice but to buy Samsung's foldable screens (due to BOE's incapability to produce foldable OLED screens at a volume relevant enough) despite all the childish jabs they've taken at Samsung. BOE's screen technology (LCD and OLED) came from a Korean company that apparently went bankrupt. Aside from that, Chinese giant corporations are continuously poaching hundreds if not thousands of Korean engineers to help them catch up to the Korean standards when it comes to screens and semi-conductors. Unfortunately, you can only copy and mimic so much and you will never be able to surpass the original creators no matter how many billions of dollars you waste.

If you don't believe me, take a look at the cost of a new [iPhone 6s]( compared to a [Galaxy S6]( that came out the same year. Both came out in 2015. iPhone is $529 and the S6 is $307. New.

Doesn't matter if you wish to only have full hd . And they say that the vibration motor on the one plus is a pain in the ass . For me . Privacy and what Samsung gives me are far more important than what oneplus gives you . Always go with the big dogs. Also the notch might make your experience unpleasant .

Given that, let's try to summarize: Samsung (the producer) is selling a charger with 2 pads. both pads are compatible with qi device but only one is compatible with the watch. We asked ourselves if the reason could be the coils' size, but it is not since: quoting you """" there are multiple coils in the larger pad. They overlap which in turn helps the smaller coil get a connection. """" So, why is Samsung (the producer again) asking us not to recharge the watch on this pad? maybe because it is not compatible or not fully compatible with the charge qi standard?

It served me great over all these years, but started to slow down and glitch out around two years ago. I could've probably fixed most of the problems by doing a factory reset and cleaning it up file wise, but I was getting tired of applications I wanted to use not supporting Android 4.0. The final straw was when my banking app stopped supporting 4.0. So it was time for an upgrade!

3904,"I'll try to explain it better: If you look at the watch charger it will say it outputs 5V which is the voltage needed for ""standard"" wireless charge like Samsung calls it. Qi chargers can output 5W @5V 9W @9V 15W @12V. Now, if you put a galaxy phone on the qi charger and manually disable the fast wireless charge it will negotiate the 5V profile with the charger. If you leave fast charge enable it will negotiate the 9V profile with the charger. If you put the watch on the qi charger it will start charging with the 9V profile WHICH IS NOT THE RIGHT PROFILE. So, I'm afraid the watch cannot negotiate the right qi profile when put on a generic qi charger, thus requiring a precise charger. You can post all the coil images you want but the watch works flawlessly on bigger coil, it simply can't negotiate the right charging profile from what I see. I seriously hope I made it clear.

3930,"tl;dr: Why am I not getting audio from my 4k upscaling Blu-ray player? Yesterday I received a refurbished Samsung BD-JM63 Blu-ray player with 4K upscaling. I plugged it into my TV (a Samsung NU6900 55"" UHD TV) with an old HDMI cable that I dug out of a box in the garage, and went through the player's setup (which included a firmware update). At no point could I get any sound from the player -- I attempted playing several Blu-rays and a couple of DVDs, and while I could see the image just fine, there was no audio. Tried a CD too, and never heard anything. I fiddled with the player's audio settings (PCM vs. bitstream, etc.), but no sound. Tried the TV's HDMI 1 and HDMI 2 ports, power-cycled everything more than once, ran a factory reset on the player -- no dice. I plugged the player into a cheapo Element HDTV and had the same issue. I have not tried the player's optical out yet, mostly because I'd prefer not to use it (and because I don't have an optical cable sitting around at the moment). More importantly, I'm almost certain that I'm using a 10-year-old HDMI cable, and I'm almost positive that I don't have a newer high-speed / premium / 2.x HDMI cable handy. I'm wondering whether this could be the issue -- that older cables just won't work with this model, even when attempting to play something as low-bandwidth as a DVD or CD.

For those that are bigger than 16:9, Samsung artificially caps the video/game to stop right below the hole punch so it is literally never in the way and it's also no different than the top bar of the phone being a bezel.

Plus they didn't do any promotions like what Samsung does where you can get the newest flagship for hundreds less than msrp right on release. It should've been priced $100 to $200 less. People who mention the pixel always talk about the camera, besides that, there wasn't anything groundbreaking or special. Personally, the One Plus phones are doing what Google should be doing, or what Nexus used to do.

The 9 models didn't support it at their respective launches. That might have something to do with.

I used to work retail electronics and if I had to imagine your typical old person coming looking for a nice phone I would recommend the s10e all day long without a doubt.

4088,"I jumped from a iPhone XS to the S10. I'm a fan of new tech just like you and do it periodically. Ive never been a fan of the Pixel phones regardless of the clean Android experience because the hardware feels like poor quality. I usually jumped ship back to iOS because the phone either slowed down or app crashes. However this time I have been very pleased at the state of Android. Regarding security, I do not think you need a virus blocker or anything. The Samsung internet app is better than Chrome imo because it allows for you to add an adblocker which solves a lot of ad issues. Still not as good as Safari on iOS but much better than anything else on Android. Also the OS security on Android has gotten much better. Steve Gibson on Security Now just did a podcast where he came away very impressed with the latest security updates by Google. As for iMessages, there is obviously no clear alternative. I've heard that you can use the Google messages app on both phones and computer but I haven't used it. Apple Music is lot better on Android now. It was unusable in previous versions.

There's also AirDroid, which accomplishes the same thing. Also, the Samsung ecosystem is pretty cool.

4103,"This is not actually the case, I wasn't buying ti because I was loyal, I bought it because I trusted them to be out for the customer. &amp;#x200B; Telling me its ok to build weak flimsy devices because its the customer's fault if it breaks is not ok. Case in point, the cracked screen is not entirely my fault, as it is a device made ridiculously -long- so as to not fit in any standard pocket and it can not be protected by most protectors as it has a rounded screen for no particular reason other than to ""hide"" the phone edges from most viewers who think 1-2mm of Bezel is somehow bad. Its a trick to make you think there is no bezel when there is, its just that the glass is rounded there to make you see a screen still only now you can accidentally click buttons while simply trying to hold your phone. &amp;#x200B; Accidents happen, Areyes. My S3 was my first device, and often I only had service when it was in one specific spot in the room and only there. I had to keep it in that one exact spot on top of the mini fridge to get signal at all out here and no there is no other service that would have worked out here at that time. It often got knocked down by the cat or even that time there was a minor earth quake shook the house just enough to knock it down. I used to be weaker than I am now due to health problems, had a weak grasp on things and sometimes the phone would slip. A time when I was out on my bike going through grass, I hit a bump and the strap broke throwing the phone to the ground. These are just examples of the accidents that happened to my S3 and it survived with NO DAMAGE because Samsung made a great device and I loved them for it. I was so happy with it I stuck with Samsung to get my next device. &amp;#x200B; On top of that the other potential devices cost hundreds more and weren't unlocked or compatible with the service I wanted to get. I found that I was able to get a discount on the S8 I was looking at, and could unlock it after a short time. When I got the device, I was a little disappointed because of how long it was, and the round screen edges, but at the time I didn't think they were terrible things. I bought a phone case for it, and found out that there are no reliable screen protectors for the device because of how the screen is designed, it is unprotectable to the primary way in which screens get cracked due to its round edge and 90% of screens were incompatible with the decent double layer cases. &amp;#x200B; It was only later on, months later, when I discovered that the battery can not be easily swapped. As if the phone was designed with a self destruct timer inside it because batteries are always the weakest component and are guaranteed to die within a year or two. Case in point, my battery has now expanded with enough force to push both the back panel off slightly, and make the screen of the phone dent forward in one spot. Now I must take the phone in to have a dangerous procedure done to repair it because Samsung has declared that I can't just walk in to a battery shop, pop the back off, plop the battery down on the table and say ""Hey, I need a new one of these"". A simple procedure for my old phone, you save no space GLUING the battery in, you don't get any added capacity, you don't protect the user any more with a GLUED IN BATTERY. There's no reason of any kind to GLUE a battery in. The fact that they glued the case on was enough to ensure the battery stays inside, and even then the internals show another support piece inside that also holds the battery in place. Why does Samsung feel the need to GLUE a battery in so that it can only be removed by exposing it to a dangerous situation like heating it up? Do they feel they need to make battery replacement so dangerous that it can kill people so as to prevent anyone from replacing their battery? Is it their goal to cause severe injury to anyone who tries to fix their own device? Whats the point of gluing a battery into a sealed device that already contains extra supports of its own for holding a battery inside a sealed confined space? The only reason I can think of, is what I listed above. To make battery replacement a dangerous complicated process that can severely injure people and destroy a device if you are unlucky or if you aren't a professional. &amp;#x200B; Furthermore, is it still my fault I had health issues causing me to be unable to hold onto my phone perfectly? As you said, I should treat my devices better. You assume that accidents don't happen with that statement. You also forgot to think maybe there is a reason other than negligence that I could have been dropping the device a lot. You just came at me as if its my fault for being careless. &amp;#x200B; Is Samsung -really- giving people what they want when everyone just goes out and buys a phone protector? Why do they think people want something, and then see everyone go out and undo the things they were given? E.G. Thinner phones are negated by phone protectors. Tool kits are released to help people replace irreplaceable batteries and open up these sealed devices that are ridiculously designed so as to ensure no one can repair it. Replacement batteries are STILL a thing even with the new irreplaceable batteries. Is Samsung going to start banning people who talk about device repair like Apple did to that professional who repairs Apple devices and recovers the data that Apple proclaimed to be impossible to recover? I don't think Samsung would be so petty as to do that, with everything being on record on the internet, and users like me who often screenshot everything and back up website posts on ""the wayback machine"" to prevent censorship. I doubt Samsung would start doing that, but I don't know, I've started losing my faith in them.",2019-04-06

The help technician double-checked with me regarding the capability of changing display modes for home screens, app screens, and I confirmed I could do it with the previous phone.

After 9 emails and 7 calls (total of an hour and a half on the phone), I finally got an email today (not too long after another 21 minute) telling me that my refund was on the way. Overall I'm still out a bit of money - about $24 from keeping my protection plan on the old phone for two whole months just in case, and another $30 because a phone payment went through and the upgrade program only covers what was still owed on the previous device =/ &amp;#x200B; I am super done dealing with it so I guess Samsung can keep that money. I will probably do the upgrade program again, but next time I'm not picking the fancy version of the phone - that way I can trade it in to someone more reliable for the next go around (I'm sure the ceramic s10 won't have extra trade in value.) I guess I could also sell it used, but doing phone sales myself, I've seen too many used phone sales go bad to risk it. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for hangin' in with me there. If you ever trade in a device to Samsung yourself, make sure you take lots of pictures - maybe even video of yourself putting the device in the box. Or, as I recommend, trade it in to someone else.

4253,Saldy i dont own one. I have a older Samsung TV. (5 years old). But i used to sell TVs. The AF9 is incredible. Probably the best processor that a TV can have. The X1 Ultimate. Plus Sony has QLED since a long time tbh. It is called Triluminus. It has the same purpose as a qled but works a little bit diffrent. Qled is just a smart marketing technique.

They told me to use 5G for all of my streaming. I've been using an older smart TV with limited capabilities so I just use a Chromecast for all of my streaming. Got it set up, used it for a few days with no issues whatsoever, but my TV suddenly died. It was a Vizio something or other that I traded an ex for when he moved out. • Anyway, now I need a new TV and I would like a nice smart TV with apps built in so I don't have to juggle apps on my phone and Chromecast all the time. BUT, I've noticed some popular smart TVs aren't 5G compatible (nearly bought a Samsung but noticed the complaints online). How do I know if a TV is 5G compatible? It doesn't say in the specs on Best Buy or Walmart's websites. Googling just brings up complaints from people trying to connect who are realizing the TV they just bought isn't compatible. • My second question is if I got one of these Samsung TVs that isn't compatible with 5G, can I just use a Chromecast and have the Chromecast and my phone connected to the 5G and not my TV? I'm assuming that my old smart TV wasn't 5G compatible but I never connected the TV to the internet, just the Chromecast. But could that be what killed it?

I can't say much about that since ""lag"" in general is very subjective. &gt;You must think I have a lot of time on my hands. For all I know, the problems might have even disappeared because I reset it when i sold it Hmm. So, because you don't have time on your hand, you couldn't even reset the phone to check if it would fix the problems. You instead took pictures and put up your Note 9 for sale on some website, went out to buy a new phone, and either shipped the Note 9 to the buyer or met the buyer in person in a public location to do a cash transaction, all while still having to reset the phone for the sale? And the phone you decided to get is another Android while you're here boasting about the great OS iPhones have? Anyways, let me help you understand something. Whatever happened to your Note 9 is called a defect. Defects happen, which is why Samsung has manufacturer's warranty. No matter how much you prefer the iPhone's OS, they are also prone to defects, which is why Apple has manufacturer's warranty. If I get an iPhone with unusual problems that 99.99999% of the iPhone users don't experience but use these problems to say a statement like ""This is why iPhone's OS is inferior to Android,"" I would probably become the laughingstock.

4349,"Four features ios has that Android doesn't: Facetime, iMessage, live Camera, and a working face id. After I switched to Samsung there was nothing at all that I missed. With Android pie and Samsung One, Android has a much more premium feel to it. I have to admit I was not a big fan of Lolipop. Transfering data from your phone will be easy as Samsungs ship with a wire that you just connect and it all transfers within an hour. You can also transfer things to or from your Android just by dragging them from your PC. That is literally the biggest thing that made me switch and I love it. Samsungs also have multi tasking, so you can have two apps on your screen at a time. You can watch Youtube in the background and it even works with some music video.(Not with all) You don't need all of your apps on the home screen. a lot nicer than Siri, even if it's ui isn't as nice imo. You can also put widgets on the home screen, (I sort of miss the ios widget page) or make blank home screens to enjoy your wallpaper. File management is a dream, just make new folders and drag files around with your PC. You have a standard USB-C charger that lasts longer. The phones are all much better value. (AAt least with the S Series, idk about Note) The 128 gb Samsung is 50 dollars cheaper than the iPhone XR and has a better screen, the 512GB S10 is 200 dollars cheaper than the 256GB XS, and the 512gb S10+ is 300 dollars cheaper than the XS Max. &amp;#x200B; There are some downsides to Samsung and Android. From what I hear Samsung is terribly slow with updates. The RAM management is shit. My phone has 6gbs and just sitting at the home screen takes up half of it. When you have several apps open in the background it really really really shows. That's all I have really noticed. I might find out more as time goes on.",2019-05-04

The switch was painless and soon had my apps all set up and I was back to having a phone setup as I wanted in a few days. Now the question of the ecosystem, it’s the one that usually pulls you back unless you are set in your mind you want to change and not just want to play with a new shiney toy. The usual problem is moving to an android phone and then wanting to be set up and work as an iPhone, you want it to integrate with all your other apple products and in essence want nothing to change. If that’s your approach, save your money and stay with Apple. If however you are going to embrace the Chang, be willing to change daily workflows and usage. Make the new device work for you rather than trying to making it work like an Apple product ... then you will make the switch and soon discover a device more than capable of doing all you thought you needed and much more. I am really enjoying the S10+ and can honestly say I haven’t regretted the move. The camera is excellent, but word of advice don’t keep comparing to iPhone pictures as they both process images in a different way so you will be continually finding differences. Learn to use the new camera and enjoy using it to capture great images.

4487,"1. Samsung has it's own in built remapping service. I have the Bixby button set to open up my bus and train times. It works flawlessly. 2. Bixby is completely unobtrusive across my device. I don't use it at all and its never once been opened accidentally, it doesn't push notifications to me, I don't have the panel to the left of the home screen turned on. 3. Bixby isn't designed to replace anything. Google voice assistant has it's own hardware button on the phones, holding in the pressure sensitive home button engages it. What it's designed to do is operate within the bounds of the Samsung ecosystem, using Samsung's well established smart devices, such as refrigerators, dishwashers, washing machines, TVs, stereos, etc. 4. The app suite isn't a copy of anything. Its an alternative to Google services. Personally, I don't use many of them, however I do use the calendar, notes, email, and internet. I do this for the simple reason of, I can set up adblockers, I avoid using Google services as much as possible to preserve my online privacy. 5. The use case for the sort of things you're describing is very narrow and specific. People will buy a case with an air quality sensor due to, as a simplification, 2 reasons: they have a reason to doubt their air quality and it's a cheap/convenient method of doing so. This is great, and it's a clever implementation of tech. A purpose built sensor with purpose built software is going to be cheaper to develop than as a feature on an already expensive device. Samsung's flagships use the best screens, processors, and other parts available. This eats into development budget. 6. With several billion dollars behind you, you could make a feature-rich phone that I have no doubt would be a great device to use, if you had any intelligence. However, could you market it, produce it and make a profit on it while listening to investors and directors and management? I doubt it. Risk-taking in technology has become less mainstream due to the dropping in profits over the last year or so in the smartphone market, particularly in the premium ranges. This isn't Samsung specific. 7. Yep, note phones are the best in the world for productivity, nothing like them, nothing as well implemented as them. 8. You can uninstall it. You can wipe your entire device and install a custom ROM. Nobody is stopping you.

4492,"Hello everyone, Note 9 user here having extremely frustrating Bluetooth issues, specifically audio quality. I've tried around 6 different Bluetooth earbud sets, ranging from cheap Amazon brands to beatsx. Everything seems to connect and use a shitty codec, usually SBC but one or two use AAC and still have garbled sound. doesn't seem to matter what the advertised codec or Bluetooth revision is. This is backed up by the fact that I can't change the codec in the developer options, and by the fact that when I pair these same devices to my old iPhone 5s, the sound quality is fine, no garbling, no disconnects, volume is fine etc. this goes for all tested devices except one of the cheap Amazon brands which sounded bad on both devices, and the beatsx which sound good on both but are a much older model and don't work in other ways. (disconnects, resetting pairing, doesn't hold a charge etc.) I use Bluetooth earbuds every day at work and frequently in my non work life, and I've had this note 9 for about 6 months now and I'm starting to question if I should keep it. I ordered some new Galaxy buds that will be here sometime this week, if those work and sound good and I'm happy then I may stick with them and the note. just curious if anyone has any insight on this because it severely limits the value of this expensive phone for me. curious if it's a Samsung thing, a note 9 thing, an android thing, or what. because I have considered a pixel phone and I even entertain switching back to whatever iPhone they come out with this year.

If it wasn't for the poor battery life(the buds themselves have 6 hours, but the case only has one full charge), and the clunky case(compared to the Airpoda case, which also has about triple the battery life of the Galaxy Buds case) this is an amazing product, and I would pay full price and be satisfied.

There is a glare on the curves, but imo it actually looks nice. When using the phone, they way that things kind of flow off of the screen when you swipe gives it a really unique and interesting look. When watching Fullscreen video, you can see a slight difference in color from the main screen and the curves (just because of how OLED looks from an angle), but I don't think it impacts the viewing experience at all. If anything it makes it look a little better to me. The curved screen also adds an interesting functionality; the edge screen. This means you can swipe from the very edge if the screen and bring up a panel of apps (that you choose), quick actions, your music, the weather, calendar, etc. This works on a flat screen, but I think with a case on a flat screen phone it's very difficult to access. I didn't think it was going to be something if actually use, but I put my most used apps there, and now I use it all the time. People also talk about accidental touches. I use a very thin clear case, and I have only accidentally touched the edge 5 times at most since I've had the phone. If you have a case, you most likely won't have accidental touches, and if you do, there's an app in Goodlock (goodlock is a group of Samsung apps for extra customization) that can add dead zones to the edges so you don't accidentally touch the edges. The curved screen also works great with a screen protector. Plastic and glass both work fine, the biggest difference is that the glass needs to have a LOCA application in order to work with the fingerprint sensor underneath the screen. I've applied two Whitestone dome screen protectors to my S10+, and it looks and works great, and doesn't hinder my fingerprint sensor at all. Speaking of the fingerprint sensor, I know some people are going to say that the sensor under the glass is bad and/or doesn't work well. That's mostly not true. A lot of people never had any issues with it in the first place, and for people who did have issues with it, it got a few updates and now works even better, even with screen protectors.",2019-05-09

4540,There is a security setting where your phone will factory reset if the incorrect password is entered a few times (I think 5). Perhaps you were holding your phone and accidentally entering a password and that triggered a factory reset? The other possibility is that someone who has access to your google or samsung account wiped the phone remotely. No one hacked your phone at the airport. Samsung has top notch security.,2019-05-09

They oucked it up and sent it back to me after 10 days in which they said that they replaced the screen. After using it for a bit its clear that the top left bleed which they said themselves was really bad is not completely gone, a lot less but can still see it, as well as this it looks like a new spot had appeared on the left side of the TV at the top. I've contacted them and they said a factory reset I should perform, would this even do anything?

They sound fine to me, and as far as bluetooth earbuds go they got a solid connection (latest update helped a lot for me). Easy to connect with a Huawei phone, and even easier with a Samsung device. Also work fine with my Galaxy Watch. &amp;#x200B; For Android mainstream buds these are defintely go-to, better than using Airpods with Android for sure.

Fortunately a friend helped wade through the initial screens and set it to English after which it worked fine.

It's way too big). I've also heard of the OP7P battery draining quick for some people because of the 90 hz. I think I ended up missing one or two features two, but its okay. The OP7P is also having a few random issues (ghost touches and inability to touch in certain areas) and I haven't heard much about their return policy, except for that it isn't great. The curve on the OP7P is also a big difference, because it's not even remotely as perfected as the s10 ones, which still have some issues with palm touches. The selfie camera could also be an issue, because while yes, so far it seems super sturdy and durable, it could fail in years to come, so if OP is looking for more reliable over the years, thsts another issue. The side mounted fingerprint sensor could either be a bonus or a minus, depending on how they feel about it. Same with the UI. Some people love oxygen os, some love one UI. The s10e and the OP7P are pretty evenly matched, but I think the s10e wins, at least in terms of stability for the future.",2019-06-01

On Android 4.4 KitKat and newer, go to Settings and on the Device tab, tap Accessibility. Under the Hearing header, tap Sound balance to adjust the left/right volume balance. Below that setting is a box you can tap to check to enable Mono audio.* *For owners of the Samsung Galaxy S4 (or later), a setting called Adapt Sound gives you even greater control of your audio output. Not every music app supports the feature, but it does work with Samsung's built-in music app and Google Play Music.* *To set up Adapt Sound, put your headphones on and find Adapt Sound in the Sound section of Settings. It will play a series of beeps and sounds at different frequencies, similar to a hearing screening you might have experienced in school growing up. You answer whether you can hear each sound, and the app will then adjust the strength of certain tones and frequencies to help you in areas where you may be deficient....*",2019-06-02

4675,"The Samsung Doorstep Repair Service is provided by a company called WeFix (Rated 9.5/10 on Trust Pilot as of 03/06/2019). To give some background, you can arrange one of these 'Doorstep Repairs' through Samsung's website. They do all the latest S and Note devices and tablets. (All the way back to the S5 and Note 4) as well as some A and J devices. All you have to do to get a quote is your postcode. They use genuine parts. Normally a screen replacement for a Galaxy Note 9 is £229 (a free battery replacement is included) but I managed to win a competition on the Samsung Members app where I received a screen replacement using doorstep repairs for free. Now the booking experience is quite simple, you can select multiple things to be repaired, like the screen, cameras, battery (by itself), ear piece speaker, back glass and the charging port. You can select any weekday to get a repair but do note that you cannot chose a time slot (more on that). After booking my doorstep repair I waited until the day of the repair, where at 8am I received both an email and a text message from WeFix informing me of the hour time slot for my repair, as well as the name of the technician who would be repairing my device. So I waited a few hours until about 11am (about in the middle of the time slot I was given) and the technician arrived in his van. (The vans are quite easy to spot as they have WeFix and lots of information on every side - it's not just a plain white van). The technician was quite friendly and inspected my device quickly before taking it back to his van and repairing it. The whole repair took about an hour, with the screen and the battery being tested. As well, my device was tested to make sure it was still water resistant. When I received my device back, I inspected it myself and it was done brilliantly. Another nice touch is that a plastic screen protector was also applied (and quite precisely) which is good because my screen was previously scratched a fair bit. I also received a discount code that would take 10% off any future repair through WeFix. Overall, the experience and the repair were very good and I would recommend them to anyone who wishes to have their Samsung device repaired. However, one negative of the experience was the amount of emails I received after the repair, about 4 or 5 I got in total after about a day or two afterwards. These emails were all about recommending and reviewing WeFix. I wouldn't mind one or two but 5 is excessive and quite irritating. If you want any further clarification on anything or have any questions, I will try my best to answer them and I hope you found this helpful and a little bit informative. Sorry if it went on for a bit long and thanks for reading!",2019-06-03

The buds are fantastic if you're using a galaxy phone, I've had no issues with using them. They're by far the most convenient pair of buds out there for a galaxy phone. The features are fantastic too: wireless charging, a voice-enhancing hear through feature and built in voice assistant makes these fantastic for daily use. I tend to leave my phone in my bag and just use the voice assistant to control everything. The price: they're dirt cheap obviously, around 100 - 120 euros last I checked, provided you're not actually buying them directly from Samsung. Can't complain about the price. The bad: the sound. As much as I love them, and as much as I use them, I would not recommend them as a main pair of earbuds. They don't support the AptX codec. They sound better using Dolby Atmos, barely.

The main reason to use samsung's apps is that they look clean and most importantly, they ALL have dark mode. Also depending on your region and if you want to use your phone for purchases, use Samsung Pay.

Again, that upper part i twist them into do hurt after prolonged use but i just live with it i guess. They dont always get to this position everytime i put them in, sometimes i need to retry or twist them a bit. I remember seeing an ad on youtube for these buds where the athlete did a twist to put them in, idk if that was just advertising making them look more appealing or if that is how theyre supposed to be put in properly.

If they are still charging that much, you can be sure it's because enough people are paying it that they are making a good profit. When the demand for the 9 goes down, I imagine they will lower the price. You also may find it for a better price if you look somewhere other than Samsung for it.

I guess I could just get the S10+ (or I guess I don't really *need* an upgrade, I have the S8+), but I was hoping that I'd like the Note 10, because I've wanted a phone with the S Pen ever since I got the Galaxy Tab S4.

I bought Galaxy Buds for my S8+ (then proceeded to lose the case after less than a week - Samsung are able to replace it for a decent price, luckily, it just has to go through their repair channels), so I guess the lack of a headphone jack won't affect me too much. But I guess I just like the idea of being able to use whatever headphones I like at any time. Some apps (*glares at Twitch*) don't correctly sync their audio with video when using wireless headphones, so I like to have wired headphones on hand for those cases. As it stands, this is a rumour. There were also rumours that the S8 wouldn't have a headphone jack, and it did (iirc the S10 has similar rumours), so I'm still holding out hope.

In a few years, we could expect a Galaxy Fold with a cheaper price and a glass display instead of the less reliable plastic display it’s using now.

My 7 Edge started slowing down within the first 6 months and was *horrendous* after a year.

And also, the camera setup is going to be staying the same from the S10 series, which is sad as the primary sensor has pretty much stayed the same since the S7.

No issues with sounds desync or anything like that. The only regret I have - color choice. Black color is too simple. White looks cool AF! Wish to rewind and change it to white ... In regards to Apple. I do not belive in 5G. I mean, it is cool. Faster speed and anything like that BUT. The area where I live, I don't even have all stable 4 bars of LTE. Connection is not always that stable with LTE, so 5G won't change anything + too early to tell. X is a good phone. As I said couple months ago, if you don't have any issues with a phone. If it sufficient enough for you - just keep it. If you must switch to something - definitely try Samsung.",2019-06-07

Imit does support map my run and I believe Strava as well. I usually just load up a run on the Samsung health app on my watch and then also run with my phone for the Nike run club. I also can't sync my heart rate to NRC either, but this isn't an issue with the watch per se. I also wear my phone at work and it's great to quickly view notifications on my watch rath aser than pulling my phone out. You can also reply to messages on platforms like WhatsApp and messenger, it has a to format of text, but I don't particularly like that. One of the major downsides for me is the battery life. I get maximum of 2 days usually, and it takes about 2 hours to charge. This can be annoying, particularly for me when I may work a triplet of 13 hour shifts with a run after each shift... I sometimes completely forget it needs charging, and I ideally want at least 30 percent before I go out on a run. As I generally like to keep track of my health, I use Samsung health anyways and it's been ok, I feel like things could be better, but it's good.

That being said, it's still Android, and the high end tablets are still alright. *if you like having a portable desktop experience then DeX is great on Samsung tablets, you can even run full desktop Linux on it (this is also possible on recent Samsung flagships but you'd need an external monitor)",2019-06-09
4944,"After 6.5 days of use... **Galaxy Fit Pros:** \- Very light and small tracker. But device itself is a little thicker than the Charge 3. \- Clearer, higher-resolution screen than the Charge 3. It's nice to be able to clearly read what a notification says. \- A little easier to see in direct sunlight than the Charge 3. Still not perfect. \- Heart rate and step count accuracy seems comparable to my Charge 3. Whew! \- **Synching/notifications work flawlessly** (with my Pixel 3a). Changing a clock face is instantaneous. Vibrations are strong. \- ""Do Not Disturb"" mode, ""Good Night"" mode, both easily accessible from band. No hunting around for hard-to-find settings on tracker or app. \- Can set display brightness from 1-10 on tracker. \- I really like the Samsung Health app. I particularly like that it actually tells me what it is doing when it is synching. It tells me what data it is downloading from the device. Very nice to see instead of Fitbit's useless ""progress bar."" \- The band auto-detected ""workouts"" when I was walking and mowing the lawn. Very nice. Couldn't select ""mowing lawn"" as a workout category, though. \- Not sure if this is a pro or con, but the display turns on when you make an arm movement that is anywhere close to lifting your hand to your face. The Fitbit Charge 3 was the opposite -- sometimes I had to make an exaggerated arm movement just to get the display to turn on. &amp;#x200B; **Galaxy Fit Cons:** \- Poor battery life so far. Just 3 days with HR set to ""Always"". Looks like maybe 4-5 days with it set to ""Frequent"" (every 10 minutes when not working out). Must have to turn off notifications to get the advertised ""about a week."" \- Band is not particularly comfortable, and is very hard to adjust tighter, once you've got it on. Easier just to take it off and start over. Worried about durability of band due to having to fold the end ""under"" when putting it on. People with small wrists might not like this band. \- Although there are many variations of clock faces to choose from, they're not customizable. You have to pick your poison from the available 24 choices. Get ready to see some pinks/yellows/reds on your clock face. \- **Resting** heart rate seemed comparable to what Fitbit told me until I switched the Heart Rate setting from ""Always"" to ""Frequent."" With it set to Frequent, the resting heart rate number doesn't seem even close anymore. \- I regularly see different little icons show up at the top of the clock face, but I have no idea what they are supposed to indicate. \- When I get more than one notification at a time, I'm not sure how to see more than the first one. Scrolling/back doesn't seem to do it. &amp;#x200B; I'm sad that the battery life seems worse than advertised, and I am not a fan of the band on this device (I hope replacement bands become available on Amazon soon), but I do plan to wear the Galaxy Fit until a better option comes along. Samsung should sell a lot of these at the $99 price-point (assuming they ever officially go on sale).",2019-06-09

5168,"It has no Warranty as it turned out the be the Malaysian model. A bonus to that is that the language is set to UK English, so it's pretty easy to go through and change all the settings from UK -&gt; US to make the date, time, etc. all work as expected. The Warranty is definitely NOT active as there is a sticker on the outside advising the Malaysian retailer to activate the Warranty at time of sale to the specific customer, which eGlobal most definitely does NOT do. I looked into it further and there is a special backend system the retailers use to perform this warranty activation...so again, no warranty for this. That all said, so far I've had no issues and the tablet work very well - Pie 9.0, May 1, 2019 Security path level, Galaxy Store access is fine, Google Play indicates ""Device is certified"" under Play Protect, and everything I've expected to work....works. The only even slightly negative issues are: * Battery Life isn't the best - seems Exynos processors may be more power hungry. Also it won't charge with lower power chargers, so some of my older stands/chargers don't charge it...but the QC3 and Adaptive Fast Samsung ones do fine. * Case variety is a bit wanting, since it's not a mainstream US model...and I've not found a good one with auto wake/sleep magnet when open/close. Infiniland makes a couple OK ones. again these are minor quibbles. I'd still recommend it. Ticks all the boxes I've wanted for an Android Tablet since my Nexus 7 died years ago.

In the case of the A10 vs the J3, there are a number of cost cutting moves done. 2GB RAM modules in 2019 are obviously cheaper than they were when the J3 was built, then the construction of the A10 having a nonremovable battery in a sealed plastic body is also cheaper than one with a removable battery. Also Samsung has added additional services which basically give you occasional ad or wallpapers with product placements (you turn this off in the initial setup process), and as you set the phone up, you are presented with a screen of recommended third party apps which is essentially an ad for these apps.

It works with the fingerprint scanner flawlessly, applied with no bubbles, and is literally scratch proof since it's made of a really soft material. If you watch the [installation video]( you can see just how flexible it is. The back protector is made of traditional tempered glass that's supposed to be very shatter resistant. On YouTube they show themselves hammering nails into wood without it breaking but I'm not trying that.

5238,"**Should I get the Tab S4 now, or wait for the Tab S5 to release?** --- So I'm looking to get a tablet. A lot of people have said an iPad is the best buy at the moment, but in my case I don't think that's true. Firstly, the non-pro models have thick bezels, no USB-C ports, and too little storage. The pros are better, but no headphone jack, and no internal SD card slot, means I'd be forced to buy the 512GB or 1TB version, since I require a lot of space. Those are as expensive as high end laptops, at which point I'd prefer a laptop. Meanwhile the Tab S4 on the other hand, is actually under my original intended budget, looks the perfect size, has nice small bezels like the iPad Pros, comes with the pen, comes with proper bluetooth keyboard/mouse support, has a headphone jack, has microSD support.. Couple that with the fact I've owned a Samsung phone before and it had the nicest screen out of any phone I've bought before. Plus, I'm already an Android user, so it means I don't have to figure out alternatives for all the apps I've been using. So it seems like a no-brainer, but just now while reading about Linux on Dex, I noticed mention of a Tab S5 on the site, so I googled it, and some sites are suggesting the Tab S5 will be released next month, with the new Snapdragon 855 processor. This is tempting because while 95% of the stuff I want the tablet for probably isn't too resource intensive, I do like the idea of video editing on my tablet, and I think the extra performance would be seen there.

Now it's been adopted in the following models and no headline since then says anything in the line of ""APPLE DIDN'T RE-INTRODUCE THE HEADPHONE JACK"" because everyone stopped caring. Yes there's people that will never want it to go like yourself but the future is wireless, portless phones. That's the way it is. Being salty about the removal is fine, but stop making the 100th post about the note removing it, we've known for months now that it was going to be a thing. We get it, it sucks, the world is ending, blah blah blah. It was going to happen sooner or later. Just rip off the bandaid and move on. &amp;#x200B; As for the punchhole camera. What's different than the s10? Yeah it's in the middle, so what? People apparently still want a selfie camera and the tech to fit it under the display isn't mature enough to be made mainstream for atleast another 2 gens. &amp;#x200B; Regarding the removal of retina scanning, if you've ever used it you know that it takes long and it sucks. Once samsung finds their version of Face ID everything will be good, but until then just use the fingerprint scanner or face unlock. Yes it's not as secure but bull f\*cking shit if you tell me that you used the retinal scanning each and every day because it's shit. &amp;#x200B; Regarding the wireless buds, they never said they would include it in the phone? It might be a pre-order bonus but that's it. People are switching to wireless every day, look around, airpods are everywhere nowadays because it's conveniant. If you really want the audio experience from a pair of wired headphones just use a DAC or w/e their called to actually get some nice sound from your phone. Or you better get used to that dongle life because it's coming. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; To end this long ass rant. Just find alternatives to the 3.5 jack.

So, I got a Spigen back cover, a quite basic one with higher borders to protect the screen.

Used it for some time but the thing is hanging on the phone when you use it and it's hard to take photos. Though I'm still thrown between the Neon Flip and the Spigen.

5331,"I was playing around in the service menu and changed a couple things, and my Samsung J6201 started bootlooping. It would infinitely power on, get to the Samsung Smart TV logo, then power off, then do the same thing again. From a quick search, it appeared that I had to reset the EEPROM. So I cracked the back of it open and preceded to spend 4-5 hours tinkering with it. The EEPROM chip on my model is the ATMLH536 (circled in blue). Here's the diagram for the chip. Per the SamyGo wiki and other posts there, I tried connecting Vcc and SDA and turned the TV on, it kept bootlooping like normal. I also tried holding it until the display turned on and immediately removed it after, that didn't work either. When I connect Ground and SDA, the TV immediately shuts off, but when it turns on it just keeps bootlooping. I tried connecting Vcc and Ground to SCL, that also didn't do anything. Any help?

After restarting I try to swipe and open the phone, now mind you I have never had a password on my phone in the entirety of owning a cell phone, and find it asking for a password to be unlocked. I freak and panic trying everything I could possibly use as a password to no avail. I wait the billion hours until my service provider is open in the morning. We call Samsung together. The gentleman on the customer service line confirmed it is a known issue and that it is in fact screwing over more people's phones than just me. They also go on to say there is no solution and I need to factory reset the system. So here I am with a wiped phone trying to pick up the pieces from a bunk update that locks you out of your phone.... Be careful!",2019-07-09
5390,"I think the user tries to say, the performance expectation depends on the owner of the phone. I never play games on the phone, my usage mainly leans on videos, internet surf and social media. With that perspective buying a flagship phone just for this light resource usage is waste of money for me. In my opinion phone screens beyond 1080p resolution just marketing gimmicks. No matter how high quality they are, the viewing experience not even a notch of 4k monitors or 4k tv's. More battery consumption is a downside comes with that. A50 is able to record 4k 30fps with Opencamera app. Samsung's camera software not even in par with the camera hardware on the phone. The main 1080p 30fps setting comes with the phone records with 17 megapixels, not even using the full potential of 25mp camera. With the next update samsung gives ultra slow motion and night mod on their camera app. Indian market already got the update. I thing you got the ram and storage data wrong. A50 has 6gb ram and 128gb storage+ microsd option. The budget flagship s10e has the same ram and storage figures. You get more juice with the next steps of S family (duh!). Final words, if you don't use camera much (I took about 30 photos per year) and you don't play games on your phone the A50 worth the money but if photography is important to you, stay away from this phone. If you are a mobile gamer be aware, this phone doesn't perform awesome on ultra settings on most games but anything beside those, you'll pretty much get the same things you get on S series.",2019-07-09

Plus Samsung had an ulterior motive with that because they're pushing Smart Things, one remote to control everything and it won't rely on IR. Same as with removable battery. Instead of manufacturers trying to attract Samsung customers with removable batteries, the majority of them went with Samsung in sealed units. In the case of microSD, many manufacturers kept it and the memory of the S6 and Note 5 simply weren't enough for it to go just yet. The return of the headphone jack now rests on 2 things. 1 is the Pixel. The Pixel 3a brought back the jack in their lineup. If the P4 gets it, then we have a viable competitor to Samsung that has it. 2 is the sales of the Note 10. If it's low and the major reason is the jack.

But if you bought it from an authorized retailer as you said, sometimes the Point of Sale system will not record the IMEI until a few days later or will sometimes just fill in incorrect numbers and send it to the Samsung reporting system (whatever internal database they use to record sale of devices). I`d call up BB and see whats up, Samsung after confirmation from BB with paperwork. However best bet is call up BB and see verify the device as well as the recorded imei on the bill of sale their POS unit registered. Then with that information call up Samsung to rectify the situation if it still happens.",2019-08-03
5587,"Yes, but I'd likely purchase direct from Samsung because I want Dual SIM capability. T-Mobile likely won't offer that? Or can I flash the T-Mobile version to international and buy a dual SIM tray?",2019-08-03

5589,"You should just be able to put the simcard into a new phone with no issues I got my boyfriend to switch from the iPhone 7 (couldn't get a signal due to apples manufacturing, every iPhone 7 had an antenna problem and horrid battery life) to the 3a and he was thankful I got him to switch. The 3a has an astounding camera, way better than apples offerings but not offering multiple lenses. The battery life on it is amazing, it still fits good in one hand, and proformance is more than enough for day to day usage even though it has a low/medium end processor. And it has a headphone jack, which the iPhone didn't have. It's definitely the best phone you can get for under $600 brand new, it's only been out for 3 months. Plus, it deals with the one issue Samsung has: software updates.",2019-08-03
5590,"Some other neat things to mention are call screening. Where I live, we get telemarketers a lot, ever since I got this phone and used Google call screening that screens any number I don't recognize, They've since stopped calling me as often. Also for a $400-479 phone, the AMOLED display panel from Samsung is really really close to the ones on a Samsung flagship. It lacks HDR10 and high level of brightness, but it's very close in display quality. The haptic feedback on this is really top caliber. I also feel safer with a plastic back phone over a glass one. The glossy plastic on edges still keep a premium look.",2019-08-03
5591,If they're in the Samsung ecosystem... bad idea.,2019-08-03

5595,Everyone keeps saying Samsung has continues updates....idk,2019-08-03
5596,"By all means vote with your wallet but if you really think Samsung hasn't accounted for people not buying due to absent headphone jack you're mistaken. You seem to think that anyone who doesn't care about the headphone jack is a casual n00b or a moron, have you considered that the fact that it matters so much to you makes you an edge case? The dongle/USB-C headphones are adequate for most people and wireless headphones for most of the rest; only a very small amount of people can't make either option work for them.",2019-08-03
5597,That's not even remotely true. Google sends updates to not just themselves but to other manufacturers. So Google might be getting update faster because they are direct source but Samsung quickly will add those into the operating system,2019-08-03

5602,"Different strokes for different folks. I don't recall using a phone's heart rate sensor other than to test if it worked. Use my watch's HR sensor instead. And don't keep track of that either. I haven't had the need for an SD card. Phone memory is more than enough. Most of my files are on the cloud (OneDrive) or backed up on an external drive. And I haven't used wired headphones in years, have always used bluetooth, and now, galaxy buds. It's not perfect, but good enough and I'll sacrifice the tiny latency on some apps over having to mess with wires. I know just because I don't use a lot of the things above means neither does everyone, but I can see why with alternatives, Samsung can feel confident in removing them.",2019-08-03

5604,"True, true. I see what you're saying. Maybe it had to be removed to thin the phone. There might be space but with everything so compacted, it could increase heat, who knows.

Anyways for your question.. So far pretty sure no lags and I'm hitting it somewhat hard.. Like I multitask a lot (pdf and notes split screen along with calculator, internet and sometimes youtube in popup window) all without issues.. I also draw in autodesk sketchbook which is pretty smooth on even big canvases like 3000x4500.. Battery is also quite impressive.. I get anywhere from 9h sot (if I crank up the brightness to 70% (which is a lot with this thing..) to like 12h in span of day or even 3.. Now If I was you I would wait for a bit and get tab s6..

5628,For one. The study is quite bias since it only done in Korea where Samsung is responsible for 30% of their GDP. Samsung is also heavily promoted in Korean media.

5630,Ok now we're talking.. I can tell that we are on the same page tho.. I always said that having small top bezel that will house everything is nest solution till they hide the camera under the display.. That's why I hated s10+ (especially.. since s10 is kinda fine but still dumb solution) Anyways s10+ hole is really big and it forces notf bar to be wide so you effectively lose all the space you got and while watching yt or something that space around camera means nothing really .. That design is cool for the first 2min and after that you're like ok but this is so pointless and dumb.. Bezel is much better solution ... I have n8 too and I love it.. if the chin and side bezels were smaller as well as slightly minimizing the top bezel that would be the perfect design in my eyes 👌🏽 And yeah lately upgrades are so small that I don't even buy every new phone (even tho I was crazy for em and was switching every year.. But tbh just 3y ago samsung phones wheren't even close to what they are now.. Like I had note edge and my friend had note 4 that phone got so laggy and battery got fucked after like one year of use and now I use almost 2y old n8 that still works flawlessly with very little lag and battery that is still quite impressive (4h sot and whole day of use which for 3300mah very used bat is pretty good) Now the note 10+ is gonna be huge upgrade from n8 bc it honestly does look much sexier (like sure that hole is not the best solution but I have to admit that I kinda like it and I don't think it'll be that distracting) and has bigger battery (which is for me the biggest thing) has under display fp scanner (also very big for me) and than other stuff like more ram more base storage better chip (which yeah I agree most people don't even need but I do some ps or drawing so I hope I'll notice some improvement) and also better cameras (the wide angle lens in particular).. Now the next year will probably be similar with some improvements but not as drastic as few years ago so I'll probably skip it too and wait for n12,2019-08-04

5639,"I believe connected GPS was added with an update. Overall as my first fitness tracker it's petty good. In terms of battery life, if your using the watch significantly to track exercises, sleep and stream notifications then you get about 5 days of battery rather than the advertised 7. The heart rate tracking has no trouble reading my heart rate. The sleep tracking works well too. The display is really good on the Fit, colours are vibrant and the Amoled is nice. I found that the stress tracking is really just your heart rate when your it's now tracking an activity, i.e., doing press ups and then measuring your stress will read you as stressed. There are lots of widgets on the watch which show the weather, your calendar and let your add cups of water or caffeine. One disappointment is that you can't control your music natively and it requires buying an app, and if an app can let your Fit control music then I'm sure Samsung can implement a software update to add this. I have already received 3 software updates for my Fit though so Samsung are keen to adding and polishing features.

5650,You have to think about the development cost for a soon-to-be retired product. Samsung has about 37 phones per year. It's better for Samsung to focus on the flagship phones no greater than n-2. And Samsung still provides 3 years of updates. The s8 has received pie. iPhone will release updates but remember they got caught by slowing the CPU for better battery life. 4 years iPhone lasted no longer than 2 years because of this issue. Android q will probably be more intense than the Samsung S7 could provide so it is also another decision on why Samsung decided to not put q on. Otherwise imagine the S7 with q being slow and then you hear nothing but complaints about the S7 being slow,2019-08-04

I use it for the same thing basically (split screen of a book and notes or tasks and notes along with popup calculator and browser.. chat or whatever I need and it all works very fluidly) The keyboard deal is nice bc it's a good way to cary it like that and it's obviously nice to have keyboard for like essays or taking notes in class if you're allowed to do that (bc I think I'm not 🙄) What pro version? When? If it's based on android it's not worth the money I'll say that right away since android is limited in pro apps category that anything more powerful than mobil chips is pointless..

Also you can't edit videos or run visual studio to develop apps (which are all things that I would like to do on go but with android it's either limited or not possible..

Also display is good size and high resolution and quality as well as brightness.. And finally battery life is also pretty good with at least 9+h of SOT no matter what.. Also I'm gonna recomend you a few apps to boost the multitasking experience... 1. You wanna hide the navigation bar and switch it up for gestures *this will give you full screen multitasking ability instead of part of the screen being taken by unnecessary bar 2. You wanna get multi star - which will bring back some multitasking stuff from previous system 3. Finally you wanna get task changer which will allow you to hold onto an app from recents and just drag it to left/right to multitask orr drag to centre of the screen to pop it up (and from recent you even like all apps icon and from there you can hold any app from your tablet and drag it into split screen or popup..

If you still have issues after this, type *#0*# into your phone keypad and tap sensor, then at the bottom do a normal scan. Let it run and see if they all pass.

I just swyped the word predict and I got precidentt, precent, percocet and president.

5782,"It's more of a value proposition thing. $1200 for the phone. A typical 2 year lease/loan means you're spending $600/year. An average phone only lasts 2 years before wearing out or feeling slow. The preorders offered $600 trade in and $50 Samsung store credit. This is on top of the usual goodies that are worth usually around $200-$300 to give to all preorders. So it's actually cheaper to upgrade yearly with a pre-order than every 2 years. Even waiting for Black Friday might get me $300 off but how much could I get a trade in for and no free promo gear? Also I don't have the ""I bought this phone on sale 6 months ago, now something new and shiny makes it look like trash and now I have to wait for it"". Also the note 10 is a pretty nice bump with the new fingerprint scanner, cameras, routine speed bumps and also getting 5G capabilities.

I think the galaxy buds only offer an extra 10(I could be wrong. I just remember its a lot less then air pods). I wasn't saying they don't have flaws. I agree almost completely with you on most of that. The only points I disagree on are the fit. At least in my personal experience air pods actually fit pretty nice and never fell out. I have both for a reason. I already had airpods from when I used my iPhone. I only got galaxy buds after I got my S10. I love the galaxy buds for music. But my weekly calls that I have to be on for work they're awful. Even after updates. And I've also have more random cut outs of sound on here then I ever have on airpods.

Either wait for the S11 or... And I hope I don't get chewed out for this, but wait for the Pixel 4. That's basically the iPhone of Android phones. Straight from Google. Superb hardware. More then likely going to be a better camera then anything out there cause their software is so stupid optimized for their phones(really wish they'd make the G camera available for download as an app), and it gets the latest OS updates first and foremost.

Not to say One UI isn't bad but if you want the absolute best Android experience, I really don't think you can go wrong with either or. I don't feel like you'll get a lot out of the s10+ coming from the R. And the pixel 4 is literally like... 2 months away at max. Usually comes out in October. And I'm personally waiting for my note 10+. If the pixel was going to have a stylus I'd wait on that myself but I know they won't. Not for a while. But that's my take.",2019-08-31

5898,"Sure. There are two reasons why iPad OS basically dashed my hopes for my iPad Pro. 1: iOS made sense as a choice for the iPad Pro because it was a pre-packaged OS designed to work really well with touch interfaces. It was very limited, but it did it's limited things quite well. If Apple had intended to fragment the OS to develop more useful productivity features, it would have made far more sense to create a special blend of MacOS that already supported virtually all professional grade software from the beginning. Instead, Apple will almost certainly create an enormous mess of the operating system as it tries to reverse-integrate features that it never anticipated having to deal with because it wasn't build around a desktop environment, meanwhile asking all third party developers in the world to create special iOS and iPad OS versions of their software. It's a huge ask. &amp;#x200B; 2: iPad OS itself failed to impress me. It's still far behind Android, particularly Samsung's flavors with DeX, where productivity is concerned. It's half-hearted mouse support leaves a lot to be desired, things that a Galaxy S8 phone could easily outperform. You gain the ability to pin widgets, another antiquated Android feature. The text editing features seem like a confusing mess, which goes a bit to the design problems inherent mentioned in point 1. &amp;#x200B; Basically, iPad OS fragmented iOS unnecessarily, showing that iOS was probably never the right choice for the iPad Pro whilst simultaneously losing most of the benefits of being part of iOS as it begins to distinguish itself over the next 5 or so years. Simultaneously, the real productivity enhancements are not where they need to be. &amp;#x200B; This isn't to say the S6 or DeX is the clear answer--I guess it's to say that the Surface Pro is the real answer (or really, a desktop workstation). Computer professionals, with the possible exception of digital artists, still want to work in desktop environments because, well, desktop environments are way faster to work in. They were always built for productivity--they're the environments that develop other environments. Furthermore, Apple is still very anti-competitive when it comes to Windows environment connectivity (i.e. the most important one for professionals), failing even to allow third parties to create Continuity-esque applications while deciding not to pursue them on their own. While Apple intentionally kills their own PC-iPad connectivity, Android rapidly expands it, with Your Phone, Airdroid, Samsung Flow and DeX-over-Windows (or MacOS) connections, decisions that save me a great deal of time at work. &amp;#x200B; In the end, the iPad Pro is and will remain a very good device to own, but it will be good at what it was always intended to do, which is basically a luxury Netflix browser or e-mail reader. As iPad OS attempts to figure out how to incorporate more desktop features, it will increasingly become a mess, and it will become more estranged from people who are already familiar with iOS, killing its principle advantage.",2019-08-31
5899,"My coworkers use iPhone and they can't even get their photos out to share.

5900,"So what exactly were you expecting? You bought an Android phone apparently wanting Apple ecosystem integration? Did you also buy a Chromebook or Galaxy Tab or a Surface to replace a MacBook? That is the level of idiocy you are laying out. Do you expect to be taken seriously, or do you understand that you are coming off like a glorified troll? Do you also understand there are people waiting for that device you never intended to keep? BTW, take the smoothness and optimization crap back to an iPhone subreddit where people actually believe it. I use both and that garbage hasn't been true since the S8. As for its biggest Achilles heel being it runs Android. Did you somehow miss that Samsung doesn't make IOS devices? You needed to buy an expensive phone to demonstrate the \[blanking\] obvious? Now with respect to not matching Apple's ecosystem, that phone can interact with most Apple devices, other than the proprietary ones such as your watch. It can also work with any and every Windows device on the market, without the need for something like iTunes. That establishes Android, like Windows, as being an OS that extends across platforms, without restriction. In fact, the phone you are returning is capable of running virtually on those other platforms, not that an iPhone offers anything genuinely comparable on a Mac. Use whatever phone you want. No one really gives a damn either here or in the land of iPhones. If, however, you want to be an ass about it, expect to be treated accordingly.",2019-08-31
5901,"&gt; I've never been interested in them simply because I feel my Note9 has better specs. Now I can't fully answer your question as this is my first Samsung device, but this simply isn't true looking at the specs page. Note 10+ has better processor, more RAM, larger battery, larger and newer display, better S-Pen with added features, up to 1TB microSD support, better camera with the cool AR/DepthVision tech at a hardware level, etc. I've seen people complain about the ultrasonic scanner but coming from the 6T (didn't have issues with that one either), this thing is a miracle and using it with the display off is extremely helpful. You also mention not wanting to lose a headphone jack and dedicated fingerprint sensor while spending $300 more, yet you're thinking about a Pixel 4? As for the last thing you're forgetting, those people can trade in their Note 9 and get a Note 10+ for $499 directly from Samsung. That's more than you can get for a local sale without the local sale hassle, and you're upgrading to the latest Note device if you wish to do so.",2019-08-31

5903,"After using Android for most of my life, I used iPhone 8 Plus for 1 year, and I really hated it. - Can't download files from the internet such as mp3. - Can't share files between app easily. For example, I can't share photos from my Google Photo to Reddit. I had to download to my iphone before I could post it. On Android, you can post almost anything from any app as long as it is applicable. - There is no file management. I feel like I am not the owner of my own contents. On Android, your files are yours to move around, and access with ease. With iPhone, I had to use iTune. If I find a tune I like on the internet, I can't download directly to my phone and make it my ringtone. I would need to download on a PC, then plug in iPhone and sync the tune. - Storage management on iPhone is basically useless. It shows my storage is eating up by some apps, but no way to clear it or view what is it. - iCloud is 5 GB. It is technically useless unless you pay. - The included charger is 5W, basically unchanged since forever. I had to use my Samsung charger for faster charging. Unless you pay more to get a faster charger. - Quick setting is not actually quick. You have to go to setting manually if you want to select anything. - No multitasking, no back button. Sometimes the apps frozen, there was no way to go back 1 step because no back button. You have to close the wholething. - When someone calls you, that calling screen pops right at you with no respect to what you are doing. It could be more, but I am tired lol.",2019-08-31

I dont think I'd be able to go back to iPhone until their screens are closer to samsung in the resolution department and size. The S10+ screen is just top notch imo.,2019-09-01
5918,I never said it was bad... I just simple said it's an ecosystem that seems to suck people in and once you're in it's hard to get out but people are buying in because it works for them. I for one don't miss my Apple Watch all that much nor being able to reply to messages from my iPad(turned iMessage off anyways). As for resolution I'm talking max resolution(3040x1440) on an AMOLED display. With having the ability to change the screen resolution on the fly. The all screen display and no noticeable bezels. Once Apple adds at least a higher resolution and more screen and less bezels then I'll consider switching back.

They tell our customer there's nothing wrong with the phone even though they can't connect to the internet or get calls texts etc. Idk in my experience I've never had issues with my Samsung products after having them for years. The only iPhone I've had that's survived since day one was the 6 which for its time I'll admit was an awesome phone.

5941,"Generally speaking I think that Beats are not the best quality headphones in the world. They sound alright. I own Galaxy Buds, Solo 3, Studio 3, PowerBeats Pro, and recently sold my AirPods 2 to a family member. With that being said, I definitely recommend the Studio 3 headphones over the Solo 3s if you absolutely want Beats branded over the ear headphones. HOWEVER, there are far superior headphones that are better than Beats in all areas for similar pricing. As much as I don't like Beats after spending money on their headphones, I have to say that the **PowerBeats Pro** are very good. They are super comfortable, sound very nice, and they have great battery life. If you want good in-ear headphones I can always recommend those (they're a bit over priced). When it comes to Galaxy Buds, I like them but I don't love them. They are headphones that I keep laying next to my laptop to use them when I'm getting some work done at home. Overall, they're a solid option and when paired with a Samsung phone, they add some good functionality. Since you are comparing in-ear to over the ear headphones I'll rate the headphones out of 5 stars. My rating takes into consideration: build, sound quality, battery life, connectivity, and comfort for prolonged listening time as well as versatility of headphone uses. * **Studio 3** 3 stars * **Solo 3** 2.5 stars * **PowerBeats** 4.5 stars * **Galaxy Buds** 3.5 stars * **Air Pods** 3.5 stars",2019-09-01

5984,"I'm a lifelong Android user. I started with the original TMobile G1 and since then have owned Android's from all the major players.m HTC / Motorola / Samsung etc, I currently have a Google Pixel 2. - I've never owned an iPhone in my entire life, but I do have an iPad. With that said, you have to remember that Apple products are a unison of Hardware and Software working as one. I saw a video a few days ago comparing a brand new Galaxy Note 10+ to an iPhone XS Max, the problem is that's last year's iPhone, literally a year old, and the iPhone was still faster with 4gb of RAM and last year's A12 versus 12 GB of RAM and a new Snapdragon The fact of the matter is the iPhone simply does more with less, it's optimized better that's why 4 year old iPhones still run good as new and aren't all janky. Android's answer is always to throw crazy specs at the phone as an attempt to overcome the unoptimizations. It's like having a car with 800 HP and Square wheels on it, when you can just have a car with 300 HP and round wheels and be just as fast",2019-09-02

6020,"Damn son, you really splurged and got it all, didn't you? I'm thinking of either getting the Samsung Galaxy Fold or the new iPhone 11 Pro or whatever it'll be called. I've used both iOS and Android extensively, and I really want a foldable phone, but I'm also really tired of the disjointed eco system (or lack of an eco system) on Android and also even though One UI is _fine_, I don't love the look of it, and the gesture navigation feels less refined than, let's say OnePlus or Xiaomi's gesture navigation. Don't even know if the Fold has the gestures either, I've only ever seen reviewers use the old nav buttons which is even more boring to me. With the Fold I am also worried about how the screen will age, because I figured I might enter some sort of Samsung Upgrade program if I were to get it, but if the screen gets scratched up so easily I'm wondering how much they vill deduct in value from it when you return it. With the Note 10+ I'm just not sure what I think, it's such a beautiful phone but I still wasn't impressed with it, and I had both the S9/S9+, Note 9 and S10 earlier, and I do like Samsung but I usually find myself wanting to upgrade really fast when I use Samsung phones even if they still are good and can last for quite a while.",2019-09-03

After that I disabled DeX then had to go down to the S's to clear all cache and storages for each Samsung DeX app individually. After that I went to reset and reset all settings not a factory wipe.

Money isn't an issue so don't take that into account (i'm not rich or some braggy stuff, I just like splurging on new tech when I can). I really love new stuff and I think the Fold would serve me well if they've fixed the screen issues, but also a tried and true concept like the iPhone appeals me, because I want a phone I can keep for awhile, at least a year (thinking of going with upgrade programs of some sort). Previously i've switched phones like every few months but i can't afford to keep that up anymore. So far this year i've had the S10, XS Max, Huawei P30 Pro and probably something else that i'm forgetting, and right now i'm just borrowing a Samsung A8 (2018) from my friend (my daily driver managed to die on me) while i'm waiting to see what comes out this autumn (Galaxy Fold, iPhone 11 Pro, Pixel 4, Vivo Nex 3, Xiaomi Mi Mix 4, etc) and it's not been good for my case usage.",2019-09-03

Let alone that they've decided it was a good idea to remove the headphone jack, among other things like heartrate sensor which you can consider a niche feature on the Note 10+, which is supposed to be from a phone line considered as a no compromises swiss army knife of phones. If you still want something new and don't care about having S Pen get S10+, it's slightly more powerful, has a slightly larger battery and still retains all features Note 10+ dropped. But in the end I still think you should keep the Note 9 as it's the Samsung sweet spot, and the bezels look less dated than let's say S9 and S9+ (Which I can't believe my S10+ spoiled me enough to say that).",2019-09-03

6145,"(copied from a previous post I made a few days ago, because I'm lazy) The first thing I noticed was the size of the tablet itsself, it's a lot smaller than I was expecting. The next thing was how much screen Samsung have managed to fit into such a small form factor. I've not had much time to really use it today, but as far as speed/performance go, it'll be right up there with the S/Note 10. I opted for the 256GB model with 8GB of storage, purely because it wasn't that much extra money in the grand scheme of things, and almost seems like good value (if anything can truly be 'good' value when it costs the better part of a grand. The screen is exactly what you'd expect, good colours, nice responsiveness (one thing which worried me was how responsive the pen would be when writing, as it's only a 60Hz display - thankfully it's great), it gets fairly bright, but I'm currently locked out of my house and typing this in the garden on an overcast day, and it's only just bright enough with almost no headroom left. I did notice while walking with it in my hand or tucked under my arm that becuase it's very dense it does get a bit tiring, and can be slightly cumbersome to carry for long distances. I'd recommend putting it into a bag or something. I'm typing this using the keyboard case and I've got say it's much more useable than I expected. The keys are the right sort of shape to hit one one by one (no accidentally pressing three at once) and the trackpad integration seems really god so far. I had a little play around with DeX while on the bus, so didn't really use it, but it's very easy to switch in and out of it. The cameras seemed a little pointless on paper, but having used them I can see the appeal of just snapping a shot of a piece of paper on your tablet and writing on it the S pen rather thah getting your phone out and having to bluetooth it to yourself. The images it takes are fairly low resolution, but they still look pretty good in all the other ways that matter - realistically, the sorts of people who think it's socially acceptable to take pictures on a tablet will buy something cheaper like a Tab A, or FireHD8. Finally, the feature that swung it for me and made me decide to actually buy this beatiful thing - the S pen. It's comfortable in the hand, if a little oddly shaped (you get used to it basically immediately), the magnetic charging is a really nice feature, and it was fully charged within minutes, and hasn't dipped much below 100% yet today. Drawing/writing is a smooth experience and feels really nice - the pressure sensitivity is really good and allows you very fine control over your 'brushstroke'. The case also hides the pen very nicely and holds it securely - I wish I'd realised the case had a large adhesive part before I shoddily applied it and had to peel it off (which took a lot of force, this thing isn't falling off any time soon). Minor issues: the backspace/delete key is in a slightly odd place, and the Fn+DeX combo uses the full reach of one hand for me (from C3 to D4 on a piano). Caps lock has randomly been on by default a few times. I had to spend a good half hour updating everything out of the box (not that this is unusual). I can't seem to change the two finger scroll direction on the trackpad. I've not had a great experience with the fingerprint scanner either - I might try adding the same thumb in landscape and portrait modes (face unlock has been damn-near instant, but you still have to swipe to open the tablet even after it's unlocked). I haven't had a chance to test the speakers or the video watching experiene as a whole, but honestly that's not somthing I'll be using this tablet for. It cost more than my laptop, and honestly I prefer this keyboard (despite the annoyingly small left shift key), it feels like the best 'netbook' ever created. The keyboard simply pulls off and you can use it as a standalone tablet (this is nice becuase the roughness of the back half of the case gives you something extra to grip - the metal feels premium, and I'd much rather have that than glass on a tablet, but it's very smooth.",2019-09-04
6146,Main reason is there's just so many Android phones. Comparing Apple to Android isn't right. You have to compare Apple to Samsung for a fair comparison.

6157,"Ask any retailer and they will be happy to explain: 1) Samsung offers steep discounts out of the gate. This undercuts the value of the device since it is easy to figure out the ""suggested retail"" game where that is only really the price for really foolish people. 2) Most android phones either aren't that expensive to start or, well, come off as cheap. 3) Android is horribly fragmented and Android phones are not expected to be updated for five years. As a result, many (probably most) aren't designed to last that long. 4) Like them or not, Apple produces products that look premium, last longer, and will be updated for five years. Their marketing is also far more sophisticated (and effective). That gives them the image of premium in a sea of ""cheap"" devices. 5) Apple does not really discount it products in the same was any Android OEM. They offer discounts but they are within a formula and otherwise often do have people buying at sticker price. Microsoft does the same thing with Surface products. If you pay attention, you know the discount cycle. Between that cycle you pay the full price. Samsung seemed to be moving that direction but its discounts on S10s and Note 10s suggest they are simply going back to the Android approach with a higher starting price. As to how this works out in the real world, I sold my iPhone XR for more than I actually paid (had some credits so it was well under $500 and I sold it for $500 in only a few days. I also sold my Apple Watch for only $50 less than I paid last year. When I dumped the Xr (which I hated) and switched to a S10e, my actual cost was less than $100. When I traded that in on a Note 10, between the $600 trade and more than $100 in additional discounts, it cost me less than $250 to get the Note 10.

6162,Thinking about buying a smart band or a smart watch and already own a Galaxy S9. There's any advantage of buying a Samsung product instead of another company? And anyone bought a Galaxy Fit or Galaxy Fit E and can tell how is your experience?,2019-09-04
6163,Currently rocking an s8 plus which I got for 500 usd. Since then prices have gotten crazy. My phone is still a rockstar but makes me wonder if I want to support the business practice in the future. Part that annoys me is that these days Samsung has killer software which gets my favor in that regard by default.,2019-09-04
6164,"Omg thank u so much! I usually don't have issues like this and I couldn't find an answer, so I really appreciate it. This is my first Samsung phone and I just upgraded from android 6.0 so I'm still getting used to a lot of the new features. Thanks once again!!!! :D",2019-09-04
6165,"I have used these Universal Car Phone Mount Magnetic - Reliable iPhone Car Mount for Any Smartphone or GPS - Truly One-Handed Cell Phone Holder for Car Dashboard I also have the S-View case for the Note 10+ and unlike past S-View cases I didn't need to stick the metal plate to the back of the case. It's just sitting inside between the case and the phone, not even glued down. The trick is to put it in the bottom third of the case area. It can still be charged via wireless pads (I have the Samsung versions) though if the phone is not positioned correctly it won't charge. It's not a very precise positioning, and now I can literally reach back behind me and place it on my nightstand perfectly every time. Just reposition the plate until you have an easier time dropping it on the charging stand with no issues. Like I said, the mount in my truck holds my phone no problem.",2019-09-04

6174,Unfortunately not. Samsung switched back to bottom firing speakers on the 2019 A series.,2019-09-04
6175,In my experience quite a lot of bottom firing speakers seem weak. Had two Nokia Nokia 8 and 8 sirocco when they were knew and ended up returning due to the speaker quality. A8 has been perfect in this regard and more than enough in every other way. Hope Samsung will go back to that design in the future.,2019-09-04

6178,"Seriously! Samsung's ecosystem is honestly great, and they've improved it so much this year which makes me super proud to be a Samsung Knight. I got the 6 Series Smart TV, S10 5G, Tab S4, Galaxy Watch, Galaxy Buds, and 2019 Notebook 9 Pro. I got other things too (like the Wireless Charger Duo) but that's the main part of my ecosystem and it all works so well. If I ever need to get pictures from Samsung Cloud on my Notebook I open Samsung Gallery, my Galaxy Tab shows me my Samsung Notes from my phone, Galaxy Watch unlocks my Notebook, I'll browse Samsung Internet on my Smart TV with the bookmarks already loaded on there, and more. Of course there's a lot more Samsung apps on the devices to cover all the areas, but I'm happy with it.",2019-09-04
6179,"It's all working well so far! Samsung notes syncing across both is perfect. I'm absolutely loving the tab s6 so far, and I love my old tab a6 10.1 (which I got for free with a deal from my phone network plus a super cheap data sim), so fingers crossed that longterm I'll feel the same way about this phone! Ive got a Fitbit at the moment which is only 8 months old (well, actually the one on my wrist is only 3 weeks old, given the first one overheated and had to get replaced under warranty) but I'm considering a samsung gear type tracker if it dies again. Although the fitbit is working fine so far and notifications are coming through with no problem, so as long as it keeps working, I'm not in a hurry to upgrade",2019-09-04
6180,"The prices for the flagships from both apple and samsung have gotten a bit crazy! At least samsung have put out some good midrange and entry priced handsets, too. I'm ok with there being a whole line up to choose from to suit different budgets. But yeah, the industry is suffering from serious price inflation at the top end imo",2019-09-04

6182,"Yeah I looked on Samsung's website, Verizon, and everywhere and I don't see it. I got the Galaxy Tab S4 on Verizon and I do have to agree with you it makes such a difference. Sure, it may be easy to just hit the hotspot button in Samsung Flow, turning on your hotspot from your phone and connecting to it, but the convenience of having cellular already is just something else man. I love it. I'm always bringing this thing around with me too so it makes sense.",2019-09-04

The 128gb cellular is available a bit more widely, but I wanted the RAM upgrade. I've only got 2gb data on the tablet, but it's enough to download the document I'm working on, or a magazine on readly or to check for my emails and reply to them on the go.

6190,Yeah I'm confident Samsung isn't going to make the same mistake twice. And yes it would take at least a month before some YouTuber or consumer takes it through daily use test cases for wear and tear effect.

6194,"It definitely would be and upgrade for me. The main issue with the s8 is battery, not performance but battery life. 3000mah is just isn't good enough. 4500 on the a70 + 25w fast charging is amazing.

The phone thinks there's an external microphone attached so the internal microphone is switched off.

I did use gcam for night mode and some portraits but now that night mode came out for the Note 9 I deleted it. One less app and it is really pretty good. I think the camera is much better since release and having dual aperture is great, but I think samsung is not using it's full potential. I think they are terrible at AI machine learning and should just let Google do this for them, drop bixby and stop this none sense. Also Food mode is not just for food, creates a nice blur effect for all items similar to the Lens feature in gcam for none people photos.",2019-09-06

6295,"Personally, before this launched I preferred the design of the Active Series 1 over the Galaxy Watch, but the lack of a rotating bezel was too much of a downgrade for me. This one having a haptic bezel is a great development, but not sure how it will affect battery life and durability in the long term. I think coming from the Huawei, any of the smaller variants (including the Active Series 1) would be too much of a downsize for you (unless you want that!) Either the Galaxy Watch 46mm or the Active Series 2 44mm would be great. The Active (pictured) is much more sleek, modern and lightweight, whilst being brighter and more vivid. But the GW is more durable and more traditional HOWEVER... There may be a _slight_ change of pace and/or learning curve when coming from Android WearOS to Samsung Tizen! You won't have the same app store or interface, and things like watch faces and preferences aren't transferrable. If you wanted to stick with WearOS, something like the Ticwatch or Fossil devices might be a better experience for you!",2019-09-06

I believe we are gonna to see some new things every 2-3 years, just like portrait / blur mode was created 3-4 years ago, then night mode, now the ""TOF"" sensor is what they really putting efforts here, maybe we will see some great things when this sensor become older.",2019-09-06

Its just pretty to look at and people will like to chose that over any other phone. and oneplus phones are very great! the cameras arent going to be on par with any flag ship on the market right now but its really great camera non-theless and will suit anyones needs. If you really like cameras though, you should of probably just stuck with the pixel. all in all, i dont think you dumb, alot of people like the refreshrate and to me its a gimmic and an unnecessary battery waster, but it looks HELLA nice, but for me i would rather have a bigger batter that lasts, and a higher screen res... and wireless charging!",2019-09-30

6325,"I currently run a Note 10+ and an iPhone 11 Pro. The Note is amazing for media consumption. Android does really well with PiP and Split and the large screen is phenomenal for it. Also, for my setup file management is easier on the Note. Want to d/l Usenet, Torrents or files from your Plex server no problem as Android allows background task running. Also, a lot more choices for the apps on Android. You also have the option of expandable storage so you can sync more content. My iPhone is my choice for my social media apps and photography. I find taking and editing pictures more pleasant on iOS. Plus, the quality and quantity of the editing apps combined with iOS color management across apps is superb. For these cases I prefer Apple for its background app management. I get rock solid consistent battery on the go. Where with Android it can be unpredictable. When I first switched I just uploaded my iCloud photos to Google Photos and then deleted the iCloud library backup and turned it off. Kept an archived copy on my server just in case. Now everything just gets backed up to Google and then within Google photos I use the free up device storage after the backup is finished. If you’re like me and really into tech and open minded to both platforms I think you’ll really enjoy it. For support, as a tech literate person, I just learned to figure it out on my own. The curve was relatively small. But, any Samsung forum or reddit is a great choice. Learn how each best suites your certain usage scenarios and learn to utilize it for those.

I have a new 2.0 hdmi cable and have enabled 4K and hdr on the Xbox. I’ve also tried toggling YCC 4:2:2 on and off. I’ve reset the tv to factory settings, swapped hdmi inputs and make sure the firmware is up-to-date. Has anyone encounter this before? At the point I’m assuming it’s a hardware issue unless anyone knows additional settings I can adjust. Also does anyone know what the process of repairing a tv out of warrant is like?

Their current promotion where you get a $200 credit for accessories says it will last until Oct 11. Is it likely they'll bring back the higher trade-in deal after that?

I plan on figuring out on how to get the best call quality with the Galaxy Buds in a loud space. 3. The bass can get better if you get the Comply tips specifically for the Galaxy Buds which reduce external noise hearing. You can also use the Wearable app to add more bass in your sounds. For optimal sound settings, I would try using the most correct eartips possible. 4.

Basically they used to be like Sony, but only now are moving into emulating what Apple did but isn't there yet, but they can't just link everything together just like that at the snap of a finger. The Airpods and Sennheisers likely use industry standard protocols, but from what I could tell from the Galaxy Buds they're designed to work with the Galaxy phones and that's it.

Personally I use mostly Samsung apps. The Samsung browser, for example, is way better than Chrome. It uses Chromium engine, has a better night mode (no sudden bright white loading/splash screens), anti tracking/ad blocking extensions, and can sync bookmarks to any Chromium based browser or Firefox on a desktop/laptop. It can also be used as the device assistant with a customizable search engine of choice. Google Photos is great in it has unlimited photo backup. I don't use it personally because I realize I'll just end up with a metric ton of photos there. I keep them just backed up on Samsung cloud so I can better manage them from growing too many and delete from time to time.

The worst part of this phone is the Standby time kills battery. I have everything off - AOD, Sync (I just sync my Gmail myself), location (rip rewards), low brightness with a max of 40% which is plenty bright anyway and 20-0% at night, a lot of the gestures like lift to wake etc, Samsung edge turned off, whatever I can turn off that isn't useful or I need really. Can't think of anything more ATM. I always keep my phone topped up during the day anyway as I'm usually always near a charger. Other than the battery optimisation, the phone is near perfect.

If you want to wear white obvious headphones everywhere that make you look like you don't want to talk to anyone in public, airpods may be more your speed. Also, airpods don't encapsulate sound very much, they're pretty loose in the ear, so wearing them everywhere is possible because someone can talk to you and you can hear them. Samsung buds on the other hand encapsulate very well. The rubber nub on the earbud keeps the sound in very well, and makes it hard for your experience to be disturbed by ambient noise, and even loud noise. For this reason, there is a setting that lets the bud mix in ambient sound while you're using them (through the existing mic on the bud) which makes it LESS encapsulated, but only when you choose.

6503,"Considering manufacturers like Samsung and Apple can make money via selling their own bluetooth earbuds/headphones, I'd say unlikely. IMO it's not about the 0.05¢ per unit or whatever they save by excluding the headphone jack, it's about the money they make selling their Galaxy Buds, AirPods, Beats headphones or whatever.

6505,"1) This isn't a Samsung support site so no one can give you the answer you want. 2) What some jackass pontificator on the internet says about space needs to be taken with the same grain of salt as everything else said by jackass pontificators on the internet. There is more to assessing space then going ""oh, I opened the phone and it looks like there is space."" 3) Based upon industry trends, a reasonable opinion would be there isn't a snowball's chance in Phoenix of there being a headphone jack in the S11. It isn't just the phone design (which is still speculative) that needs to be considered. They spun their marketing to discount the headphone jack and you can expect a united front on the flagships going forward. Given robust Note sales, which are better than the past couple models, there is no reason to expect back tracking. 4) Whether it is a Samsung flagship or an iPhone, they are all precisely engineered devices. Armchair engineers can blather on to their heart's content but that doesn't make everything marketing BS just because they say so.",2019-10-03

6520,"The Battery of Note 10: The talk-time of Note 10 dissected for you! Samsung Note 10 is the latest Samsung product that came into the market last year. The product was hailed as groundbreaking by the Samsung company because of its stronger RAM, processing power and the ability to give the user a strong experience. But now, the product has to be vetted for one major factor, and that is, the battery of Samsung Note 10. The Samsung Note 10 has a battery life of 9 to 10 hours a day and is considered some of the highest battery times the brand has provided in recent history. Now, here we come with the breakdown of various other time frames that are significant in assessing the quality of the product. **LTE 2.0Gbps:** Samsung launched the Exynos 9 Series 9820 Processor that takes the 2.0 Gbps LTE Advanced Pro Modem that the company is taking great pride in. The product has the neural processing unit (NPU) which is a greatly advanced processing system. Android works with the artificially intelligent system that focuses on the intelligent learning of the patterns that the person follows and developing an android’s behavioral pattern that will cater to the user’s pattern of thinking. This will make sure that the device runs smoothly and will also troubleshoot issues that occur due to over usage of the same few features over and over again. **PROCESSOR 7nm:** NM in this context is nanometer, the thickness of the transistors used in the androids is of 7nm and the product will have the 7nm of transistor capacity. This will make the CPU considerably powerful and will make the product easier to use. The processing power means that even though the product has multiple heavy-handed features, the processor can handle the burden and will make the product quickly. The Note10 has been in the market for a year now and the product does not hang that often. **RAM 12GB:** The RAM in [Note 10 plus]( is 12 GB and this is the main reason that the device has such power. Usually, the products cannot even offer a 10GB RAM of processing speed by the Processor with 7nm of transistor potential combined with the 12 GB of RAM will give you a device that will run like a horse. No matter how heavy your products are, you will have a successful device that does not hang up usually. **Internal Storage:** The device has an internal storage of 512 GB that is a stronger internal storage capacity than most of the laptops and computers that are available in the market. The reason is that the internal storage in this device is designed to allow the user to download heavy tv shows and similar content so that they can enjoy the content on the Hi-definition android. These are the main reasons you should have Note 10 on your next shopping list. This is a great product for you and your family. Share your thoughts in the comments section.",2019-10-03

6523,"Hi! Thanks for the reply. One thing holding me back is that the keyboard case Samsung makes seems to be junk. Reviews say the magnets aren't very strong and it wobbles around when closed, which is not a good look.

The A series were their testbed for implementing new features before being ported to the flagship ones. But ever since competition in the midrange got stiffer, other phones in the range especially ones from the Chinese market, were offering dual or triple camera, big memory and powerful graphics, all while in a plastic body without any IP rating and people were picking them up, thus Samsung realizing that maybe these were not necessary on the mid range lineup. That's why they refreshed the midrange lineup and offered the A*xx* series as the upper midrange while the M*xx* series were the lower/budget lineup. Also, I guess it is hard to implement water resistance when using plastic. I mean, the S5 had it before but it was not fully sealed still since the plastics flex too much.",2019-10-04

6573,"I don't know your routine/much information from this post, and potentially you have a faulty battery, but I will say, coming from an iPhone to Samsung, it's likely you need to have a proper deep look into your phone settings and see what is going on... On an iPhone, things tend to be managed a certain way by iOS but Android gives you a lot more customisation and choice... Because of this, you should check certain things that you might want more control over, for example, what apps are running heavy in the background and killing your standby time? You should be able to manage permissions and turn off any unnecessary processes to save up some battery life. If you go really hard into cutting off features (some people don't want to) you can make a phone last a lot longer on a single charge. Make sure and check that no apps have sneakily ended up in the Device Maintenance &gt; Battery &gt; Unmonitored Apps section, because I've know some heavy apps to end up here (not sure how or why) and they're then allowed to eat away at your battery without any warning",2019-10-04

They've had this for several generations now, AFTER a ""beta test"" with the S6 and S7. To go backwards on their design principles would be a bad look. 4. Pretty sure 45W is the fastest in any phone right now. And the 25W (I think?) Included in the box is already insanely fast. Not sure what else you're expecting here. 5. Also gone for good. And the prevalence of smart TVs make the IR blaster even less relevant. Samsung doesn't want you to use an IR blaster, they want you to hook up the Smart Things remote via Wifi.

They probably will go at least 90hz display and the camera is getting a new major overhaul, rumoured to be 100+ something megapixel camera, which I'm hoping will have new and improved software. Still, the Note 10+ is currently a great choice and of course, still rather new. If you can hold out, which to me it sounds like you can then hold out or if you cannot hold out then just bite the bullet and get the note 10+. Personally I'd save my money and wait until next year. I really don't think that the Note 10+ is a huge upgrade over the note 9 or even the note 8.",2019-10-05

6631,"Ok 2 things. 1)There is link to windows 2) Samsung dex 1) Link to windows: allows all my notifications to come to my phone and i can mirror my phone. Reply to text as well. This is done by downloading the my companion app on Microsoft store. The app is already preinstalled in the note10 as part of the partnership with Microsoft. Goal: to create similar experience for android users just like iphone and macbook. 2) Samsung Dex: more of a semi-virtual computer. More so as using your phone as a makeshift computer. Tip: from my experience(owner of the Samsung notebook9 pro 2019), dex is better using a monitor than a laptop. For those curious, i use the Samsung $89.99 multiport adapter. Goal: pc portable computing. Similarities of Dex and Link to Windows: - both can see notifications - both can receive files -both can send/reply messages Apps that are not officially supported will not be fully optimized, but may work. Fun fact, as of 2weeks ago when i used dex(windows), Netflix would not work, but when used only with a monitor, Netflix worked.",2019-10-05
6632,"I would argue they're more powerful, not from raw specs but in flexibilityof the operating system and the plethora of features. As far as biometrics go, Samsung does need to improve facial recognition; they do have a secure fingerprint scanner though, unlike Apple's newest, which is a nice advantage for me unless Apple's facial recognition works in the dark without having to bump up the screen's brightness at all. iCloud sounds just as good as OneDrive, which can seamlessly connect Samsung's products and, unless I'm mistaken, you only get ⅓ of the free storage Samsung gives. Funny enough, I saw a side-by-side picture comparison of the Note10 and iPhone 11 Pro on Twitter the other day the one I liked more and thought might be the iPhone(because of how much praise Apple gets about their camera) was actually the Note10. Price-wise, Apple's not very different from Apple on the high end, in some cases being more expensive.

6703,Welcome to the s10 gang lol. If Samsung keeps going in the right direction on their future galaxy s line phones like they did with the s10s I think a lot more people will give them a chance,2019-10-06

6705,Samsung Galaxy E5,2019-10-06
6706,"Fr real I lost $20 at the sport shop when I was an adolescent and that was too harsh a punishment , losing a s10 would SUCK but I'm 90% sure I'm one of the rare few who go through settings debloat with adb etc etc. And my iPad has a 'find device even while offline' option which is likely to have a samsung corresponding feature and my point is most people likely auto-accept 'secure ur device in case ever goes missing' aka sign into samsung account and find lost phone GPS features, I would recommend googling xda message boards or even calling samsung help line with a spoon in the magic jack",2019-10-06

6721,"Not technically Galaxy but their original Samsung Wave running their own (and quite bad) Bada OS. While the OS may have been bad (it had Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja though) the hardware was ahead of its time. It had an aluminum body that felt strong as hell. It had a surprisingly good 5mpix camera with flash (which many phones did not have at the time). As far as Galaxies go my S4 is the phone I got after Wave, and it works really well.",2019-10-06

Mind you, it was launched before iPhone so the damn thing is really old, but still works to this day. I think my parents got it in like 2007-2008 and it was the phone I was using all the way to 2014 april iirc. It resisted so much I'm amazed it still works. The Sim card slot tho got dented while I was trying to get the sim card out of it and I bent a few pins accidentaly. All the other things about it still work tho.",2019-10-06
6730,"Unfortunately not, I asked that of the Samsung tech rep, and they said that because I took it to a fixit shop that wasn't a certified Samsung repair shop, my warranty is voided and there's nothing they can do to help me but to point me to another fixit shop",2019-10-06
6731,I am not sure if the fast charger is the problem. Fist Gear s3 don't support fast charge for what I know so it should charge at normal rate. Second I have Samsung wireless battery pack with Fast Charge support on the both wireless charger and the wired ports. Using it all the time for my gear s3 and it gets warm but not hot and that it is also in the summer with some high temps here.,2019-10-06

6741,"My school has Samsung Smart TVs, so whenever I have to do presentations I just screen mirror from my phone. Compared to iOS, the fact that I can store and manage files like PowerPoints and Word documents make my life a lot easier. My phone now also acts as a mini laptop of sorts. We share files quite often, so Samsung's link sharing helps a lot too, together with the USB-reading capabilities. What I've been very pleased with lately though is Samsung DeX. This feature is insane. It makes everything so seamless, and whenever I find myself at a place without any internet connection I can use DeX instead of a hotspot. Using mobile hotspot for a laptop is horrible for me because it wastes all my data. I haven't really used the S-Pen all that much, but it's a feature I'd rather have and not need than need and not have. It has its moments.",2019-10-06

The model # is NP930MBE-K01US, where in the world can I get a replacement key without being without my laptop because I cannot live without it? (major needs lots of CS, I skype with my gf, etc).

I always said that having small top bezel that will house everything is nest solution till they hide the camera under the display.. That's why I hated s10+ (especially.. since s10 is kinda fine but still dumb solution) Anyways s10+ hole is really big and it forces notf bar to be wide so you effectively lose all the space you got and while watching yt or something that space around camera means nothing really .. That design is cool for the first 2min and after that you're like ok but this is so pointless and dumb.. Bezel is much better solution ... I have n8 too and I love it.. if the chin and side bezels were smaller as well as slightly minimizing the top bezel that would be the perfect design in my eyes 👌🏽 And yeah lately upgrades are so small that I don't even buy every new phone (even tho I was crazy for em and was switching every year.. But tbh just 3y ago samsung phones wheren't even close to what they are now.. Like I had note edge and my friend had note 4 that phone got so laggy and battery got fucked after like one year of use and now I use almost 2y old n8 that still works flawlessly with very little lag and battery that is still quite impressive (4h sot and whole day of use which for 3300mah very used bat is pretty good) Now the note 10+ is gonna be huge upgrade from n8 bc it honestly does look much sexier (like sure that hole is not the best solution but I have to admit that I kinda like it and I don't think it'll be that distracting) and has bigger battery (which is for me the biggest thing) has under display fp scanner (also very big for me) and than other stuff like more ram more base storage better chip (which yeah I agree most people don't even need but I do some ps or drawing so I hope I'll notice some improvement) and also better cameras (the wide angle lens in particular)..

There are lots of widgets on the watch which show the weather, your calendar and let your add cups of water or caffeine. One disappointment is that you can't control your music natively and it requires buying an app, and if an app can let your Fit control music then I'm sure Samsung can implement a software update to add this.

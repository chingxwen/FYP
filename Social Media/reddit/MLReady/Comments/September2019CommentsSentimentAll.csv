42,2019-09-01,"[""Sure. There are two reasons why iPad OS basically dashed my hopes for my iPad Pro. 1: iOS made sense as a choice for the iPad Pro because it was a pre-packaged OS designed to work really well with touch interfaces. It was very limited, but it did it's limited things quite well. If Apple had intended to fragment the OS to develop more useful productivity features, it would have made far more sense to create a special blend of MacOS that already supported virtually all professional grade software from the beginning. Instead, Apple will almost certainly create an enormous mess of the operating system as it tries to reverse-integrate features that it never anticipated having to deal with because it wasn't build around a desktop environment, meanwhile asking all third party developers in the world to create special iOS and iPad OS versions of their software. It's a huge ask. &amp;#x200B; 2: iPad OS itself failed to impress me. It's still far behind Android, particularly Samsung's flavors with DeX, where productivity is concerned. It's half-hearted mouse support leaves a lot to be desired, things that a Galaxy S8 phone could easily outperform. You gain the ability to pin widgets, another antiquated Android feature. The text editing features seem like a confusing mess, which goes a bit to the design problems inherent mentioned in point 1. &amp;#x200B; Basically, iPad OS fragmented iOS unnecessarily, showing that iOS was probably never the right choice for the iPad Pro whilst simultaneously losing most of the benefits of being part of iOS as it begins to distinguish itself over the next 5 or so years. Simultaneously, the real productivity enhancements are not where they need to be. &amp;#x200B; This isn't to say the S6 or DeX is the clear answer--I guess it's to say that the Surface Pro is the real answer (or really, a desktop workstation). Computer professionals, with the possible exception of digital artists, still want to work in desktop environments because, well, desktop environments are way faster to work in. They were always built for productivity--they're the environments that develop other environments. Furthermore, Apple is still very anti-competitive when it comes to Windows environment connectivity (i.e. the most important one for professionals), failing even to allow third parties to create Continuity-esque applications while deciding not to pursue them on their own. While Apple intentionally kills their own PC-iPad connectivity, Android rapidly expands it, with Your Phone, Airdroid, Samsung Flow and DeX-over-Windows (or MacOS) connections, decisions that save me a great deal of time at work. &amp;#x200B; In the end, the iPad Pro is and will remain a very good device to own, but it will be good at what it was always intended to do, which is basically a luxury Netflix browser or e-mail reader. As iPad OS attempts to figure out how to incorporate more desktop features, it will increasingly become a mess, and it will become more estranged from people who are already familiar with iOS, killing its principle advantage.""]",0.073,0.747,0.179,0.9957

I own Galaxy Buds, Solo 3, Studio 3, PowerBeats Pro, and recently sold my AirPods 2 to a family member. With that being said, I definitely recommend the Studio 3 headphones over the Solo 3s if you absolutely want Beats branded over the ear headphones. HOWEVER, there are far superior headphones that are better than Beats in all areas for similar pricing. As much as I don't like Beats after spending money on their headphones, I have to say that the **PowerBeats Pro** are very good. They are super comfortable, sound very nice, and they have great battery life. If you want good in-ear headphones I can always recommend those (they're a bit over priced). When it comes to Galaxy Buds, I like them but I don't love them. They are headphones that I keep laying next to my laptop to use them when I'm getting some work done at home. Overall, they're a solid option and when paired with a Samsung phone, they add some good functionality. Since you are comparing in-ear to over the ear headphones I'll rate the headphones out of 5 stars. My rating takes into consideration: build, sound quality, battery life, connectivity, and comfort for prolonged listening time as well as versatility of headphone uses. * **Studio 3** 3 stars * **Solo 3** 2.5 stars * **PowerBeats** 4.5 stars * **Galaxy Buds** 3.5 stars * **Air Pods** 3.5 stars""]",0.038,0.809,0.152,0.9693

Don't even know if the Fold has the gestures either, I've only ever seen reviewers use the old nav buttons which is even more boring to me. With the Fold I am also worried about how the screen will age, because I figured I might enter some sort of Samsung Upgrade program if I were to get it, but if the screen gets scratched up so easily I'm wondering how much they vill deduct in value from it when you return it. With the Note 10+ I'm just not sure what I think, it's such a beautiful phone but I still wasn't impressed with it, and I had both the S9/S9+, Note 9 and S10 earlier, and I do like Samsung but I usually find myself wanting to upgrade really fast when I use Samsung phones even if they still are good and can last for quite a while.""]",0.10300000000000001,0.816,0.081,-0.6892

I eventually got through to a woman at Best Buy headquarters somewhere in the East (I live on the West Coast) and she told me ""let\'s check the status..... your phones have been waiting at your local Best Buy for a week now."" ?!?!?!? She then explained that somebody at Best Buy corporate headquarters messed up and mixed up all of the serial numbers nation-wide on all the new pre ordered Note 10 / Note 10+ s with their respective customers and that is why nobody is getting their phones (or they already have gotten it late). FINALLY the truth comes out!!! This lady deserves a huge raise for telling the TRUTH and actually giving me some kind of actual information for once So every time I check the status now and hear from a Best Buy employee or someone else that the phones aren\'t in yet, I\'ll be sure to tell them what is actually happening because either they were lied to by their supervisors or they are lying themselves. Still have no idea on when this mess will be sorted out (she said probably by September 10), but I at least finally think I know what is going on now. Best Buy should definitely hook us up for their massive screw-up and all of the torture and waiting we\'ve went through. I\'m even being billed for phones I don\'t have for almost a month now, and risk losing the Samsung Credit (the reason the deal was actually doable for me).

286,2019-09-04,"[""(copied from a previous post I made a few days ago, because I'm lazy) The first thing I noticed was the size of the tablet itsself, it's a lot smaller than I was expecting. The next thing was how much screen Samsung have managed to fit into such a small form factor. I've not had much time to really use it today, but as far as speed/performance go, it'll be right up there with the S/Note 10. I opted for the 256GB model with 8GB of storage, purely because it wasn't that much extra money in the grand scheme of things, and almost seems like good value (if anything can truly be 'good' value when it costs the better part of a grand. The screen is exactly what you'd expect, good colours, nice responsiveness (one thing which worried me was how responsive the pen would be when writing, as it's only a 60Hz display - thankfully it's great), it gets fairly bright, but I'm currently locked out of my house and typing this in the garden on an overcast day, and it's only just bright enough with almost no headroom left. I did notice while walking with it in my hand or tucked under my arm that becuase it's very dense it does get a bit tiring, and can be slightly cumbersome to carry for long distances. I'd recommend putting it into a bag or something. I'm typing this using the keyboard case and I've got say it's much more useable than I expected. The keys are the right sort of shape to hit one one by one (no accidentally pressing three at once) and the trackpad integration seems really god so far. I had a little play around with DeX while on the bus, so didn't really use it, but it's very easy to switch in and out of it. The cameras seemed a little pointless on paper, but having used them I can see the appeal of just snapping a shot of a piece of paper on your tablet and writing on it the S pen rather thah getting your phone out and having to bluetooth it to yourself. The images it takes are fairly low resolution, but they still look pretty good in all the other ways that matter - realistically, the sorts of people who think it's socially acceptable to take pictures on a tablet will buy something cheaper like a Tab A, or FireHD8. Finally, the feature that swung it for me and made me decide to actually buy this beatiful thing - the S pen. It's comfortable in the hand, if a little oddly shaped (you get used to it basically immediately), the magnetic charging is a really nice feature, and it was fully charged within minutes, and hasn't dipped much below 100% yet today. Drawing/writing is a smooth experience and feels really nice - the pressure sensitivity is really good and allows you very fine control over your 'brushstroke'. The case also hides the pen very nicely and holds it securely - I wish I'd realised the case had a large adhesive part before I shoddily applied it and had to peel it off (which took a lot of force, this thing isn't falling off any time soon). Minor issues: the backspace/delete key is in a slightly odd place, and the Fn+DeX combo uses the full reach of one hand for me (from C3 to D4 on a piano). Caps lock has randomly been on by default a few times. I had to spend a good half hour updating everything out of the box (not that this is unusual). I can't seem to change the two finger scroll direction on the trackpad. I've not had a great experience with the fingerprint scanner either - I might try adding the same thumb in landscape and portrait modes (face unlock has been damn-near instant, but you still have to swipe to open the tablet even after it's unlocked). I haven't had a chance to test the speakers or the video watching experiene as a whole, but honestly that's not somthing I'll be using this tablet for. It cost more than my laptop, and honestly I prefer this keyboard (despite the annoyingly small left shift key), it feels like the best 'netbook' ever created. The keyboard simply pulls off and you can use it as a standalone tablet (this is nice becuase the roughness of the back half of the case gives you something extra to grip - the metal feels premium, and I'd much rather have that than glass on a tablet, but it's very smooth.""]",0.033,0.7879999999999999,0.179,0.9990000000000001

This undercuts the value of the device since it is easy to figure out the ""suggested retail"" game where that is only really the price for really foolish people. 2) Most android phones either aren\'t that expensive to start or, well, come off as cheap. 3) Android is horribly fragmented and Android phones are not expected to be updated for five years. As a result, many (probably most) aren\'t designed to last that long. 4) Like them or not, Apple produces products that look premium, last longer, and will be updated for five years. Their marketing is also far more sophisticated (and effective). That gives them the image of premium in a sea of ""cheap"" devices. 5) Apple does not really discount it products in the same was any Android OEM. They offer discounts but they are within a formula and otherwise often do have people buying at sticker price. Microsoft does the same thing with Surface products. If you pay attention, you know the discount cycle. Between that cycle you pay the full price. Samsung seemed to be moving that direction but its discounts on S10s and Note 10s suggest they are simply going back to the Android approach with a higher starting price. As to how this works out in the real world, I sold my iPhone XR for more than I actually paid (had some credits so it was well under $500 and I sold it for $500 in only a few days. I also sold my Apple Watch for only $50 less than I paid last year. When I dumped the Xr (which I hated) and switched to a S10e, my actual cost was less than $100.

The camera is better but I think with how much Samsung puts in their phone I think the camera is always an after thought of other features added to their UI. I did use gcam for night mode and some portraits but now that night mode came out for the Note 9 I deleted it. One less app and it is really pretty good. I think the camera is much better since release and having dual aperture is great, but I think samsung is not using it's full potential. I think they are terrible at AI machine learning and should just let Google do this for them, drop bixby and stop this none sense.

435,2019-09-06,"[""Personally, before this launched I preferred the design of the Active Series 1 over the Galaxy Watch, but the lack of a rotating bezel was too much of a downgrade for me. This one having a haptic bezel is a great development, but not sure how it will affect battery life and durability in the long term. I think coming from the Huawei, any of the smaller variants (including the Active Series 1) would be too much of a downsize for you (unless you want that!) Either the Galaxy Watch 46mm or the Active Series 2 44mm would be great. The Active (pictured) is much more sleek, modern and lightweight, whilst being brighter and more vivid. But the GW is more durable and more traditional HOWEVER... There may be a _slight_ change of pace and/or learning curve when coming from Android WearOS to Samsung Tizen! You won't have the same app store or interface, and things like watch faces and preferences aren't transferrable. If you wanted to stick with WearOS, something like the Ticwatch or Fossil devices might be a better experience for you!""]",0.026000000000000002,0.773,0.2,0.9889

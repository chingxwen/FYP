Now I have a mortgage and other debts I can't afford to chop and change phones every 6 months anymore. The leaks for what the next iPhone will look like have put me off wanting one too, so there shouldn't be any temptation to go back this year either. Things are a lot better now with the software so I'm going to stick it out. App quality has improved too in recent years from what I've seen. Bit of a learning curve with all the extra things you can do with the phone settings, but worth the time to get the hang of it. The finger print scanner works about 98% of the time for me. Still waiting on the latest firmware update that apparently improves things. when it works I'd say it's on par with Face ID for unlock speed, maybe slightly behind, but you're not going to notice unless you're doing side by side comparisons. Still using my airpods and they work great, but I will be getting a set of the Samsung buds sometime soon. I used keychain for my passwords, and luckily I still have an iPad, and MacBook Pro, so I can access my passwords if I can't remember any.

My hope was to flash a firmware version that would work and not lock the boot loader. When it flashed correctly I was surprised. There was an exploit that lets you get to the contacts app from the emergency services during the wizard set up. I managed to use that method (without a sim card some how) and get to the contacts app. From there you can send messages (or try to) and send links to apps. If you go to a YouTube link it will open the YouTube app. Surprisingly in the terms and services section of the YouTube app you will open the terms in a web browser. If you have access to the web browser you have access to APK files. By default my firmware was only opening the Samsung Internet app. However luckily Firefox has an APK. Installing the Firefox APK gave me access to changing my default browser to none other than the Google Chrome browser from there I downloaded a third party apk app that was designed to give you the option to access any app on the phone without being on the Galaxy\'s main UI. So I went to the settings app cleared and turned off cloud storage syncing to the original account which no one including my buddy even knew about. I disabled Google Play services and added a brand new Google account and rebooted this made the install wizard just push on through thinking the new Google account was the admin account. Some issues I ran into: in order to access emergency calling you need a connection to towers unless that direct emergency call is to 911. Which I didn\'t want to make our 911 services freak out so I called and told them it was a test call and it was. Problem I had was that the phones sim tray was non existent. So a buddy lended me his tray and I used my personal Verizon sim. This actually caused my account to be locked as the device\'s IMEI was black listed. So I had to go to Verizon and have my account fixed. So this created the issue of ""if I try to do this again I can\'t use my personal sim so how will I access emergency services again? For some odd reason the phone let me do so without a SIM card. Here is where things get odd. Without the firmware version I got the phone actually would crash the wizard install app constantly. I got a tad discouraged thinking this meant that the phones current firmware version was designed to patch the exploit. So u actually reset the phone and for some reason it knew the Google account I added was there and the wizard install app decided to push on through to the ""add a Gmail account portion."" The next issue I had was it would read the Gmail but it wouldn\'t actually go anywhere. Instead it would say ""adding an account"" but just loop back around to add the account again. So once more I found myself stuck. That is when I decided to try all over again but this time with the older firmware version and entirely knew Gmail account. After a reboot and some hassle it just worked after reboot. Went on through no loops no crashing it just worked.']",0.08,0.871,0.049,-0.9584

I plugged it into my TV (a Samsung NU6900 55"" UHD TV) with an old HDMI cable that I dug out of a box in the garage, and went through the player\'s setup (which included a firmware update). At no point could I get any sound from the player -- I attempted playing several Blu-rays and a couple of DVDs, and while I could see the image just fine, there was no audio. Tried a CD too, and never heard anything. I fiddled with the player\'s audio settings (PCM vs. bitstream, etc.), but no sound. Tried the TV\'s HDMI 1 and HDMI 2 ports, power-cycled everything more than once, ran a factory reset on the player -- no dice. I plugged the player into a cheapo Element HDTV and had the same issue. I have not tried the player\'s optical out yet, mostly because I\'d prefer not to use it (and because I don\'t have an optical cable sitting around at the moment). More importantly, I\'m almost certain that I\'m using a 10-year-old HDMI cable, and I\'m almost positive that I don\'t have a newer high-speed / premium / 2.x HDMI cable handy. I\'m wondering whether this could be the issue -- that older cables just won\'t work with this model, even when attempting to play something as low-bandwidth as a DVD or CD. What are the odds that an HDMI 2.0 cable is all I need? Or did I just end up with an unrefurbed refurb?']",0.034,0.902,0.064,0.8272

438,2019-04-06,"['This is not actually the case, I wasn\'t buying ti because I was loyal, I bought it because I trusted them to be out for the customer. &amp;#x200B; Telling me its ok to build weak flimsy devices because its the customer\'s fault if it breaks is not ok. Case in point, the cracked screen is not entirely my fault, as it is a device made ridiculously -long- so as to not fit in any standard pocket and it can not be protected by most protectors as it has a rounded screen for no particular reason other than to ""hide"" the phone edges from most viewers who think 1-2mm of Bezel is somehow bad. Its a trick to make you think there is no bezel when there is, its just that the glass is rounded there to make you see a screen still only now you can accidentally click buttons while simply trying to hold your phone. &amp;#x200B; Accidents happen, Areyes. My S3 was my first device, and often I only had service when it was in one specific spot in the room and only there. I had to keep it in that one exact spot on top of the mini fridge to get signal at all out here and no there is no other service that would have worked out here at that time. It often got knocked down by the cat or even that time there was a minor earth quake shook the house just enough to knock it down. I used to be weaker than I am now due to health problems, had a weak grasp on things and sometimes the phone would slip. A time when I was out on my bike going through grass, I hit a bump and the strap broke throwing the phone to the ground. These are just examples of the accidents that happened to my S3 and it survived with NO DAMAGE because Samsung made a great device and I loved them for it. I was so happy with it I stuck with Samsung to get my next device. &amp;#x200B; On top of that the other potential devices cost hundreds more and weren\'t unlocked or compatible with the service I wanted to get. I found that I was able to get a discount on the S8 I was looking at, and could unlock it after a short time. When I got the device, I was a little disappointed because of how long it was, and the round screen edges, but at the time I didn\'t think they were terrible things. I bought a phone case for it, and found out that there are no reliable screen protectors for the device because of how the screen is designed, it is unprotectable to the primary way in which screens get cracked due to its round edge and 90% of screens were incompatible with the decent double layer cases. &amp;#x200B; It was only later on, months later, when I discovered that the battery can not be easily swapped. As if the phone was designed with a self destruct timer inside it because batteries are always the weakest component and are guaranteed to die within a year or two. Case in point, my battery has now expanded with enough force to push both the back panel off slightly, and make the screen of the phone dent forward in one spot. Now I must take the phone in to have a dangerous procedure done to repair it because Samsung has declared that I can\'t just walk in to a battery shop, pop the back off, plop the battery down on the table and say ""Hey, I need a new one of these"". A simple procedure for my old phone, you save no space GLUING the battery in, you don\'t get any added capacity, you don\'t protect the user any more with a GLUED IN BATTERY. There\'s no reason of any kind to GLUE a battery in. The fact that they glued the case on was enough to ensure the battery stays inside, and even then the internals show another support piece inside that also holds the battery in place. Why does Samsung feel the need to GLUE a battery in so that it can only be removed by exposing it to a dangerous situation like heating it up? Do they feel they need to make battery replacement so dangerous that it can kill people so as to prevent anyone from replacing their battery? Is it their goal to cause severe injury to anyone who tries to fix their own device? Whats the point of gluing a battery into a sealed device that already contains extra supports of its own for holding a battery inside a sealed confined space? The only reason I can think of, is what I listed above. To make battery replacement a dangerous complicated process that can severely injure people and destroy a device if you are unlucky or if you aren\'t a professional. &amp;#x200B; Furthermore, is it still my fault I had health issues causing me to be unable to hold onto my phone perfectly? As you said, I should treat my devices better. You assume that accidents don\'t happen with that statement. You also forgot to think maybe there is a reason other than negligence that I could have been dropping the device a lot. You just came at me as if its my fault for being careless. &amp;#x200B; Is Samsung -really- giving people what they want when everyone just goes out and buys a phone protector? Why do they think people want something, and then see everyone go out and undo the things they were given? E.G. Thinner phones are negated by phone protectors. Tool kits are released to help people replace irreplaceable batteries and open up these sealed devices that are ridiculously designed so as to ensure no one can repair it. Replacement batteries are STILL a thing even with the new irreplaceable batteries. Is Samsung going to start banning people who talk about device repair like Apple did to that professional who repairs Apple devices and recovers the data that Apple proclaimed to be impossible to recover? I don\'t think Samsung would be so petty as to do that, with everything being on record on the internet, and users like me who often screenshot everything and back up website posts on ""the wayback machine"" to prevent censorship. I doubt Samsung would start doing that, but I don\'t know, I\'ve started losing my faith in them.']",0.12300000000000001,0.804,0.073,-0.9945

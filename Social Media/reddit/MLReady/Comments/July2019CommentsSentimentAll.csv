255,2019-07-06,"[""**Should I get the Tab S4 now, or wait for the Tab S5 to release?** --- So I'm looking to get a tablet. A lot of people have said an iPad is the best buy at the moment, but in my case I don't think that's true. Firstly, the non-pro models have thick bezels, no USB-C ports, and too little storage. The pros are better, but no headphone jack, and no internal SD card slot, means I'd be forced to buy the 512GB or 1TB version, since I require a lot of space. Those are as expensive as high end laptops, at which point I'd prefer a laptop. Meanwhile the Tab S4 on the other hand, is actually under my original intended budget, looks the perfect size, has nice small bezels like the iPad Pros, comes with the pen, comes with proper bluetooth keyboard/mouse support, has a headphone jack, has microSD support.. Couple that with the fact I've owned a Samsung phone before and it had the nicest screen out of any phone I've bought before. Plus, I'm already an Android user, so it means I don't have to figure out alternatives for all the apps I've been using. So it seems like a no-brainer, but just now while reading about Linux on Dex, I noticed mention of a Tab S5 on the site, so I googled it, and some sites are suggesting the Tab S5 will be released next month, with the new Snapdragon 855 processor. This is tempting because while 95% of the stuff I want the tablet for probably isn't too resource intensive, I do like the idea of video editing on my tablet, and I think the extra performance would be seen there.

We get it, it sucks, the world is ending, blah blah blah. It was going to happen sooner or later. Just rip off the bandaid and move on. &amp;#x200B; As for the punchhole camera. What\'s different than the s10? Yeah it\'s in the middle, so what? People apparently still want a selfie camera and the tech to fit it under the display isn\'t mature enough to be made mainstream for atleast another 2 gens. &amp;#x200B; Regarding the removal of retina scanning, if you\'ve ever used it you know that it takes long and it sucks. Once samsung finds their version of Face ID everything will be good, but until then just use the fingerprint scanner or face unlock.

It might be a pre-order bonus but that\'s it. People are switching to wireless every day, look around, airpods are everywhere nowadays because it\'s conveniant.

407,2019-07-09,"[""I think the user tries to say, the performance expectation depends on the owner of the phone. I never play games on the phone, my usage mainly leans on videos, internet surf and social media. With that perspective buying a flagship phone just for this light resource usage is waste of money for me. In my opinion phone screens beyond 1080p resolution just marketing gimmicks. No matter how high quality they are, the viewing experience not even a notch of 4k monitors or 4k tv's. More battery consumption is a downside comes with that. A50 is able to record 4k 30fps with Opencamera app. Samsung's camera software not even in par with the camera hardware on the phone. The main 1080p 30fps setting comes with the phone records with 17 megapixels, not even using the full potential of 25mp camera. With the next update samsung gives ultra slow motion and night mod on their camera app. Indian market already got the update. I thing you got the ram and storage data wrong. A50 has 6gb ram and 128gb storage+ microsd option. The budget flagship s10e has the same ram and storage figures. You get more juice with the next steps of S family (duh!). Final words, if you don't use camera much (I took about 30 photos per year) and you don't play games on your phone the A50 worth the money but if photography is important to you, stay away from this phone. If you are a mobile gamer be aware, this phone doesn't perform awesome on ultra settings on most games but anything beside those, you'll pretty much get the same things you get on S series.""]",0.052000000000000005,0.9079999999999999,0.04,-0.5297

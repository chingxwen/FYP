2019-08-08,"['**Dear Samsung,** I just wanted to say how disappointed I am in you right now. I\'ve had every Galaxy S phone since the S4 (excluding S5), Note 3, and Note 7 (RIP) . I am currently using the S10 as my main phone. However, with this announcement, I don\'t anticipate buying any more Galaxy phones until you get your act together again. **1.** The headphone jack is one of those quality of life things that you don’t realize you miss until they take it away from you. In all fairness, you did keep it for 3 years after Apple ""courageously"" removed it from the iPhone 7 and Motorola removed it from the original moto Z. We all knew it was coming, since you released mid-range phones and some tablets missing the jack, and the leaks of the Note 10 weren\'t encouraging signs. With this change, you lose one of your differentiating features in the smartphone marketplace (only your compatriot LG seems to make flagship phones with headphone jacks these days). I don’t see why the headphone jack should be reserved for mid-range and low-end phones (i.e. Pixel 3a vs. Pixel 3), it should be included on every phone. Removing the headphone jack is a pointlessly user-hostile feature, especially to the creatives that you are marketing the phone to, who may want to use it with microphones and other accessories. When I\'m in a pinch, I can go to pretty much any store, and I\'ll usually find 3.5mm earphones for as low as $5. I have yet to see USB-C/Lightning earphones/adapters in stores. However, some stores are starting to carry wireless earphones in too, but I haven’t seen them less than $20. I don’t see USB-C or Lightning earphones becoming ubiquitous like that any time soon. I’m not saying that wireless headphones are bad. They’re awfully convenient and can sound decent if you get the right set. But there are still plenty of use cases for the headphone jack. Here’s what I use it for: * When my Bluetooth earphones die/I forget to charge them or when I want virtually *unlimited* battery life. You are trying to resolve the problem with Wireless PowerShare, but not all Bluetooth headphones support wireless charging yet. Even if they did support wireless charging, wouldn\'t it be an awful lot faster to just plug some headphones in? * At my university, there are a lot of Bluetooth devices in close proximity, so sometimes it gets congested and the audio will cut out. A wired connection resolves the problem. * On the last flight I went on, they told us to turn off Bluetooth devices. This means that I couldn’t listen to Bluetooth audio until they announced that you could turn on your Bluetooth devices again. Thankfully my S9+ had a headphone jack, so I could start listening to music right away, rather than listen to the person sitting next to me trying to initiate small-talk. * It might be a placebo, but whenever I use Bluetooth, my headphones sound quieter and less full sounding. When I plug the same headphones into the jack, they sound better and louder. * Bluetooth earbuds (especially truly wireless ones like your Galaxy Buds inside the charging case) are much more bulky than their wired counterparts. It’s so easy to just slip a pair of 3.5 mm earphones into your pocket and use them when I need them. * I mainly use Bluetooth audio in my car when I am by myself. But whenever I have friends or family in my car with me, I’ll use a wire so that we can “pass the AUX jack”. It’s a heck of a lot easier than trying to pair everyone’s phones and switch between them in the settings. **2.** I do like the color choices on the Note 10 line. They are much more visually appealing than your other phones. Other than that, design wise, smartphone aficionados like me can tell them apart, but I showed my mother the Huawei P30 Pro, iPhone XS Max, and Note 10 from the back, she couldn\'t tell much of a difference. I think the S10 range has a more unique design with the horizontal camera layout. I don\'t like the location of the Infinity-O cutout. I liked it better on the S10 line since it was out of the way in the corner. I\'d rather have a Infinity-U display than the current location of the punch-hole. **3.** The Note 10/10+ indicate that you are eschewing your ""kitchen-sink"" philosophy and heading in the footsteps of Apple. In other words, over-charging and under-delivering. The Note 9 was a truly zero compromises, Swiss Army Knife phone. I could name a feature, and it had it. The S10 family was along the same philosophy, although you did remove the Iris Scanner and Notification LED. However, the former was substituted with Face Recognition and the improved Fingerprint Scanner, and the latter can be added via software like the Always on Display, Edge Lighting or third party apps. Yes, the Note 9 may have started at $999, but the comparable iPhone (XS Max) started at $100 more and lacked many features that the Note 9 had (headphone jack, S-Pen, large battery, etc.). It also had half the storage of the Note 9 (64 vs. 128GB) and the screen on the iPhone was way dimmer and way less vivid. I like how you released two sizes of the Note 10 this year, but you should have either decreased the price of the smaller Note 10 and called it Note 10E or gave the smaller Note 10 a 1440p screen and a microSD slot. I think $799 - $849 is a fair price for the smaller Note 10 as it stands, but $949 for a phone with a 1080p screen and no microSD slot is crazy when your competitors\' phones and even your other phones have those features. In other words, if I was going to spend $949 on a new phone, I’d rather get the S10E and save a couple hundred bucks. $1,099 for the Note 10+ is ridiculous when the S10+ costs less and has a dual front camera system, unlike the Note 10 family. Lots of companies make Android phones. To sell yours, you must do things to differentiate your phones. Lower prices, better screens, unique designs, headphone jacks, expandable storage, faster performance, useful software features (not gimmicks), and actually listening to your customers are just some of the things you could do. Instead, you seem to be trying to fit in with the Apple\'s and Huawei\'s of the world. Raising prices and under-delivering will only decrease your profits even further, as fewer and fewer people will be willing to buy your phones, and will look elsewhere. I know I will be. **4.** Aside from the Note 10, releasing the Galaxy Watch Active in March and then releasing its successor a few months later is not cool, Samsung. &amp;#x200B; Sincerely, An Estranged Samsung Fan. &amp;#x200B; **TL;DR:** I am not a fan of removing the headphone jack, the Note 10’s cookie-cutter design, the abandonment of the “kitchen-sink” philosophy, and the release of the Galaxy Watch Active 2 after the Galaxy Watch Active was announced less than a year ago.']",0.04,0.85,0.11,0.9982

Don't get me wrong though, I'm a bit disappointed as well (just a teeny tiny bit) and would have preferred 1440p over 1080p even though I can't tell any difference. I know, I'm an illogical greedy human that wants larger numbers for absolutely no reason. The screen is the only let-down for me. I never used the headphone jack on my Note 9 because I have the Galaxy Buds and even though I have brand new Samsung SD Cards lying around at home, I never actually put them in my Note 9 because the base 256gb storage is more than enough for me. I mean, I guess not being able to get that sexy blue color on Note 10 is sort of a let down because let's be honest, that's one sexy color... I'm probably going to upgrade to Note 10 because the form factor of Note 10 compared to Note 9 is just sooooo much smaller due to industry leading screen to body ratio.

In the past year it got quite slow and even after changing battery it won\'t last me a full day. Also when using Spotify and simultaneously browsing the web it starts burning through my hand. The current and coming iPhones are not an option for me. The price is just ridiculously high for neither getting 5G or USB-C. When spending &gt;1k I plan on using the phone for at least 3-4 years (as with my current iPhone 6). I have had a look on almost every available phone (I think), and my favourites right now are the S10 and Note 10. The OnePlus 7 Pro is simply too big (and expensive, for not having wireless charging and IP certification). The Huawei software implementation seems to be sub-par. The remaining phones are the S10 (128GB, \\~630€) and the Note 10 (256GB, \\~800€). I kind of prefer the Notes design and got a slight bit of hope that the battery life will be a bit better through having the Exynos 9825 instead of 9820. I don\'t really care about the headphone jack as all of my headphones are bluetooth anyway. UFS 3.0 should be an advantage as well. I don\'t really need the stylus, but could see myself using it occasionally (I loved it on my Surface 3). In favor of the S10 is, of course, the lower price (altough lower memory).

They also claimed the the charging port, in this case lighting and type c, are better than the jack for audio. Now that the note 10 has been unveiled and we see that it no longer supports a jack, joining the ranks of many other jackless devices, are we at the point where it is no longer needed? I still whole heartedly believe bluetooth is not where it should be even though it has come along way. Just the minor annoyances of a small disconnect or battery dying is still super annoying. All that is solved by a simple connected wire, but limiting what can be connected to the phone is also frustrating.

2019-08-09,"[""I really like the idea of a smaller note 10 but every article that I read people and websites are kicking it down. Ignoring the head phone jack and SD card, as they don't matter for me, the other sticking factor is the screen resolution. Simply being a 1080 screen is not bad. If you put a screen with this resolution into a watch it'll be amazing (and overkill). You need to take into account the clarity of the screen and a good way of doing this is to measure the PPI or pixels per inch. Below is a list of different phones PPI so that you can see how it compares. Note 10 403. Note 10 + 498. Pixel 2 441. Pixel 2 XL 538. S10 550. S10E 438. S10+ 552. Note 9 519. Note 8 514. Note 7 409. iPhone 6, 7, 8 326. iPhone 6+, 7+, 8+ 401. iPhone X, XS, XS max 458. iPhone XR 326. Huawei P20 Pro 408. Huawei P30 Pro 398. One Plus 6 402. One Plus 6T 401. One Plus 7 402. One Plus 7 Pro 516. I understand that with the smaller battery Samsung probably went with a 1080 screen to save battery life. I currently have a pixel 2 and this means that my screen quality will get worse. On very rare occasions I look at my screen and feel a little disappointment but I also have a P20 work phone and I think that this screen is fantastic. Likewise we have iPhone 8s in the house and there is nothing wrong with these screens. I've decided that the screen is not an issue for me. The only other mystery for me to solve is if the UK version cones with a dual SIM... Some websites have said that it does and so did Samsung support when I messaged them but I'm still not sure.""]",0.04,0.845,0.115,0.9779

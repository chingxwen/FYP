2019-09-09,"['I\'ll start. -Software support: Honestly, with the newly announced list of phones that will get Android 10, there are some that are missing. Mainly S8, S8+ and Note 8. If Samsung wanted to give up the habit of ""2 Android updates only"", and actually not forget their older devices, now is the perfect time to do that. The S7 and S8 are different phones. S7 may not have been suitable for One UI, but we already know that S8 is for Android 10. The hardware can handle it (There are devices with the same hardware as S8 that are getting 10) and the design is almost the same as S9. One UI changed a lot of things, but Android 10 won\'t. I think Samsung should stary giving their flagships 3 updates instead of 2. I mean, the A8 started on Nougat and is getting the update, so I don\'t see the problem. A lotta people don\'t buy Samsung phones because of the software support. -Headphone jack: Well, it\'s a shame that it\'s gone on the Note 10. Kinda weird, since Samsung used to make fun of Apple for it. Well, I think Samsung still has time to go back. Remember the S6 days? They removed a lot of features, for no reason at all. And then, when things turned around, they changed them back with the S7. Samsung still can put the headphone jack on the S11. There are a lot of people who buy S10s instead of Note 10s because of the jack. We\'ll forgive you, Samsung. -Exynos extravaganza: I honestly do not understand why Samsung still makes 2 versions of their phones. Snapdragon definitely performs better in the long run. It\'s kinda weird how some regions have features that others don\'t just because of the chip. Samsung should just make 1 version of their phones, instead of 2. Do you agree? What would you add?']",0.045,0.833,0.122,0.9787

I am not looking for tech support. I am curious from your experience, would you trust Samsung to work this out with a software update? I found a very long thread on their forums with others from all networks having issues. The best they can do so far is tell people to update their software and clear the cache. Also, reset the networks, all of which I've done. They were saying that even the S10 had issues as well? Curious if those got worked out. I have until October 15th to return the phone to Best Buy.

If for some reason your Podcasts wont automatically transfer to your watch you can transfer them manually with the ""Add track"" option Thats it.

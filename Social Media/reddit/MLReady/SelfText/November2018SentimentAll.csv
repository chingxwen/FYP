I turn it on occasionally if I'm going to a new address or on a road trip, but not during my general everyday activities. I have the Samsung Pay app installed. Several months ago when I got the phone I set it up far enough to add a credit card that I never use. Really just kind of seeing what the app was all about and if it was something I could use. Obviously didn't want to put my debit card info on a new app I know nothing about. Anyway, after that, I have never used the app or even opened it. Never got a notification or anything.

I buy the game using a debit card not connected in anyway to Samsung pay or any other pay app on my phone. Don't even have the bank app but sometimes access my account on my phones browser. Literally as soon as I step out of the store I get a notification from Samsung pay with an offer to purchase a GameStop gift card at a 10% discount. Question is how did the app know I was there? Strictly through picking up my location through cell data? I did search GameStop on my browser about 6 hours earlier trying to figure out if I could search a stores used game inventory (I couldn't from what I could tell). Is the app crawling through my browsing history? Or did it just know my location through cell data? I also had a strange experience with the note 5 several months ago. I was texting a friend through the signal messaging app about his job at a mattress store. Just one text asking if he was still working there. I hadn't talked to him in a while and just making conversation. I never searched mattresses online or anything. Within an hour I had mattress ads all over my browser, chrome, and gmail on my PC. I do have chrome signed in and linked between my phone and PC. Signal is supposedly one of the most secure apps, so I'm guessing its the phone or Google.""]",0.033,0.914,0.053,0.9171

They\'ve gotten more firmware updates than any other monitor I\'ve ever seen in my life. The 27"" is currently on 1020.0 I think and the 32"" is on 1019.0 I think. I wouldn\'t get the 32"" version because it uses PWM (pulse width modulation) for some stupid reason which means it\'s not flicker-free. And flickering monitors cause me to get headaches when using them for long periods of time. There were so many issues with these monitors at release that I don\'t even know where to begin to list them. There are a lot of good and in depth reviews of them. The main issue that existed in my opinion was the lack of an adjustable ""overdrive"" setting for increasing the responsiveness of the pixels. This is something called pixel response time. If pixels are slow then there is a lot of blur during movement and high refresh rates become pointless because the pixels can\'t keep up with the high refresh rate and there\'s blur. Basically, every other gaming monitor brand has an adjustable overdrive setting. But the CHG70 didn\'t for some reason. When it launched, it seemed like the overdrive setting they were using was either too low/conservative or there was no overdrive being applied at all. Has this issue been fixed yet? I hope it has been because if this issue is fixed then it makes the CHG70 the overall best FreeSync monitor in the market. Note: In the Settings on the monitor OSD there was a setting called ""Pixel Response Time"" and had three options, Standard, Faster, and Fastest. Which is a very misleading thing to call it because it\'s actually not an ""Overdrive"" setting at all. It controls the backlight strobing. It\'s a black frame insertion feature. Standard is off. Faster is some strobing. And Fastest is a lot of strobing. This is not a replacement for Overdrive because this can\'t be used with 60Hz or FreeSync and it limits the backlight brightness level a lot. I don\'t think it can be used with HDR either.']",0.031,0.914,0.055,0.8888

64,2018-12-08 05:49:06,"['Apparently not many people have went into checking the Game Tuner app, so I thought I might share. If you go in there, you will see under each game a ""hardware performance limiter"" option. By default, if this is turned off, the phone will use the known ""recommended"" setting, which is basically throttling the hardware when gaming. For example, for Assassin\'s Creed Rebellion, the recommended hardware limit is at +3, however, you can raise hardware performance for games using this up to +5. Apparently this feature is there to limit performance in exchange for less heat production. However, for really heavy games, this also means you will not see the full potential of the phone and may lead to dropped frames or stuttering unless you lower the game graphics settings. Another feature you can toggle here is the resolution. You like to use your phone on full QHD for videos and pictures, but annoyed at the decreased game performance? You can set games here to use lower resolution. If your base resolution is at QHD, setting it to 50-60% is 1080p, and 25%-30% is 720p for that particular game. Alternatively, capping the FPS to something like 45 instead of 60 may also provide better smoothness if you don\'t want to lower the resolution.

Currently I\'m an iPhone user, (hand-down previous gen, never bought my smartphone on my own and when the time comes, I\'m going for Samsung for sure, but that\'s besides the point now...) So, I don\'t have much experience in online shopping in general, but I\'d love to buy the perfect gift for my niece who has this [Samsung phone]( It\'s [J2 Pro]( aka ""Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime Pro"" as far as I\'m concerned, and so far everything I saw online is either shady (probably different case will be delivered) or tacky. For instance, [this seems like the perfect case]( to get for her, however, besides the fact that it has just 1 image which looks shopped, it has no reviews, and ANYA\'s (the seller on amazon) other items mostly don\'t have reviews. One that has reviews, for instance, [this one]( it says that different case was delivered and that it was late on top of it all... so I\'m suspicious of ANYA\'s quality of business... Second best would be [this]( but similar thing here, no item reviews, and check out [this out]( somethings off right? I went to ebay too, which is basically diving head first into the unknown for me (never used it in my life, I\'m living outside US btw) [This]( seems like has the choice for Samsung Galaxy J2 Pro 2018 / Grand Prime Pro.... why both as different options? Could someone please let me know what would be the most secure way of getting a cute phone case that will be fit for model I need it to be fit for? I also snooped around on alibaba and found [this]( option, which has [what looks like the right model case for J2]( but no info in written form. Time of delivery is secondary, but still important. I hope someone can help me who has experience in online shopping. I hope you got the idea, Unicorns are best, cuter the better, the big ones are top choice if available (bigger than phone cases)... &amp;#x200B; Please put me on the right track if you can, and thank you for your time. &amp;#x200B;']",0.027,0.734,0.239,0.9984

149,2018-12-18 23:12:19,"['I have owned a top of the line Samsung washer and dryer set for less than 2 years and they have been the worst purchase I have ever made. To start; after purchasing we found out that our washer was impacted by the exploding top recall and had to wait 6-9 months for a decision as to what Samsung would do to resolve. They ended up offering to reinforce the top and extend the warranty by a year or replace with a different Samsung dryer (reimbursing the fair market value of the current machine which is total bullshit considering a customer had her jaw smashed open by a faulty washer). Since we did not want a mis-matched pair we opted for the fix. Before they were able to schedule an appointment our dryer stopped working. This was covered under warranty and took 2 service visits, over more than a week, to diagnose and replace the motor. After they repaired the dryer they came to fix the washer and-in truth-I haven’t had issues with it since. However, approximately 1 month after the warranty ended the dryer began squealing like a herd (pack, flock?) or pigs being molested by dirty ole farmer joe. I opted to repair myself to save some cash and had to replace all 4 drum rollers at the cost of $40 and 3 hours of my time. I have now done this procedure 3 times and every time I have to scrub the inside of the machine to removes the rust and rubber shavings that come from the bad rollers. Samsung has/had a reputation for quality but due to my experience I will never buy an appliance from them again. After tearing down this dryer 3 times I can tell you it is just a larger and more cheaply built clone of every dirt-cheap dryer on the market with a slick paint job and stainless steel front panel.

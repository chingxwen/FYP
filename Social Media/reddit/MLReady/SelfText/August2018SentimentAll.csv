Going from the iPhone 6 to the S9+ is quite a step change in terms of well everything.. The screen for example makes the old iPhone 6 look like a Gameboy colour! But one of the other big differences is the sheer size of the thing. I like to use devices one handed, like when eating it’s good to be able to feed and do stuff on your phone at the same time. But although my hands are big enough to hold the S9+ in one hand and browse the net the issue is going back and forward on web pages. On iOS you can swipe right anywhere on the screen and it’ll take you back a page. On Android no such feature seems to exist by default. I’ve downloaded a few gesture apps but they seem to have the gesture bars towards the bottom end of the phone which is the hardest place to get to using one hand... So does anyone know if there is an app that allows you to use gestures on the full height of the phone or even a good portion of the middle as that would be a decent compromise?

From searching around it seems this issue has something to do with Sprint being the phones original provider (I live in Canada and am currently under Rogers).

Right now it is leaning towards the Galaxy S9 Plus the most, as it seems to be packing the most features, a pretty decent battery life, and a great camera. The Huawei P20 Pro definitely gets better battery life which I am aware of, but it lacks quite some features I\'d like to see, which Samsung has. Either way, those of you with either the S9 or the S9 Plus, how would you say your phone manages during an ""average"" day? Battery life is the one thing I\'ve always had issues with on every phone I have owned, except my latest iPhone 8 Plus, but even that one is starting to disappoint me lately. I\'m by no means a super power user, but I do Snapchat quite a lot (which I know takes a lot of battery), but other than that I guess I spend most of my time on Reddit, or just playing around with the phone, nothing too intense. I also listen to music, check social media and stream stuff from time to time. If I have a slow day I\'ll probably do some gaming every now and then.

62,2018-08-08 23:22:05,"[""I'm a video creator and I use the new 1080p 240fps slow motion camera mode a lot in my videos. I recently discovered that my videos were getting a lot of stuttering and lag and even freezing when trying to record. After a lot of digging, and not a lot to go on from the internet, I think I've pinpointed the issue. I purchased my S9+ through T-Mobile about a month ago upgrading from a Google Pixel. I was mostly after the enhanced camera modes such as 4k (60fps), super slow motion (960fps), and 1080p slow motion (240fps). It worked great for the first few weeks and then one day the 240fps mode started recording very choppy, stuttery video and would even freeze or crash on hitting record. At first I thought it was the new SD card I started using, but removing that didn't fix it. Then I tried the usual troubleshooting tactics such as deleting the camera app cache and data. I even went as far as factory resetting the phone. Nothing worked. I finally contacted Tmobile and they sent me a free replacement thinking it was hardware related. Yesterday I picked up my new phone and, voila, it worked. Smooth 240fps video once again. Then last night, my phone auto-updated to latest firmware and once again, I'm stuck with stuttery, laggy 240fps slow motion video. So I had my friend who also has a S9+ through Tmobile test his, and he had the same issue. He is also updated to the latest version of firmware. At this point I knew it was firmware related, so I dug deeper. I contacted Tmobile again and they suggested I contact Samsung. Samsung stated they hadn't heard about this issue and escalated it to their dev team. I'm assuming since the mode isn't enabled on the camera by default that not a lot of people have experienced this issue. Combined with the fact that a lot of people in general don't use slow motion modes. I then had another friend with a S9+ but through AT&amp;T test his and it worked perfectly. After looking at his Baseband version and comparing it to mine, it is the stock version of firmware that ships with the phone and it seems AT&amp;T is further behind on updates than T-Mobile is. TLDR: Don't upgrade to Baseband version G960USQU2ARF7 if you want 240fps camera mode to work smoothly. This is the July 8th update and is the latest update for T-Mobile and hasn't been released for AT&amp;T I'm 99% sure this is the issue and Samsung needs to know about it. If anyone else has a S9 or S9+ through T-Mobile and is updated to the latest firmware feel free to comment and confirm that your 240fps slow motion video is also choppy or stuttering. And if you haven't updated, let me know if your video is smooth or not! I kinda hope I'm wrong and am just unlucky with TWO phones.

However, Samsung\'s rich feature set is what initially got me into the Android ecosystem. I am a tad obsessed with phones. Last year, I bought a S8+ coming from a Nexus 6P. I enjoyed the phone, the battery was fantastic and I liked all the features. I\'ve always loved the Note line, and I toy with buying one each year. However, I gave the S8+ away and got a Pixel XL 2 because of the camera. However, the main difference here is not the back camera. Although, I believe the Pixel\'s camera to be superior, I feel all back cameras from major OEMs (Google, Samsung, Apple), are all highly serviceable. However, what sets the camera discussion a part is the front facing camera. I personally believe that the Front Facing Camera on Samsung devices are downright putrid. I have no idea why they continue to keep the awful face smoothing feature with phones in the west. I gave the S8+ away because the Pixel 2XL front facing portrait mode was insane to see when I was looking at such an awful front facing camera everytime I used it. Now, I am not some self-absorbed individual who needs to take glamour shots. I truly believe the ""selfie"" cam should be viewed as an extension of the camera experience for any phone. It\'s just a way of taking pictures in the today\'s world that is easier sometimes. What I am curious about is have they made any upgrades with the Note 9? I totally buy into the package of creating a truly ultimate phone, which I believe Samsung is very close with here. However, no reviewer or online publication has discussed this.

After taking it off the charger, at 98%, it dropped to 87% within an hour with me hardly even checking the time. Once it reached 70% it stopped dropping so rapidly. I also took some pictures and when I went to look at them in the gallery a few of them looked corrupted, but upon opening and sharing them with others they were not corrupted (but still appeared this way in the gallery) Worth mentioning is that I've had some problems with fast charging over the past week or so in an outlet and with a cable that I've never had problems with before. Even after fiddling with everything nothing made it fast charge. I Have optimized the phone in settings, turned on power saver mode, closed all apps, etc but nothing seems to help.

I\'ve tried different browsers, different devices, different times of day (night) and I keep running into the same block. A few days ago I was about to pull the trigger on it and made it all the way to the checkout screen but I got pulled away. Now, when I try to do it, it won\'t work.

Epic Games, maker of Fortnite has teamed up with Samsung so that anyone who pre-orders the new devices from Samsung will receive a free skin, and its only one skin per device, so if someone claims it, nobody else on that device can. Look, if you want to claim the skin for yourself, ho ahead. But if you know you’re not going to play Fortnite on your device and you won’t claim this skin, you have come to the right place. PM me if you’re interested. We’ll settle everything there, including my account details, help on getting the app, and the compensation I mentioned earlier (not saying anything about it here because there is a no selling rule here and I don’t wanna break that rule and get this post removed).

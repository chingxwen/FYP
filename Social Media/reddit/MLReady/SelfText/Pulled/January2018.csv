7naapn,"I got an update to my phone last week so I updated it (No I don't use the phone during the update time, I simply connect it to the wall so it has constant power and let it do it's thing (Phone at 55% before update))

It's almost like the phone is bricked now, If I open a Youtube video phone freezes, I open imgur the phone freezes. Whatever I do in the phone it just freezes.

I can open webbrowser and surf, that works. But nothing else.

7nbnxp,"So I got the Note 8 directly from Samsung with the $400 trade in for a note 5 promotion. I needed to ship the note 5 by today (Sunday), but instead I dropped it off on Friday.

The problem is that Samsung says they haven't received notification from FedEx that the package was shipped. (I confirmed this using the tracking number too). It turns out that I foolishly dropped it off in the drop box outside the shipping center (apparently a no no) . I have no way of retrieving it as they are closed today and tomorrow.

If this was Apple or Amazon, I wouldn't be too worried as I may get some leniency from a representative. However, I fear Samsung will have no mercy and keep my trade in and charge me the 400.

I hope someone can help, Samsung customer support was painful!

The issue that occurs is a 15-30 second sound loop (so whatever was last played, I.E ""You shall not pass!""), followed by the bar powering down. During this time manually trying to turn off the bar will do nothing, it will just prompt the bar to say BYE but the issue will still persist.

It probably does this every 3 hours or so, so it's not the worst but it is rather irritating, if anyone has encountered this and has a fix that would be great!

First RMA of the AKG Earbuds - Sent out 7/1/17 Arrived Back Fine

Second RMA of the AKG Earbuds - Sent out 8/27/17 Arrived Back Fine

Third RMA of the AKG Earbuds - Sent out 10/11/2017 Arrived Back.....

EARLY SEPTEMBER: it wasnt the AKG Earbuds it was a USB Type-C cable and brick. so WTF i called them back that day ""sorry for the mistake keep the Type-C cable and a pair of AKG's will be on there way"" ok sweet....

EARLY OCTOBER: here i am at my hotel and i decided to call Samsung to call what the hell is up with my AKG earbuds, i was on the phone for 40 minutes being switched back and forth to different people and there like ok sorry we didnt send them out we will send then out now, ok sweet......

MID NOVEMBER: pretty much same story in October, called them and they said they will send them out ASAP.....

I didnt call all of December because at this point i was too pissed off to even call them a 6th time and listen to that horrible waiting music

TODAY 1/3/18: I decided to call them back told them this whole story, ok fine we will send you out a pair and youll get a email of the shipping number, Ill update this thread if i even get that email. 

REVIEW: I do like the sound and quality of the AKG earbuds the S8 comes with its just a bummer that the audio keeps dying on the left side, there are alot of threads talking about the issue on /r/GalaxyS8 just look up AKG and scroll through. I dont know what ill do with the pair of AKG's that are at some point hopefully gonna arrive to me, I wish i could've gotten a equivalent accessory since they are 100$ on the Samsung Store site.

7nzpor,"Question: Has anyone else gone through something similar with Samsung's Warranty Repair?

So I have been going back and forth with Samsung's support for three weeks now. My phone was melting from the inside and when I contacted Samsung they told me to send the phone in as it was still covered under the one year warranty.

I was told that the phone would be repaired in 3-5 business days then they would ship it back. I sent my phone to Samsung's McAllen, TX repair center on December 8th and they received it December 12th. A ticket number was created for this repair. Then, without warning, they cancelled my ticket number without letting me know. When I contacted them about the cancellation they told me the reason for the cancellation was that they had to send the phone to a different repair location. I was told to wait some more time while the repair was processed.

After waiting for 5 business days, I contacted them again for an update. I called three different days and each time the person on the phone would transfer me, or tell me that they had no idea what was going on with my phone and that I should just wait. I was starting to get impatient as the days passed. I was going on 10 business days with no update.

I finally called again and I was finally given another clue to the whereabouts of my phone. Apparently, a new ticket number was created when the phone was sent to the different repair center located in Plano, TX. I was not given the new ticket number this whole time. I asked about the new ticket number and all I was told was that the new repair center could not be contacted by phone and that I would have to wait even more.

It has now been *15 business days since they have had my phone. I called and chatted with Samsung Support several times in the past two weeks and every single customer support agent that I contacted has told me to talk to someone else or to wait more time. I still haven't heard received an update and I feel like I have been given the runaround by everyone I've spoken to at Samsung. I understand it takes time to repair the phone but leaving me in the dark about the status of my phone is not right. It has been a frustrating few weeks.",samsung,2018-01-03 18:06:15

In trying to cancel it, I was informed that the Live Chat isn‚Äôt actually in the Premium Care department, despite it being advertised as so. Twitter isn‚Äôt able to help me.

I called customer support and was told a shipping label would be e-mailed to me to return the phone and receive a new one. After 2 weeks I called again as I had not received a return label. I was told to wait another 7 business days. After another 2 weeks and still no label sent, I cancelled my order through my Samsung account and returned the phone with the labels that were sent for the cancellation. The phone was sent back to me saying the return was rejected. 

So I called customer service again and had them explicitly make a note in my account saying the phone was being returned in a damaged state because that is how it was sent to me and to accept the return. I was sent new return labels and sent the phone back again in mid-December.

Just today I received a credit notice about a delinquent account from Samsung. So not only has Samsung made returning this phone nearly impossible for over 2 months, but now they are messing up my credit score.

It has one major flaw which is very low internal memory. I often run out of storage. I would like to root the device so I remove all bloat AND be able to move some of these apps to the SD card (the one's that can't be done without root)

My bacground:

I went from Galaxy Nexus, to Nexus 4 to Note 4 to Pixel XL. Have also owned the original Nexus 7. However, I have never rooted a device nor have I ever attempted to do so.

Hear nothing, call multiple times through Dec, each time told I should get my exchange 7-10 business days. Hear nothing, call Jan 4th, and told that warehouse should ship in 7-10 business days. 

So 2 months later, my Chromebook is no where to be seen, and basically in limbo. I can't get a straight answer from anyone over at Samsung. They all say the same jibberish which is 7-10 business days. Is this the modus operandi for dealing with customer returns at Samsung? 

Anyone have suggestions on how to escalate through Samsung? Is there some corporate VP or someone that I can talk with? 

thanks! ",samsung,2018-01-04 12:56:38

7o7sdu,"I've bought this monitor a few months ago and adored the 3D feature. I used it to play Wii games in 3D, which was a great experience. 

One day the CR2016 battery in the glasses ran out so I took a little break from it and didn't get another battery until just a couple weeks ago. When I did, I noticed that the glasses no longer displayed 3D graphics when paired with the monitor: the monitor would show ""3D glasses connected to monitor"" but the glasses would not show anything in 3D, and seemed like they just immediately shut off right after connecting. I've bought 2 different brands of CR2016 batteries (5 batteries total) and a couple Energizer CR2025 batteries. None worked.

I've live chatted with Samsung, who told me to call Microsoft. I called Microsoft, who told me to call Samsung. I called Samsung, who finally told me to go to a certain brick and mortar store located very far away, so that I may test my glasses on the monitors there.

Seeing as neither company is able to help me, I thought I'd post here: what is wrong with my monitor/glasses, and what can I do to fix them? They clearly connect, but they don't seem to maintain a connection. Any help would be appreciated.",samsung,2018-01-04 17:45:54

2. Unpaired the phone from the soundbar. Since then, the soundbar has not appeared in the phone's list of available devices when searching for a Bluetooth device.

First question: Verizon has sent me a new phone (probably refurbished, tbh) and now I'm wondering how I go about guaranteeing that there's no personal info/media on there before sending it back. I've heard some horror stories of old photos, personal messages, etc. being left on a device and then given to another customer after refurbishing. 

Assuming I can actually see things well enough to get to the factory reset option, will that actually remove data or just make it ""invisible""? Is there anything else I can do instead of or in addition to that?

Second question:  Since I can't see the screen well enough to get into the play store and download an app for data transfer, I was going to use the Samsung Smart Switch transfer on the PC.

7p1igm,"Edit: ""freezing/going unresponsive*"" don't know where that word disappeared to!  

First happened at the start of last week; I spend a lot of time listening to podcasts at work and one stuttered a few times (""paused"" then continued maybe 3 or 4 times), then the phone became unresponsive, wouldn't unlock, couldn't pause, wouldn't just turn off/on or swipe, so as I was driving I chalked it up to a cheap stereo bluetooth and changed to radio.  

Phone still wasn't responsive so I hard-reset it (vol down and off), it turned back on and was fine. Happened again while driving at the end of the week once, but not for a few days, and not over the weekend in general use.  

Then yesterday it happened once, and today twice, but these times were not connected to bluetooth, phone in pocket, so i noticed how hot the phone was running. Never had it running that hot while just listening to podcasts before (Using podcast addict if that makes any difference), and there seems to be now obvious logic behind it. Used the device management tool to close all the apps/background apps after the first reset, then  it happened again within the hour, but this was after at least 3 hours of podcasts. Yesterday it probably lasted about 6 hours before freezing.  

As such, I have no idea how to troubleshoot, the general advice seems to be safe mode, but if it could take 4 or 5 hours (or more) before a crash then i'll likely a) forget and use multiple apps anyway, b) just restart the thing anyway, or c) still not know how to test if it was the app or just some other process causing the issue.

7pasfh,"I don't know where else on Reddit to post this, so I guess here will do.

I recently sent in my phone for repair under warranty due to it *smoking* during charging. Only happened once, but once was enough to turn off the phone, take out the sim, and start using an old phone. I contact their chat service, which claims, based on my IMEI, that it's still in warranty and they'll have a look at it. I get my shipping label send it in, and they receive it.

Now today, shortly after they receive the phone, I get an email claiming the phone is out of warranty and I'm going to be charged for the repair. So someone's got it wrong, obviously, but I expect the phone to be in warranty as their own representative claimed it was at the very beginning of the issue.

So I decide to get to the bottom of it and contact support. After being bounced around to a couple different chat reps, I get bounced to the phone service. Who then bounces me to the service center, which claims the phone is no longer in warranty. After discussing the issue with a guy at the service center for a few moments, during which he seems to not be able to grasp the concept of ""hey, you guys told me it was in warranty, please fix it without charging me"", I get pissed off, chew the guy out a bit, and he ends the call. 

So, my temper aside, it seems that Samsung has no way of being able to accurately know if a phone is in warranty or not, and they don't seem to be able to communicate with each other at a basic level. Frankly, all they had to do in this case for this to be an open and shut, super positive experience was to say, ""Oh hey, we're sorry your phone is **smoking when you plug it in**, we'll get that charging port repaired and sent to you right away. We'll honor our representative's initial warranty claim and get that shipped out tomorrow.""

But no.

What a sad excuse for support over what is, essentially, $50 maximum for their parts and time. And ethically, is it right for a business to turn around and contradict their own agents, then charge me for repairs? I don't think so. What scummy behavior. Samsung should be ashamed of how they're handling their support.


**EDIT:** Received a response from yet another tier one rep on Twitter who only reinforced their stance that they think it's out of warranty. They've yet to tell me why the original rep marked it as within warranty, or admit to their mistake.

""Hello A--w, I apologize for the late response. Your patience is appreciated. I am terribly sorry to hear that. I was able to view the ticket number you provided and the IMEI for the S7 Edge shows it is out of warranty by date on 12/12/2017. The service order was created 12/30/2017. We honor our warranty for up to a year from the date of purchase as long as there is no physical or liquid damage to the phone. As of now, the ticket is pending on hold for standard charge. I understand you initially sent your device in for service, however the device was out of warranty, once it gets to the service center it is then evaluated and a standard charge has to be placed to proceed with repairing the phone. My apologies for any confusion this has caused. Please let me know if I can offer additional information. Thanks.""

And here's the thing. I bought this phone in October of 2016, so even if it was a 12 month warranty, it should have been out of warranty in October 2017, not two months later. So, not only can they not adhere to what their reps originally state to their customers, they apparently cannot figure out how long a year is, or when the warranty period for my phone began.

7prjb5,"2 Disclaimers, 1) This is coming very much off the cuff, I haven't read the rules of this subreddit yet and I haven't taken time to compose my thoughts, so i'll add a tldr down below. 2) I don't hate samsung. I like them. For years they've been the only android contender against apple, and I very much like their current lineup. They may even be the best smartphones on the market right now. 

That said. 

I think samsung is holding the android platform back. Whenever I see a video or article talking about the iPhone, they refer to the apple ecosystem being the thing that makes apple the best. But in reality, google has perhaps the most robust digital ecosystem of all time. I probably use 10 google services a day. 

Chrome, Youtube, Gmail, Google play books, google play music, google sheets, google docs, google photos etc etc etc. With the exception of maybe microsoft, google has the most items in its ecosystem than any other platform, but what sets it apart is that I use them all. I use hangouts, i use allo, i use duo. My phone is a nexus, my smart device is a google home mini. 

But google isn't perfect. Where they fall apart are a few small areas. Messaging is fragmented. Allo vs android messenger? Wtf is hangouts? Duo is its own app? Why not put everything into the same messenger? 

Here's why. Unlike imessage that SWITCHES from sms to data for certain features, google has put its money in the RCS basket. If you're unawares, RichChatService is a universal platform that uses a NEW sms standard that can send high resolution images, seemless group messaging, read receipts etc etc etc. 

how samsung is making this system fail. 

While samsung phones might be the best ones out there (some like the pixel better but i know i'm on the samsung sub so i'll just concede that for now), but they are hurting the long game. 

Nobody is going to use bixby in 10 years. nobody is going to use samsung's messenger plus in 10 years, nobody is going to use any of their proprietary elements. Nobody uses samsung for their skin. 

So for that reason, i think samsung and google would be better off if they just had their own OS. Every other android partner is playing ball. they all agreed to use android messenger instead of their own messaging app. they all are trying to use the new api that google has started that lets android versions roll out faster to third party developers. 

Samsung doesn't want google daydream or android wear. they want their own ecosystem so let them have it?

Because it seems there are ANDROID fans... then there's samsung fans. Maybe we should break up

TLDR samsung doesn't want to play ball with android and google. So why not just make a samsung OS? ",samsung,2018-01-11 13:38:02

My girlfriend recently got a new phone. In the process of getting the sim tray out of her old phone (S6 Edge), it snapped, and left a corner piece still in there. We attempted to put the sim tray back in with a sim to see if it worked and the sim is lodged now.

Apparently the sim can be pulled out with a little effort, but does anyone have experience with the broken piece of tray? Ideally we want to replace the tray (as it will only cost about ¬£3 for a replacement tray off eBay) and sell it on. Otherwise will go for a repair and see how much that offsets the sellon price (¬£100-200).

Has anyone had this happen or do you know where they restored too?",samsung,2018-01-13 18:54:07
7q9b12,"So I got a 65KU6290 that has 3 HDMI ports

* Port 1: HDMI 2.0 + HDR compatible: PS4 Pro Plugged
* Port 2: HDMI 2.0 but not HDR compatible: PC with GTX 980 plugged
* Port 3: HDMI 2.0 but not HDR compatible: ARC Sound Bar with HDMI 1080P input only

&amp;nbsp;

Being fed up switching HDMI 1 and 2 to play HDR games on my PC and Since Samsung is virtually limiting inputs and features on lower end models to force people into buying more expensive TV sets, instead I purchased an external [three ports HDMI 2.0 switch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0742BBZQ3) (HDCP and HDR compatible with RGB and YUV422 all @ 60Hz) for $20 (advertised on Amazon as being fully compatible)

&amp;nbsp;

When connecting it, I would get picture only when HDR was off on the TV. 

&amp;nbsp;

Having HDR on, would prevent display on the TV, sometimes picture would be randomly impacted by white artefacts all over the screen flickering, or picture and sound cutting off: unusable

&amp;nbsp;

I tested that switch with all the HDMI cables that I have in my house (more than 10, old and new), all possible combinations, and each time I get the same: cannot use the switch at 4K@60Hz with HDR.

&amp;nbsp;

So, I blame the price of the previous switch and purchase a way more expensive switch ([Vorke 41 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/VORKE-HDMI-Switch-4kx2k-60Hz/dp/B075NX931W) for $59). 

&amp;nbsp;

SAME RESULTS with both HDMI switches on my Samsung TV... picture and sound cutting off, artefacts, no picture displayed for several seconds...

&amp;nbsp;

So since that drove me completely MAD ... I plugged the switch (the above Vorke 41) on my Sony 4K tv 60XE690E just to try it out, I needed to understand the why...

What was my surprise to see that **the HDMI switch is working PER-FECT-LY on the Sony TV**. Even with the worst/oldest HDMI cable, it works on the SONY... WTF Samsung???

&amp;nbsp;

So, after that test, it is obvious that my Samsung TV has a problem, but without the switch, there is no problem, just I'm fed up with switching inputs myself


Is this a voluntary limitation on my Samsung TV?

Is Samsung making sure, through firmware, that you can't get several 4K@60Hz withHDR sources connected to your TV, because we should have spent more money on a pricier TV

 &amp;nbsp;

7qub7l,"Okay before everyone starts with the fanboy comments and making any kind of a judgement, hear me out as I need to vent.

I'm a NYC based photographer and computer engineer. I've adopted and praised android for their OS since my first G1 purchase out of High School. Since studying both arts and computer engineering in college I moved on to Apple mainly because of its superior camera, and almost every year I watched the camera get better while their counterparts suffered immensely with the lack of quality. Soon after the reveal of the iPhone X and ""8"" I said to myself that I no longer trusted Apple because of its incoherent ability to advance and give their consumers something that is physically and internally inferior to anything else on the market. 

With that said, after watching that depressing keynote with its ""Animoji"" as a highlighted feature I walked out of my office and went to my nearest shop to switch for a Note8. I fell in love again. With it's beautiful and lengthy screen, ability to write notes with a stylus and sleek design I just had that feeling of excitement again. Months later, the feelings are still there. The transition was difficult at first (I had every iPhone since the 3GS) but everything was second nature after a few weeks. Although some forced notifications were very annoying (wi-fi calling, touch input) but I just got used to it.

Coming off of the iPhone 7 - everything was different but in a good way EXCEPT for the camera. From a photographers perspective, the camera on the iPhone 7 was much better than anything else on the market at that time but from a tech perspective on paper the Note8 SHOULD have been ahead but it wasn't. I've noticed while on my recent trip to Japan that I would heavily rely on my Fujifilm XT2 rather than my phone which was the complete opposite when I used to run around with a full frame camera and an iPhone. This was entirely seen in person as I watched my friends walk around taking pictures with their iPhones even when they had their cameras strapped around their neck. As much as I would love to continue on with a Samsung device which I had planned to with the S9 in the rear-view mirror, I can't help but to think that Apple's camera is far ahead of its time and probably will be unless Samsung figures out a better way to implement better image processing and sensors which I have no doubt think that they have the ability to do so. 

I believe Samsung should invest a lot more into this, even with all the other great things that they've done elsewhere and the innovations that we've seen among all other companies like HTC, Huwaii and Google, I feel that the perfect phone is still in the hands of Apple. Their camera alone gives them an advantage over the market, because at the end of the day I learned that I would rather be in awe of the beautiful details when documenting the precious moments of my life than complain about their failure to innovate and I know many of you would think the same. I've always said that the best camera is the one that's always with you, but unfortunately this doesn't apply to me anymore.",samsung,2018-01-16 10:22:32

You can swap out the battery in the old days, and not even getting a new battery helps with battery life. So I told myself I will never get another Samsung device again.

About 6 months ago, I got myself a Xiaomi Mi Max for around $250. I am genuinely impressed by the battery life and the performance. The phone feels snappy, only lags on me when I am using multiple apps and once. SOT is around 6 hours. The only problem is that I don't get LTE service in the state, and the voice calling is horrible in a crowded area. (I live in NYC)

I am planning to pre-order a Huawei Mate 10 Pro on February 4th due to its all rounded reviews on its performance and battery life. However, I am hearing many horror stories how lack of customer service in the state, how Huawei doesn't honor its warranty, and the lack of software updates on Mate 9. 

I am considering getting my hands on the Matw 10 Pro and test drive it for a few days until the S9 is announced. I am considering jumping over to S9 if the Mate 10 doesn't live up to my standard.

I'm wondering how long do Samsung devices usually last nowadays? Will the performance drop within a year and the SOT cut by half within two years? Really doubting myself whether I should go back to Samsung

I immediately called Samsung to have them recall the package, but they cant help me.  So I call fedex to have them return the package to Samsung.  Samsung wouldnt help me with this issue, and Fedex told me that Samsung has to call to request to get the package back.

Then I order a new Samsung Note 8 Unlocked with the new headphones, and paid for upgraded shipping.... but the item hasnt been shipped, and they told me it can be up to 3-5 days after you order the item....  Why do I pay for upgraded shipping when the item wont be to by end of week?  Plus I ordered the phone way early on a Wed AM

The email i used for my samsung account was a school email that but after you leave that school they deactivate the email account. So if i try to reset the password i can't access the email to change the password so it's just a big mess. I was wondering if there's anyway to reset the samsung account on the phone.

7rdu1i,"Some months ago I decided to buy a Samsung Galaxy A7 2017, returning to this manufacturer after trying others in the recent years, like Motorola, Sony etc. And, unfortunately, the opinion I had years ago regarding Samsung Android smartphones is still valid: while the hardware is great, they SUCK big time regarding OS updates. My device is still with the August 2017 security patch! Unacceptable for a recently released phone.

From what I see following sites like SamMobile and XDA, Android updates in general is still a complete mess, with the only exceptions being Google devices (Pixel, Nexus). But Samsung in particular is doing a WORSE job than other manufacturers: their update policy is heavily fragmented, some devices (even older/inferior ones) get updates quickly, while others almost never see an update. And then, suddenly, the frequently updated devices may not get an update anymore at all, while the others start getting something more regularly.

For the A7 2017, for instance, I see some countries got the December 2017 update. For my country, though, only one carrier got it -- which is weird: why the unbranded version didn't get it first?

Will we EVER see timely updates (at least SECURITY updates) for our devices, in a consistent manner?",samsung,2018-01-18 15:06:09

7sicu1,"Hi ‚Äî

A few weeks ago I started having awful issues with my Samsung TV staying connected to the wireless network.

When I load up Netflix I get about 10-15minutes of episode time, then it‚Äôs a disconnect. The only way to get myself back online is to to the following steps:  
exit Netflix  
attempt to load up Hulu  
trouble shoot the network  (after getting a network error)
switch to my 2ghz connection  
go back to Hulu to get an immediate disconnect  
Repeat the trouble shoot error  
Now it will let me reconnect to my 5ghz connection  

From this point I will get about 10-15 minutes of show time again before I have to repeat the above process.  

In the house we have 2 iPhones, 2 gaming consoles and 1 PC all connected to WiFi, none of which have issues with internet or Netflix. The router is about 15 feet away from the tv with no walls or large objects blocking the signal. 

I‚Äôm at a complete loss here as to what to do. I‚Äôve attempted keeping the tv unplugged for 10+ minutes to soft reset it, I have reset factory defaults, tried moving the router closer and further away, tried on unsecured connections, it‚Äôs always the same problem.  

If anyone has any tricks or solutions, I‚Äôd love to hear something. It‚Äôs really frustrating trying to watch a show at night only to spend more time trying to connect to the internet, rather than watching the episode.. lol

7sj7eb,"I have had one of these since day 1 of owning the phone, no front screen cover used.

After a month of heavy use where the device resides face up only my desk or in my pocket, the front of my phone has only picked up a couple of light scratches that can only be seen in certain angles of light. However, the back is heavily scratched/scuffed on the top and bottom areas by what can only be assumed to be rogue dust entering the case.

As it is the back of the phone, I'm not too fussed since I intend to use this case for the life of the device but for anyone hoping this case was snug and rugged enough to save the back of your phone from any cosmetic damage, don't be mistaken.",samsung,2018-01-23 16:33:04

Do we think they might one day return to flat displays as an option?  The s9 plus or note 8 In flat glass would suit me great.


Should I just give up and switch brands?",samsung,2018-01-23 23:14:39

7sntz2,"Hey,
Embarrassingly, I am locked out of my samsung c9 pro. I changed my pin a week or so ago but never used it because fingerprints, and as I have the Secure Startup option turned on (the one which tells you to enter your pin on startup to even startup the phone), I can't do the standard ""forgot password"" and enter account details stuff (idek if you can do that on samsung but w/e). 

I've spent the past hour messing around with a few different phone softwares (dr.fone...some other one...even tried rooting it but realised i had usb debugging turned off so thats not an option). 

Is there hope or will I have to factory reset?

Any help greatly appreciated.",samsung,2018-01-24 07:30:20

7spuik,"I have been dealing with a couple issues since Nov of 2017 after ordering a Note 8 from Samsung's website.

The first issue was ordering the phone, I ordered it because I was waiting for the new blue Note 8 color, and ordered it on the 16th, but that order stayed in processing for over a week, and Samsung customer service could never give me a straight answer for why it was being held up (it wasn't a stock issue).

I eventually ended up cancelling that order and ordering again. This time there was a promo offer for a free gear 360, but during the order process it never gave me the option to select my promo gift (which it is apparently supposed to do). I have never ordered from Samsung direct and didn't realize that something was off, so after a week I called in to find out how I claim my promo to be told I didn't qualify, and there was nothing they could do. I was eventually given an email to the office of the president, and after a month of back and forth emails was given a promo code for the Gear 360.

When the package finally arrived at my office I opened it (in front of co-workers) and it was empty, save for the bubble wrap and receipt. From here I called Samsung again and opened a case to get another promo code. 

First I was told the code was approved and I would have it by the 12th of Jan. When I did not receive a new promo code I called on the 15th and was told it would take 7 more days. Here we are today and I was just told my Promo code was denied and they are still investigating with no updated ETA.

I have several email exchanges with one rep and they obviously have the issues noted on my account, but this is ridiculous how poor their customer service is at communication and providing solutions.

Moral of the story is never, ever buy anything from samsung.com. 

Anyone else have any horror stories regarding their experience with Samsung customer service?

(P.S. - I have worked in a customer service environment before, and I will say that the representatives I worked will were nice, and doing their job (and I tried my best to not take my frustration out on the rep), my anger is pointed at Samsung for not supplying their front lines with the adequate tools to truly help their customers. The fact that Samsung (and many other companies for that matter) operate this way show how little they care for their customers or employees).  ",samsung,2018-01-24 11:55:26

I have a Samsung KS8000 65' TV with 2 spots of discoloration.  My tv is still under warranty and had two techs out to my house today.  They saw the spots - took pictures and called Samsung - Someone on the phone said that the TV was still within specs - basically saying the problem isnt bad enough to justify a panel change.  I spent $1700 on a TV that has 2 spots of discoloration and someone on the phone who didnt even see the problem didnt approve the change.  DO NOT BUY A TV FROM SAMSUNG.  They do not honor their warranty. ",samsung,2018-01-24 12:51:54
7sre2g,"I have an SM-T800 that I've had for years. Recently loaded a custom ROM (IronROM) for lollipop and bloat removal. That was great for a while, but I just got Lineage OS for a stock android experience with this tablet.

Flashed Magisk and clocked minimum Hz down 100mhz and max up 100mhz.

This thing has still got it! Testament to Samsung's great hardware. Glad they've finally also come along on the software front as well, as this tablet's stock ROM is garbage. 

Hoping to have this a while longer, and also hoping Samsung will make another high end 10""+ tablet soon.",samsung,2018-01-24 15:16:01

7suelt,"So maybe it's just me being a worrywart but I've had my Galaxy S8 for about a year now since launch and I've loved the lil (big) guy.  My only concern is image burn in.  I've had no issues and I do all the regular safety precautions they tell you to do to avoid imagine burn in.  So maybe it's me just wondering if it's this false sense of security because I've had no sings of burn in and I was just wondering how everyone else's screens are doing?  if you look up ""Galaxy S8 burn in"" you'll always find a few hundred YouTube videos or articles talking about how ""MY SCREEN SUCK SAMSUNG IS HORRIBLE AAAAHHHHH ANGERY"" so I figured I would just ask the community to see how their phones were doing ",samsung,2018-01-24 23:06:01
7sug71,"So some backstory, I've been having issues with my S7 since November. Originally I chocked it up to network issues and put up with my phone losing data slowly before dropping the sim completely and requiring a restart.

Come about half way through December and it's booked in for repair with the network after ""replacing an internal component"" I get it back after Christmas and all was good...for about 2 weeks.

Later on this month the issues come back and have gotten worse to the point I'm restarting the phone 5 times before I get into uni. yesterday I'd had enough and gone back to calling the network big mistake.

Instead of replacing the phone or offering a temperory phone. The network wanted to find out why it didint work taking another fortnight only to tell me it's broke we fixed it here you go.

Needless to say I was not happy and tried to get the phone fixed by Samsung. What I did not expect was the outstanding customer care leagues above my network. Not only did the repair centre repair my phone they replaced the display and battery more because they couldn't nail the issue ether.

In the end the engineer believed that the network had installed a dirty motherboard. The engineer replaced it under warranty and I haven't had any issues since.

So once thank you to the Samsung team for repairing not just my phone but my trust in Samsung products. I've delibertly avoided mentioning the name of the network with good reason so as to not start a witch hunt.

TLDR: galaxy S7 developed a fault network made it worse and samsung put things right.",samsung,2018-01-24 23:15:55

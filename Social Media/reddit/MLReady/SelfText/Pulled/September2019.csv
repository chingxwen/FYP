There’s absolutely no doubt that the S10+ is impressive, I currently use an iPhone XR so I’m wondering if there is any advice that a long term Samsung user could give to somebody considering to move across and if there would be any areas that would be a noticeable difference?

I called Samsung and was told that they were under warranty and I can send them in for a replacement. Great, I send them out in July 15th

I hear and receive nothing from them for over 10 days. 

When I call they say that they did receive my earbuds on the 17th and it can take 5-7 business days to get approval, ok no problem.

After that time period ends and I hear nothing from them I call again.

I'm told that my buds in fact were approved for replacement on the 18th and they were unsure as to why they haven't been shipped yet

I get set up for a call back from Samsung case management within the next 24-48 hours

I never got a call


The next week I call again, they have no record of setting up a call back to they set up a call back again.

I have no record of a phone call, but I recieved an email from Samsung saying they called me but didn't answer, my case has been handed over to their exchange department.

Finally I call again after hearing nothing for a week saying that they are actually waiting to be shipped and are just waiting for ups pick up. I was given a ups tracking number

It's been nearly three weeks and when entered, It says it is still waiting to be shipped out.

I haven't had my earbuds in over 40 days and I've been left nothing but sickened by Samsung's disgusting and poor customer service. At this point I am complety unsure what to do and Samsung does not want to help me when I call.

cysmio,"I wanted to buy the Speed, Convenience &amp; More kit for the 45-Watt charger. But when adding it to cart, the charger disappears. The price is still included in the 150 dollars. It used my entire credit despite an item missing. 

I contacted Promotion Customer Service and they confirmed that the charger won't be part of the order.  This tells me 2 things.   

One, their website does not advertise the true prices of these products (which is illegal in a lot of places). Instead, it just uses math to calculate your ""discount"" and adjusts prices in such a way that the price has to be equal to 150. Basically they set a price for the package and the package is always the same price, regardless of how many items are missing from it. The prices they show for the individual items are basically meaningless.  

Two, I asked the customer service rep on the phone if there's someone I can contact about this, or if she can escalate it to fix this supposedly broken thing, and she said she gets phone calls like this every day about things missing from people's orders. So they are aware of this issue, they just don't care enough to fix it.  Be careful when you use your credit. I for one am extremely disappointed with Samsung. I canceled my order and I'm gonna wait to see if/when they finally fix it. I can (sort of) accept the ""preorder and get 150 dollars worth of credit at the Samsung shop!.... that you can only use on these few items..."" thing. But going further and using up my full credit without all the items advertised is just downright scummy.

cywtb7,"As the title says, I came from the Apple world. Was using the XS Max for quite some time but over the past year I have been ridding myself of all my Apple products, freeing myself from the Apple Ecosystem. Got rid of my Apple Watch, my MacBook Pro, my iPad Pro, my AirPods, and last, my iPhone.

Since I was coming from a big phone and I am a tech geek who loves high specs, I opted for the Note 10+ at launch. I've owned Note devices in the past, liked them, but loved iPhones more so I ultimately never stayed long (especially since I had so many other Apple products). I admit that the Note 10+ seemed like a no-brainer, seeing as how Samsung cut so many spec corners with the Note 10. 

I took home my Note 10+, amazed at how big the screen was and how the battery just seemed to last forever. I was so happy to be back using such a powerhouse of a phone, using my S-Pen all the time, getting back into my Android groove. Those of you who have switched over before know how the routine can go. After a solid 7 days of implementing the phone into my daily routine and the honeymoon phase was fading, I began to notice the overall size of the device more and more. The size turned from, ""oh wow! How nice!"" straight to me being annoyed with the size. That's when I started being real with myself, reminding myself that I wanted to go smaller than the XS Max to begin with but I went with a phone even bigger (screen size) simply because I felt that I would be getting ripped off by Sammy for grabbing the smaller Note.

I decided to ignore all of the reviews from ""technology snobs"" and the angry folk here on Reddit. I realized that I was being silly, being one of those people I was labeling as a ""technology snob"". No QHD+ display even though I can barely tell the difference?! A smaller battery even though I know the battery will probably still last me through the day and if it doesn't I have 25W fast charging to fall back on to top my phone up in no time?! No expandable storage on a 256gb device even though I only use 60gb due to cloud based storage?! No time of flight sensor even though I use a DSLR to take photos, don't care about AR, and won't ever make a 3D model?! COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE SAMSUNG. I was being ridiculous.

I say ALL of that to say, man was I wrong. Man, are many of the ""technology snobs"" wrong. Going from the Note 10+ to the Note 10 was a fantastic decision. The screen is still gorgeous, capped at 1080p and all, and it is still plenty big at 6.3"". The battery has been more than enough to get me through the day. I still have yet to take a picture with it, with the exception of 1 single photo that was uploaded to my Instagram story...not even using the phone's camera app. I still use the S-Pen throughout the day, never feeling like I don't have enough screen to utilize my S-Pen. Finally, the size is PERFECT. In fact, I wish it was even a bit smaller. It feels so nice in the hand (ladies, you know the procedures), much easier to use  with one hand than the Note 10+. I can easily palm a basketball in mid-dribble, so my hands aren't small or anything.

 I love the Note 10 non-plus and think that we tech-spec geeks need to stop pissing on devices that aren't as good on paper. We sit here and praise the device we THINK should be the better device before we have even had time with each device. At the end of the day, it's all about what YOU like and what is right for YOU. The Note 10 may not be for everyone but it is definitely for me and plenty of other people out there.",samsung,2019-09-03 07:27:19

czclne,"Hey everyone, I'm in Canada and currently rocking a now 3 year old S7. I've been looking very hard in the past 2 weeks at new phones (current one is fine, just have the itch)! Checking out the Samsung site, there are promotions/sales running for both phones. Adding my S7 in as a trade in, the total for the S10+ is $1,269.99 and the Note10+ is only $1,259.99. While I was dead set on the S10+ as I probably wouldn't use the pen and the size of the Note 10+ is a little intimidating (coming from a 5.1"" screen with medium sized hands), I didn't realize the cost was *slightly* cheaper for the Note. 

My questions are: how is it in your hands (I have had limited time with display models with the cage around it), are they so big it feels like you don't have a solid grip? How does it fit in men's jeans pockets? Or should I wait for a better possible deal near the end of the year?

After flashing the stock ROM, my network no longer works and says ""Emergency calls only"". Not registered on network. The Imei currently being displayed is the new IMEI that's clean.

Obviously I'd rather have the Samsung watch as it has many other capabilities and I think they look a lot nicer than any of the Fitbit models.

Has anyone done a comparison or found that their Samsung watches have seemed off when tracking calories?

Or is there some sort of workaround to getting Fitbit apps on the Active Watch as I can't seem to see anything on the websites about this.

I get a discount using a fitness device but of course only fitbit, google fit, and apple health are approved. 

Does anyone have this same restriction, use a galaxy watch, and sync it to google fit to still get there credit? I have both a 200 dollar credit to fossil and a 150 dollar credit to samsung and just  need to know if i can make the active 2 work with my health provider. I know there is the app that syncs data from S health to google fit but just want to make sure it all works out. 

for anyone that curious/uses the same thing, my company uses ""Vitality"" to track it all. 

Also for the future if i swap out to a pixel or something else how well does the galaxy watchs work with other android phones? i know you download the samsung wear app on those devices but does it all basically work the same? 

I ask because i owned an apple watch before and its very annoying swapping platforms only to have to give up your wearable if you really love it.

I use Galaxy S10 and use Sony Sbh 54 Bluetooth headset / bundeld akg earphones with s10. Also I own a Gear fit 2 for fitness tracking but never liked to use it all the time as it doesn't look like a watch. 

I'd love to have a smartwatch that looks like a traditional watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch is the closest of all. I always wanted to buy it but couldn't get one. Now a deal is running in India which reduces the price of Galaxy watch 46 mm by 100 USD. 

Is it really worth getting one ? I need 2 day battery life and few good looking watch faces and reliable software (real time notifications on watch for ex) and how is the speaker quality for calls ?

Also I am planning to use existing gear fit 2 for fitness tracking during workouts and Galaxy Watch for the rest of time if I buy the latter.

Note: I am not fan of heavy watches on wrist and don't own a normal watch.

Note 2: For Indians, Samsung is running a corporate offer that expires tomorrow. It has almost all products of Samsung on discount with Note 10 discounted by 5k over original price includind 6k cashback offer if you use HDFC credit card for payment.

I really haven't noticed a huge different between my Note10+ all the way back to the Note7 when it comes to photos. Nothing that has made my jaw drop in quite some time.

Samsung's recent foray into portrait modes, both for video and regular pictures, leave a lot to be desired. What the cameras are able to produce with the aforementioned settings often come out looking a bit too faked for me to bother with. If I want a blurry background, I just set the focus point where I need it. I yield better better results this way vs the software blurred backgrounds.

d1cwvn,"I'll start.

-Software support: Honestly, with the newly announced list of phones that will get Android 10, there are some that are missing. Mainly S8, S8+ and Note 8.  If Samsung wanted to give up the habit of ""2 Android updates only"", and actually not forget their older devices, now is the perfect time to do that. The S7 and S8 are different phones. S7 may not have been suitable for One UI, but we already know that S8 is for Android 10. The hardware can handle it (There are devices with the same hardware as S8 that are getting 
10) and the design is almost the same as S9. One UI changed a lot of things, but Android 10 won't.  I think Samsung should stary giving their flagships 3 updates instead of 2. I mean, the A8 started on Nougat and is getting the update, so I don't see the problem. A lotta people don't buy Samsung phones because of the software support.
-Headphone jack: Well, it's a shame that it's gone on the Note 10. Kinda weird, since Samsung used to make fun of Apple for it. Well, I think Samsung still has time to go back. Remember the S6 days? They removed a lot of features, for no reason at all. And then, when things turned around, they changed them back with the S7. Samsung still can put the headphone jack on the S11. There are a lot of people who buy S10s instead of Note 10s because of the jack. We'll forgive you, Samsung.
-Exynos extravaganza: I honestly do not understand why Samsung still makes 2 versions of their phones. Snapdragon definitely performs better in the long run. It's kinda weird how some regions have features that others don't just because of the chip. Samsung should just make 1 version of their phones, instead of 2.

I have never posted here, but I wanted to know if this is a common problem...

In my family, we have a 3 S7 Edge and 1 S6 Galaxy Edge Samsung phones. Something weird started to happen with my phone, when I was using it, all of sudden the phone crashed and it suddenly rebooted back up to the logo screen. It then kept on boot looping. I can say for my phone the very least, that I don't install apps outside the play store, I have never put it underwater, I have always stayed away from anything that seemed like a virus, and I rarely have dropped my phone. Probably the last time I have dropped it was over 6 months ago (with case and everything).

 I went to the official Samsung Service center to get this issue fixed, but they said it was a mother board issue. They said that the repair costs will cost about 300 - 400 dollars. I was surprised. 

But here is the kicker, the same exact issue started to happen to another S7 Edge that we own. It randomly crashed and it started boot looping.  Again the Samsung service center reps said that it was a mother board issue and gave us a same ballpark estimate for repairs. 

At this point, I though this was very bad luck, but here what made me question. At the service center I was not the only customer with the boot loop. There were people with S6, S7, and even S8 phones that are starting to run into the same issue.

Here is a tip to minimize the risk. In the AoD settings, there is a brightness setting. I thought this was only for the AoD. I enabled AoD, cranked the brightness down as much as possible, then disabled AoD and voila the charging icon remains at that same brightness setting. 

To be sure, I did the reverse and put the brightness full. Sure enough the icon was super bright. Hope this help a little and while it won't elimnate the rick of burn in, it will minimize the risk, and if burn in does occur, it'll be less noticable.

After updating I was greeted by a nasty surprise; the phone significantly slowed down. For example, if Snapchat took 3 seconds to start, it now takes about 10 seconds. Same goes for almost all my apps.
I already rebooted my phone and cleared the cache partition.

American owners of an S9 or S9+ also complain about their phone being sluggish, so this issue is spread over multiple countries and devices.

I'm now looking for the previous firmware version to restore my phone, because this experience is pure crap.

d1u0pg,"I'm interested in the new tab s6 with the keyboard cover - finally a tablet keyboard with a touchpad!

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few questions on how **autocorrect / predictive text works** with the physical keyboard.

**Does it use SwiftKey** or Samsung's own app/system?

Is it enabled or disabled by default? **How easy is it to turn it on or off?** Is it something like a quick button on the screen, or is it a matter of going through 5 or 6 levels of menus in the settings?

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, when I type on screen, without the physical keyboard, I will want predictive text on.

&amp;#x200B;

When I type on the keyboard, I will want it on in some cases (eg if I type in another language and need certain symbols or accents) and off in others, e.g. if I need to write short bits of code.

&amp;#x200B;

**My experience with bluetooth keyboards on the Galaxy Tab S2 with SwiftKey is that disabling predictive text requires digging through multiple levels of menus hidden in the settings, and there is no easily accessible on/off button. Is it the same with the Tab s6 keyboard cover?**",samsung,2019-09-10 01:28:17

d1u3ns,"Hi!

I bought a pair of Buds a few months ago and recently forgot them in a rental car arm rest. The thing is, I engraved my phone number on the case so whoever has them can easily contact me, but nobody has yet. I called the rental branch the next morning and they couldn't find them in lost/found, and contacted the person who picked up the car after me so I know either the person who cleaned the car or the next customer have them. I don't want to accuse anyone because I still need a working relationship with this specific rental branch, but I know the person who cleans cars Mon-Friday has a Samsung phone so he might be more apt to hold on to them, and I want to give benefit of the doubt of course.

&amp;#x200B;

I still have the retail box/ receipt with the Samsung serial numbers and can prove ownership even if they factory reset/ scratch off my engraving. I am wondering if there's any way for me to track who is using them now? All of my Google &amp; Reddit searches assume that I lost them at home/ still in range.

I got a second hand pair of IconX and I believe they're the 2018 version. They've worked flawlessly so far, but today I let them die (0% battery). I put them into the charger (not the original, but still a Samsung charger, USB-C) and after a day and a half they still claim to only have 5% battery and soon after immediately die. I've changed chargers (non-samsung USB-C), connected them to an outlet and a PC with both chargers yet nothing seems to have helped.

&amp;#x200B;

Because it won't let me soft reset via Wearables without a battery charge above 20%, I tried a hard reset. However, even when doing so, the LED-light didn't blink when I followed the instructions.

d1x81p,"So I woke up this morning to find an update for my phone waiting for me and I was hoping that it would finally be the night mode update and low and behold it is. But then I started to notice something, something kind of obnoxious and I wasn't sure if it was new or had always been there. But I was pretty sure that it was new. When using the swipe gestures I noticed that whenever I would swipe up to go home, back or open my recent apps, the phone would vibrate. I found a way to turn this off and I swear everything felt as it did before to the best of my knowledge, except now when I swipe my pattern in there is no vibartion. So my question in all this is sort of a basic one. There was no vibration when using gestures before right? Tbh I noticed the new vibrations right away because when you swipe home you don't normally feel anything unless you swipe and hold to bring up google assistant. I don't know why Samsung would do this. They make these random changes that don't need to be made. Like for anyone using the old school navigation bar, I hate how the swipe up feature on the S8 just got removed and instead your navigation bar has to stay on the screen the whole time. They probably did this so people wouldn't get confused but I think we could have trusted people to know the difference. I also just noticed as I typed this that when you highlight a word while typing and drag the cursor around it vibrates now too.",samsung,2019-09-10 05:14:38

I always listen to Podcasts and when I go running I dont want to carry my Smartphone with me. In this guide I will show you how you can Sync your Podcasts with your Samsung Watch.

**Requirements**:

* Google Podcasts(Free Podcast app)
* Samsung Watch (I have a gear S3, should work on newer modells)

**Steps**

1. Open Google Podcasts and tap on the 3 dots at the top right and select settings
2. Press on automatic downloads and enable it
3. Select your desired podcasts (Google will automatically download new episodes for you)
4. Open Samsungs Galaxy Wearable app
5. If you have multiple devices here select your watch
6. Go to ""Add content to your watch""
7. Enable ""Auto sync""
8. If for some reason your Podcasts wont automatically transfer to your watch you can transfer them manually with the ""Add track"" option

Thats it. Everytime Google Podcast downloads a new episode it will transfer over to your Watch. The reason this works is that Google stores your Podcasts as mp3's and unencrypted. If you found anything wrong with this post let me know and Ill change it.",samsung,2019-09-12 03:09:14

d37gfr,"DeX was always meant to be for those who wanted to carry less, have all of their tools in their pocket.  With the new age of mobile computing where the cloud runs all of our applications and all you need is a screen, a battery and a browser, does DeX and Android have a place in a sea of affordable iPads, Chromebooks and Windows laptops? Microsoft will be dropping a new OS not too far in the future which will only increase the appeal of Windows in the education and light-computing market.

I knows DeX is a bit of a gimmick for some but I know it has so much potential as a Linux-based OS with just as much flexibility as Windows in some respects. It has the productivity apps (both Microsoft and Google are standing behind it), but can Samsung turn it into something truly special, more than just a reskinned Android homescreen with resizable windows?

I hope to see a truly mobile operating system with

* Good RAM management to maximise battery life
* Floating, SNAPPABLE windows
* Flexible and resizable applications
* Better native file managemtn like in Windows 10
* Tighter cloud storage integration like Windows file explorer
* Intuitive gestures on both the trackpad and on-screen navigation buttons
* A consistent design language like MacOS
* Smooth animations like in iOS

And just generally a better tablet computer experience

Tell me if i'm hoping for too much but I have a vision for DeX and I really hope it can become a competitive alternative to the tightly controlled (and non-open source) OSs that dominate the market",samsung,2019-09-12 20:52:25

Just click through setup window and you're done. As with a desktop device (Windows PC or Mac).

If this is done there is still this Apple ID window in the setup. The incredible buggy is when you have a weak internet connection or data plan from the sim card is empty. It doesn't load anything and the user gets stuck in the setup window.

I'm currently using a S10 fyi. I told my brother after the reveal of the iPhone11 I would order one but really the presentation didn't wow me.

This is really just another 'S' iteration of the iPhone, so I expect next year would be the year to upgrade. Samsung already has a triple camera setup (quad cam setup looking at the Note10+). It surprised me that the base storage for the 'Pro' iPhones are 64gb, for them starting at $999 that's outrageous. 

The standard iPhone11 looks like a great buy compared to the Pro models, you can pick one up and the new Apple Watch Series 5 for the same price as a iPhone 11 Pro Max. 

Lately Samsung has been doing great with their software and ecosystem. I have a Gear S3 and it's great, the new Galaxy Watch Active2 looks great and they added back the bezel functionality with touch. I have the Galaxy Buds and I love them, they're sleek and black. Sound is superb imo but the talk back audio quality is okay on the opposite end. The Tab S6 looks like a great competitor towards the iPad Pro, the software experience keeps getting polished and DeX looks promising. 

So really I couldn't pull the trigger just yet or maybe not even at all as the software will continue to mature and the ecosystem will get even better with Samsung. I've always been using Samsing and they've definitely have come a long way.

I'm regretting taking off the Samsung one and am currently screen protector-less. Checking the reviews, I see they were made before the phone even came out, on the same day. All 30 of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone link me a good screen protector or better yet, does Samsung sell one themselves?",samsung,2019-09-02 16:53:38

cyr0rx,"The right ear bud became very quiet for some reason. I followed all troubleshooting tips and nothing worked

I called Samsung and was told that they were under warranty and I can send them in for a replacement. Great, I send them out in July 15th

I hear and receive nothing from them for over 10 days. 

When I call they say that they did receive my earbuds on the 17th and it can take 5-7 business days to get approval, ok no problem.

After that time period ends and I hear nothing from them I call again.

I'm told that my buds in fact were approved for replacement on the 18th and they were unsure as to why they haven't been shipped yet

I get set up for a call back from Samsung case management within the next 24-48 hours

I never got a call


The next week I call again, they have no record of setting up a call back to they set up a call back again.

I have no record of a phone call, but I recieved an email from Samsung saying they called me but didn't answer, my case has been handed over to their exchange department.

Finally I call again after hearing nothing for a week saying that they are actually waiting to be shipped and are just waiting for ups pick up. I was given a ups tracking number

It's been nearly three weeks and when entered, It says it is still waiting to be shipped out.

I haven't had my earbuds in over 40 days and I've been left nothing but sickened by Samsung's disgusting and poor customer service. At this point I am complety unsure what to do and Samsung does not want to help me when I call.

I don't know what my purpose for this post is, I just hope someone may see it and have a solution or to get attention of Samsung. Thank you for reading.",samsung,2019-09-03 00:12:54

So what Samsung did (I think) is make is dark but not off so the ghosting isn't as bad. Sorry if you didn't noticed it, you can't unsee it anymore haha

cysmio,"I wanted to buy the Speed, Convenience &amp; More kit for the 45-Watt charger. But when adding it to cart, the charger disappears. The price is still included in the 150 dollars. It used my entire credit despite an item missing. 

I contacted Promotion Customer Service and they confirmed that the charger won't be part of the order.  This tells me 2 things.   

One, their website does not advertise the true prices of these products (which is illegal in a lot of places). Instead, it just uses math to calculate your ""discount"" and adjusts prices in such a way that the price has to be equal to 150. Basically they set a price for the package and the package is always the same price, regardless of how many items are missing from it. The prices they show for the individual items are basically meaningless.  

Two, I asked the customer service rep on the phone if there's someone I can contact about this, or if she can escalate it to fix this supposedly broken thing, and she said she gets phone calls like this every day about things missing from people's orders. So they are aware of this issue, they just don't care enough to fix it.  Be careful when you use your credit. I for one am extremely disappointed with Samsung. I canceled my order and I'm gonna wait to see if/when they finally fix it. I can (sort of) accept the ""preorder and get 150 dollars worth of credit at the Samsung shop!.... that you can only use on these few items..."" thing. But going further and using up my full credit without all the items advertised is just downright scummy.

cywtb7,"As the title says, I came from the Apple world. Was using the XS Max for quite some time but over the past year I have been ridding myself of all my Apple products, freeing myself from the Apple Ecosystem. Got rid of my Apple Watch, my MacBook Pro, my iPad Pro, my AirPods, and last, my iPhone.

Since I was coming from a big phone and I am a tech geek who loves high specs, I opted for the Note 10+ at launch. I've owned Note devices in the past, liked them, but loved iPhones more so I ultimately never stayed long (especially since I had so many other Apple products). I admit that the Note 10+ seemed like a no-brainer, seeing as how Samsung cut so many spec corners with the Note 10. 

I took home my Note 10+, amazed at how big the screen was and how the battery just seemed to last forever. I was so happy to be back using such a powerhouse of a phone, using my S-Pen all the time, getting back into my Android groove. Those of you who have switched over before know how the routine can go. After a solid 7 days of implementing the phone into my daily routine and the honeymoon phase was fading, I began to notice the overall size of the device more and more. The size turned from, ""oh wow! How nice!"" straight to me being annoyed with the size. That's when I started being real with myself, reminding myself that I wanted to go smaller than the XS Max to begin with but I went with a phone even bigger (screen size) simply because I felt that I would be getting ripped off by Sammy for grabbing the smaller Note.

I decided to ignore all of the reviews from ""technology snobs"" and the angry folk here on Reddit. I realized that I was being silly, being one of those people I was labeling as a ""technology snob"". No QHD+ display even though I can barely tell the difference?! A smaller battery even though I know the battery will probably still last me through the day and if it doesn't I have 25W fast charging to fall back on to top my phone up in no time?! No expandable storage on a 256gb device even though I only use 60gb due to cloud based storage?! No time of flight sensor even though I use a DSLR to take photos, don't care about AR, and won't ever make a 3D model?! COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE SAMSUNG. I was being ridiculous.

I say ALL of that to say, man was I wrong. Man, are many of the ""technology snobs"" wrong. Going from the Note 10+ to the Note 10 was a fantastic decision. The screen is still gorgeous, capped at 1080p and all, and it is still plenty big at 6.3"". The battery has been more than enough to get me through the day. I still have yet to take a picture with it, with the exception of 1 single photo that was uploaded to my Instagram story...not even using the phone's camera app. I still use the S-Pen throughout the day, never feeling like I don't have enough screen to utilize my S-Pen. Finally, the size is PERFECT. In fact, I wish it was even a bit smaller. It feels so nice in the hand (ladies, you know the procedures), much easier to use  with one hand than the Note 10+. I can easily palm a basketball in mid-dribble, so my hands aren't small or anything.

 I love the Note 10 non-plus and think that we tech-spec geeks need to stop pissing on devices that aren't as good on paper. We sit here and praise the device we THINK should be the better device before we have even had time with each device. At the end of the day, it's all about what YOU like and what is right for YOU. The Note 10 may not be for everyone but it is definitely for me and plenty of other people out there.",samsung,2019-09-03 07:27:19

Checking out the Samsung site, there are promotions/sales running for both phones. Adding my S7 in as a trade in, the total for the S10+ is $1,269.99 and the Note10+ is only $1,259.99. While I was dead set on the S10+ as I probably wouldn't use the pen and the size of the Note 10+ is a little intimidating (coming from a 5.1"" screen with medium sized hands), I didn't realize the cost was *slightly* cheaper for the Note. 

My questions are: how is it in your hands (I have had limited time with display models with the cage around it), are they so big it feels like you don't have a solid grip? How does it fit in men's jeans pockets? Or should I wait for a better possible deal near the end of the year?

When doing the trade, I matched the IMEI of the Box to the IMEI of the sticker on the phone and forgot to check the IMEI on the handset itself.

Running an IMEI check shows that the phones Imei is clean but the IMEI on the box is blacklisted. 

The phone worked fine but it did seem 'off' because the guy told me it has warranty but S-Health and secure folder didn't work. I found out that this was because Knox has been triggered. When I used it for a few weeks, my network worked fine. 

Last night I checked the system status and it showed me 'Unofficial' (Custom Binary) so I decided to download the proper stock Rom from SamMobile and flash it. 

After flashing the stock ROM, my network no longer works and says ""Emergency calls only"". Not registered on network. The Imei currently being displayed is the new IMEI that's clean. 

How can I get the networks to work again like it did before and why did my network stop working if this 'new' Imei is clean?

Using my cable in the pc to charge, works. It's not the outlet either because we used that one to charge his phone and it worked. The main issue is that the usb port I have left is sort of weak and it disconnects all the time, which is annoying (lags my games for a second when it happens, the disconnect and connecting sounds every time it happens. It even seems to disconnect when nothing is moving or touching the cable). It also has no fast charging through the pc.

I recently bought a Galaxy A50 to replace my old Pixel 2 XL that had completley broken after a few too many drops. It was not worth the fix and I didn't have enough money to buy another flagship. I own a Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2019) so I'm no stranger to Samsung and One UI and am waiting for the phone to come in the mail.

My question is, are there any performance differences between the 4GB and 6GB RAM models? My old Pixel 2 XL was decent in RAM management, not amazing but that had 4GB. How is RAM management with the A phone models from Samsung? The Tab A does okay with 2GB of RAM as I have the base model which is ONLY used for netflix and Youtube with no multitasking.

d09v0i,"Hey, for all of you who use GW for running.. I really like the design(That's why i'd prefer it over active) and functions, but i'll be doing a lot of running with it..  Is it comfortable? The reviews i watched praised the heart rate sensor and gps, but nobody ever adressed wether it's comfortable for medium-long runs(like 20km/12.5miles) considering the bulkier design.. 

Bonus somewhat GW unrelated question: Does the run tracking app account for elevation? Been using a band that doesn't have altimeter till now, so running up a massive hill counted almost the same amount of calories burned as the exact distance ran on a flat road.. Saw that it counts floors, but i'm not nearly fit enough to run exclusively up and down the stairs... :D",samsung,2019-09-06 09:24:28
d0a0ka,"So I have spent 14 days with my Galaxy Note10+ and yes this truly is The best phone out now. Now I’m coming from a iPhone 7 Plus, and the transition from iPhone to Android was very easy for me being that my first phone was the Galaxy S4 and second was the Note5. The experience I'm having has been awesome! 

The highlight for me other than the gorgeous display and S-Pen is the Battery Life and the charging speed. I call the charging speed flash charge. 25Watt is a knockout and I never have to worry about charging it. I love it!! I'll talk more about it once I post my review where I throw it all on the table and discuss my pros and cons next week but folks...

d0bps2,"I really wish Samsung would make a much more noticeable leap in the camera and the software that runs it. Don't get me wrong, I have always loved the camera on every Samsung I've had and the photos do come out great. I just don't think they're trying hard enough or doing something fantastic to set themselves apart. I really haven't noticed a huge different between my Note10+ all the way back to the Note7 when it comes to photos. Nothing that has made my jaw drop in quite some time.

Samsung's recent foray into portrait modes, both for video and regular pictures, leave a lot to be desired. What the cameras are able to produce with the aforementioned settings often come out looking a bit too faked for me to bother with. If I want a blurry background, I just set the focus point where I need it. I yield better better results this way vs the software blurred backgrounds.

I think Samsung needs to do something big in the camera department and just stop with the gimmicks.",samsung,2019-09-06 12:14:29

Whwn my phone was retuened, I received the same damaged usb c cable, and discovered hundreds of scratches on my phone. I received several different stories of why, two people claimed that the repair was not complete. So back to samsung my device went. Then I received that same broken charger in the mail again, but no phone. I waited a couple more days then called samsung. First, they claimed that they had already delivered my phone. Then, the story changed that it takes 7-10 buisness days and that it had only been 7 days. Ten days comes and goes: No phone. I call and now the story is that it actually takes 14 days. I am irate at this point. I get a call from case management where they finally admit that they thought my phone was delivered. After demanding compensation (oroginally in the form of a free upgrade to an s10) the best I could negotiate qqa a free 50 dollar wireless charger. A week goes by: No phone and no wireless charger. I call again ans finally talk to possibly the only decent human being working in samsung tech support. She lets me know my phone and charger have been shipped, and emails me details. 3 days later, it actually ships.

I get a brand new replacemenr phone in the mail. But the story doesnt end.

Instead of receiving a wireless charger, I received a single sim card tray in the mail. At this point I feel like someone at the El Paso repair facility is fucking with me. This is further solidified by an email I received a week ago  claiming they ""need me to send my phone in in order to continue with the replacement"".

 I had a waterproof case on my previous phone and it made me feel a lot better. I often take my phone by the pool, on hikes or to listen to podcasts in the shower, and while I never have dropped my previous phone into water, it would be nice if I didn't break my phone if it were to happen.

That being said I'm surprised there isn't a single option, even a cheap Chinese knock off option to get a waterproof case that I could find. 

Is it because the phone is so new? Or because it's not a flagship? Or am I just blind?",samsung,2019-09-08 23:31:51
d1cwvn,"I'll start.

-Software support: Honestly, with the newly announced list of phones that will get Android 10, there are some that are missing. Mainly S8, S8+ and Note 8.  If Samsung wanted to give up the habit of ""2 Android updates only"", and actually not forget their older devices, now is the perfect time to do that. The S7 and S8 are different phones. S7 may not have been suitable for One UI, but we already know that S8 is for Android 10. The hardware can handle it (There are devices with the same hardware as S8 that are getting 
10) and the design is almost the same as S9. One UI changed a lot of things, but Android 10 won't.  I think Samsung should stary giving their flagships 3 updates instead of 2. I mean, the A8 started on Nougat and is getting the update, so I don't see the problem. A lotta people don't buy Samsung phones because of the software support.
-Headphone jack: Well, it's a shame that it's gone on the Note 10. Kinda weird, since Samsung used to make fun of Apple for it. Well, I think Samsung still has time to go back. Remember the S6 days? They removed a lot of features, for no reason at all. And then, when things turned around, they changed them back with the S7. Samsung still can put the headphone jack on the S11. There are a lot of people who buy S10s instead of Note 10s because of the jack. We'll forgive you, Samsung.
-Exynos extravaganza: I honestly do not understand why Samsung still makes 2 versions of their phones. Snapdragon definitely performs better in the long run. It's kinda weird how some regions have features that others don't just because of the chip. Samsung should just make 1 version of their phones, instead of 2.

I have never posted here, but I wanted to know if this is a common problem...

In my family, we have a 3 S7 Edge and 1 S6 Galaxy Edge Samsung phones. Something weird started to happen with my phone, when I was using it, all of sudden the phone crashed and it suddenly rebooted back up to the logo screen. It then kept on boot looping. I can say for my phone the very least, that I don't install apps outside the play store, I have never put it underwater, I have always stayed away from anything that seemed like a virus, and I rarely have dropped my phone. Probably the last time I have dropped it was over 6 months ago (with case and everything).

 I went to the official Samsung Service center to get this issue fixed, but they said it was a mother board issue. They said that the repair costs will cost about 300 - 400 dollars. I was surprised. 

But here is the kicker, the same exact issue started to happen to another S7 Edge that we own. It randomly crashed and it started boot looping.  Again the Samsung service center reps said that it was a mother board issue and gave us a same ballpark estimate for repairs. 

At this point, I though this was very bad luck, but here what made me question. At the service center I was not the only customer with the boot loop. There were people with S6, S7, and even S8 phones that are starting to run into the same issue. 

At this point I am thinking Samsung playing dirty here. I wanted to know if you are facing this issue....",samsung,2019-09-09 05:51:06

Here is a tip to minimize the risk. In the AoD settings, there is a brightness setting. I thought this was only for the AoD. I enabled AoD, cranked the brightness down as much as possible, then disabled AoD and voila the charging icon remains at that same brightness setting. 

To be sure, I did the reverse and put the brightness full. Sure enough the icon was super bright. Hope this help a little and while it won't elimnate the rick of burn in, it will minimize the risk, and if burn in does occur, it'll be less noticable.

**Does it use SwiftKey** or Samsung's own app/system?

Is it enabled or disabled by default? **How easy is it to turn it on or off?** Is it something like a quick button on the screen, or is it a matter of going through 5 or 6 levels of menus in the settings?

Samsung products are my favorite and in my opinion , blow iphone and Apple out of the water. The only place Apple excels Vs. Sammy  is in their customer service. Apple does a great job with their customer support.

I always listen to Podcasts and when I go running I dont want to carry my Smartphone with me. In this guide I will show you how you can Sync your Podcasts with your Samsung Watch.

**Requirements**:

* Google Podcasts(Free Podcast app)
* Samsung Watch (I have a gear S3, should work on newer modells)

**Steps**

1. Open Google Podcasts and tap on the 3 dots at the top right and select settings
2. Press on automatic downloads and enable it
3. Select your desired podcasts (Google will automatically download new episodes for you)
4. Open Samsungs Galaxy Wearable app
5. If you have multiple devices here select your watch
6. Go to ""Add content to your watch""
7. Enable ""Auto sync""
8. If for some reason your Podcasts wont automatically transfer to your watch you can transfer them manually with the ""Add track"" option

Thats it. Everytime Google Podcast downloads a new episode it will transfer over to your Watch. The reason this works is that Google stores your Podcasts as mp3's and unencrypted. If you found anything wrong with this post let me know and Ill change it.",samsung,2019-09-12 03:09:14

With the new age of mobile computing where the cloud runs all of our applications and all you need is a screen, a battery and a browser, does DeX and Android have a place in a sea of affordable iPads, Chromebooks and Windows laptops? Microsoft will be dropping a new OS not too far in the future which will only increase the appeal of Windows in the education and light-computing market.

I knows DeX is a bit of a gimmick for some but I know it has so much potential as a Linux-based OS with just as much flexibility as Windows in some respects. It has the productivity apps (both Microsoft and Google are standing behind it), but can Samsung turn it into something truly special, more than just a reskinned Android homescreen with resizable windows?

I hope to see a truly mobile operating system with

* Good RAM management to maximise battery life
* Floating, SNAPPABLE windows
* Flexible and resizable applications
* Better native file managemtn like in Windows 10
* Tighter cloud storage integration like Windows file explorer
* Intuitive gestures on both the trackpad and on-screen navigation buttons
* A consistent design language like MacOS
* Smooth animations like in iOS

And just generally a better tablet computer experience

d3muko,"I have the android pie beta right now and I dont receive updates and Samsung security is not working and neither is the secure folder. I want to revert it. I tried before but it didn't really work. My question is how do I do that and not lose any data? If I backup my phone wont it backup the firmware too so that even if i go back to normal it will bring me back to the beta cause of the backup? 

Thanks",samsung,2019-09-13 17:45:36

Yes, I know there are apps that can do it but that's not why I buy the phone.",samsung,2019-09-13 19:47:01
d3ok0l,"I have made a discovery and immediately show that all Android devices are more private than iPhones or iPads.

When I used the Samsung Galaxy S10+ for the first time I noticed it immediately. You can set up your device locally without internet or anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Just click through setup window and you're done. As with a desktop device (Windows PC or Mac).

&amp;#x200B;

I had iPhones and iPads for years. And I always found it bad to buy a new iOS device. That you should always activate it and need an internet connection.

If this is done there is still this Apple ID window in the setup. The incredible buggy is when you have a weak internet connection or data plan from the sim card is empty. It doesn't load anything and the user gets stuck in the setup window.

&amp;#x200B;

So were my experiences. I can say that Apple is not privacy friendly. It's that simple.",samsung,2019-09-13 20:31:13
d3oqhy,"So my 2018 Q8FN has some pretty weird issues. When playing my PS4 it will randomly reload. It’s not a full reboot but it switches to a spinning circle and then pops back up after about 5 seconds. This happens every time I play, at least once. Also when using Hulu through the TV it will occasionally like time out and completely shut down. I haven’t contacted Samsung but I’m wondering if any one else has had these issues.",samsung,2019-09-13 20:46:06
d3ortb,"I kind of regret my choice to get the iPhone XR, so my question is, do you guys (objectively) think a Galaxy S10 is a good option or not?

Feel free to share personal experiences, preferably if someone has also switched from an Apple device to a Samsung device.",samsung,2019-09-13 20:49:04
d3oz3v,"But I couldn't pull the trigger just yet. I was originally going to just to try it and be in the ecosystem with my family. (Really just iMessage and Facetime, but I've been fine being a 'green bubble' and I've been using Duo and Messenger for video chat)

I'm currently using a S10 fyi. I told my brother after the reveal of the iPhone11 I would order one but really the presentation didn't wow me.

This is really just another 'S' iteration of the iPhone, so I expect next year would be the year to upgrade. Samsung already has a triple camera setup (quad cam setup looking at the Note10+). It surprised me that the base storage for the 'Pro' iPhones are 64gb, for them starting at $999 that's outrageous. 

The standard iPhone11 looks like a great buy compared to the Pro models, you can pick one up and the new Apple Watch Series 5 for the same price as a iPhone 11 Pro Max. 

Lately Samsung has been doing great with their software and ecosystem. I have a Gear S3 and it's great, the new Galaxy Watch Active2 looks great and they added back the bezel functionality with touch. I have the Galaxy Buds and I love them, they're sleek and black. Sound is superb imo but the talk back audio quality is okay on the opposite end. The Tab S6 looks like a great competitor towards the iPad Pro, the software experience keeps getting polished and DeX looks promising. 

So really I couldn't pull the trigger just yet or maybe not even at all as the software will continue to mature and the ecosystem will get even better with Samsung. I've always been using Samsing and they've definitely have come a long way.

d3pch8,"Galaxy A70 has caught my eye and that's probably the phone that i would go for, but i've read an enormous amount of complaints regarding the fingerprint scanner. Besides that, some people pointed out that their device stopped working after a short period of time, which isn't optimal by any means. Have any of you had such experiences with your A70? What other advantages does it bring?   


Also, the M30 seemed kind of interesting, or even the A8s. 

Anyone that can describe his/her experiences with these phones?

Thank you very much!",samsung,2019-09-13 21:34:47

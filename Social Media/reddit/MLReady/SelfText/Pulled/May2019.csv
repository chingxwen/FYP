bj6152,"Warning to all SAMSUNG customers: do not use Samsung's repair/warranty service. I sent my Gear Icon X earbuds to them in mid-February and they will not send me anything back. Originally I was supposed to receive my original device, when that failed a replacement, and when that failed a refund. I have received nothing. If you call 1800SAMSUNG you can speak with the case management department but they have no way to contact any other department, have very little information, and will just lie to you about how long it will take. Now they say I have to wait an indefinite period of time for a refund, and not even a check! A stupid Visa gift card! I have been buying Samsung products for over a decade but never will again. In summation: DO NOT USER SAMSUNG'S REPAIR/WARRANTY SERVICE, THEY WILL KEEP YOUR DEVICE AND SEND YOU NOTHING.

Hello all, I have a strange one:

Not too long ago I had a Samsung JV 3 phone, which served me well, but I broke it. So the phone was replaced with an exact model. Well...

...On the previous phone I could rotate the home screen from portrait to landscape, and the phone would flip display modes. So I tried to re-instate that feature on this replacement, only to not be able to rotate the home screen.

Yes, apps rotate when flipped to landscape. Yes, I called Verizon technical support, and Verizon even got in contact with Samsung, only to have Verizon tell me that feature was never available for that model phone. The help technician double-checked with me regarding the capability of changing display modes for home screens, app screens, and I confirmed I could do it with the previous phone. She seemed confused. So was I, as I clearly remember being able to flip the phone to landscape in home screen mode.

Did I miss something? Is there a feature or setting I'm completely overlooking? Any assistance would be appreciated.

**TLDR**: I used to be able to change the orientation of my home screens to either landscape or portrait, now I cannot. I would like to be able to rotate phone home screens to both display modes.",samsung,2019-05-01 05:01:02

So seems they made yet another crap product but are trying to make things right I guess.  I was never happy with them anyway, sound always cut out, volume inconsistent etc.

bjy0zw,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this but you might have a better idea than me on why this bug (?) happened.

It happened with 1 particular song and I'm not sure if this can be reproduced on other UHQ songs. It wasn't the first time I was listening to that song but it is the first time this has happened.

I have a Samsung S8 and use the headphones that were sold with it.

Just in case, before I begin, here are the track information :

    Length: 3:55
    Bit rate: 1935 kbps
    Sample rate: 48000 Hz
    File size: 57.3 MB
    File type: Flac

I was listening to another song in the same playlist (let's call it song A). When A ended, it switched to song B via the shuffle feature. When song B loaded and started playing, the bug happened:

I heard a **very** loud noise and had to instantly remove my headphones. By turning the volume down, I could hear some strange noises. The first sounded like the wind or a river flowing. The second sounded like someone hitting a ball with a racket (something like tennis) in a very big room with a huge echo. When I looked at the player, the song looked like it was stuck (going back-and-forth from 0:00 to 0:01) but it was still playing (sometimes it would go to 0:05 but the sound didn't change at all).

I spoke with Samsung Repair and sent it in to get the screen fixed. She said it would be at least $70. 

I just got the watch back with a memo saying the watch wouldn't turn on and had a battery failure. Well, I sent the watch to them dead and the battery was fine, just needed charging. 

So, I get the watch back with a different charger than the one I sent, and the watch itself had plastic on all parts of the watch (all the small parts like new watches have). I would expect that with a watch face replacement only the watch face would have plastic. Therefore, I think they just sent a new watch instead of repairing mine. 

But here's what's weird: 
1. The bill I got just said ""free"". (So I guess good to get a new watch for free, right?)

I have a downstairs living room with a lot of natural light so I have leaned to a QLED vs OLED. I want to wall mount a 77-82 inch tv and will be using a sonos beam and sub for my sound. My budget needs to be at 3k USD.. what are peoples best recommendations? I have other samsung smart tv's in the house and while i like them im not adverse to running a external smart set up like a fire cube/Roku or something for that.

bkgusd,"Since I've bought my Note 9 the biggest thing I've hated about it is how many duplicate apps and services Samsung tries to integrate into Android. Samsung's apps and services (like Bixby) are trash, even if their actual hardware is really nice. Trying to hide and disable these things is painstaking and annoying.

The sad thing about the US Note 9 is that there is no way to unlock the bootloader, so custom ROMs are out of the question. The sad thing is that the Note 9's actual hardware (especially the screen) is the nicest of any I've ever had on the phone, but the software completely ruins my user experience. I recently flashed LineageOS on my previous phone and rooted it and I'm enjoying it so much I've seriously considered just selling my Note 9 and going back to it

So I guess as a last resort, I'm considering what I can accomplish via adb commands. I've heard of people using it to remove intrusive apps like Bixby, but my wonder is if adb commands could be used to strip out every single Samsung service and app from the OS.

My assumption would be no, but I figure it's worth asking those more experienced before I sell the phone",samsung,2019-05-04 11:06:31

bkj0t7,"so i ordered a s10e &amp; the trade in deal on march 28 and decided to ship it to school (since i'll be going back to campus for the semester, and shipping was cheaper). 

i get an email a week later saying my order has been put on temporary hold because there is another trade in going on at the same address/household. which is ridiculous since we all have different mailbox numbers at school, but we all know how samsung sucks about 1 transaction per household and whatnot.

over the next 2 weeks, i contacted customer support because i haven't received a confirmation email or any updates. at this point, i decided to give up and just wait it out, maybe i'll get a new update by the end of april. 

so, it's may 4th and still nothing. i messaged customer support one last time, and it's still on hold and they're still working on the trade-in deal before mine. after all this, i decided to cancel my order for some reasons:

1) they were offering a cheaper deal now (i paid $598 for my order, and now they're offering it at $548). 

2) i have no idea when it'll come, if it will  even come before my semester ends 

3) was hoping that prices will go down even more, so might wait until the summer 

not even 30 minutes after submitting a cancel order request, i get an email that says ""your order has been processed. expected delivery on may 14"". now this just pissed me off!! you're telling me this right after i did /that/?? 

like great, that's just wonderful news to me. it's like after talking to customer support, they notify the trade in processing team to get it together or whatever. also worth considering that they might've FINALLY sent the confirmation email when i told customer support if i'd get my money back if i cancel.",samsung,2019-05-04 16:19:21
bkj17w,"Well, as the tittle says, my battery is draining completely overnight. And I really mean completely. The phone turns off and if you turn it on you're greeted by 0% battery followed by a quick shutdown.

This started the night between May 1. and 2. I just woke up in the morning and the phone was off. Turned it on, got what I explained above. Charged it up, what not, assumed it had been near empty anyways the night before. Then the same thing happen between the 2nd and 3rd. I woke up earlier that morning to catch it at 15%. Left it like that to see would it drain further. Sure did, was empty a couple of hours latter. So, again, I charge it up and what not, kinda forget about it just leaving it in the charger, pull it out in latter, maybe around 8PM, slightly sooner possibly. Either way by the time I went to sleep at 1AM, it still had 85%. It lost 5% being just idle, which it sadly has been doing since day one, though I expected it since Samsung is known for shitty batteries. Lost another 10% to be listening to music on YT for half an hour to an hour. But, despite being out of the charger for multiple hours, it didn't drain like crazy at all, all was normal. And here I am, at 10AM, it's drained completely, once more it's off and I have to charge it.

So, two mysteries here, why is it emptying at all, and why only over night.

Anybody got any ideas? AOD was turned off the first two nights, turned it back on the last night but it only shows on screen touch and only for a few seconds, which it had been like since I got the phone in early April.

Software issue? Maybe try a factory reset? Or is it a hardware on which case I still have the warranty, though can they replace the battery since it's non-removable?",samsung,2019-05-04 16:21:19

bkq0mb,"I am currently looking to get a new phone on contract and it looks like two of my options are the Samsung Galaxy S9 or the new Galaxy A70. However, I am a bit lost with all the specs and I'm not sure which phone is the better option - I know the S9 is meant to be more ""premium"", so I'm expecting it has better build quality, but as it's a year old I'm not sure if the A70 is actually a better phone or not. The key things I want in a phone are:  


Good screen with good colours for photo editing.

Decent camera for quick snaps (doesn't need to be amazing as I have an APS-C camera I use).

Snappy performance - doesn't need to run the top games as I don't play many mobile games (mostly just Pokemon Go) but I want apps like Chrome, Instagram, and the camera to be responsive.

SD Card slot for expandable storage (I have a lot of MP3s).

Headphone jack (not a fan of the USB-C only devices that need a cable adaptor).

&amp;#x200B;

But most importantly, I want something that is going to last and remain snappy a couple of years down the road. I have had cheaper phones before that slow down really badly after a year. Also, the S9 is already a year old, so I am concerned it may stop getting software updates soon. My current phone, the Honor 8, is still pretty snappy 2 and a half years after I got it, but I'm having to replace it as it doesn't support Wi-Fi calling and the app I use for calls is being discontinued. Additionally, the headphone jack on it is getting a bit wonky and constantly disconnects. As the app is being discontinued, I've been given an offer for a £3 a month discount, but I only have 28 days before it expires so I have to pick a phone before then.  


I can get the A70 for £29 a month or the S9 for £31 a month. I'd appreciate any advice! :)",samsung,2019-05-05 05:25:41

Now, there are three options that I've considered: the Note 9 (Snapdragon and Exynos Version), the S10e (Snapdragon and Exynos Version) and the regular S10 (Snapdragon and Exynos Version) . I'm still undecided, because I've heard that Exynos Processors tend to have less battery life than the SD's ones, and on the S10e that surely would hit it hard, but I don't know if that is true.

What do you think? I might be more oriented to the Note 9 because its technically at the same price that the S10e and has more features. Although the S10 gets ""more equal"" to the Note 9... Does the Note 9 envy some characteristic of the S10 family?

I reached out to samsung and they asked me to go to UBreakIFix location(Authorized Samsung Care technicians) which i did. UbreakIFix folks told me that there's nothing they can do except for running diagnostic and uploading the results to samsung which they did. Now when i contact samsung again they are asking me to send the device back to them and after their technicians analyze the phone, they will either fix it or else provide the device replacement. Anyone having similar situation on the warranty ?

I was expecting them to send me the replacement device since it is just been 1.5 months since i got the device. Also if i had to send the device anyways what was the point in asking me to go to a Samsung Care location ?

I’ve got an older Samsung LE46F86BDX, had it since brand new 2007.

I’m looking to update the firmware, it’s currently on manufacturer revision and I understand there’s been a few updates since 07. Unfortunately these can’t be downloaded from the Samsung site and in the UK they only updated these models via service visits.

Does anybody out there have a copy of said firmware they could send me a link to.

Also for these people, can you tell me what improvements the upgrade made? I’m hoping one improvement is switching between sources!

Many thanks for any help!",samsung,2019-05-06 15:13:28

Has anyone else signed up for the Insights program for the Note 9 and noticed a sharp decrease in battery life since the app was forced to be persistent in the background?

So I'm part of the program where you got half off your Note 9 and you filled out surveys for Samsung. I know there was an app you had to access to fill out surveys but now it's on ALL THE TIME to take in information (super sketch information, IMO - I'll post the permissions in an edit).

blgsz9,"Hi,

I'm trying to help out my mother-in-law with her Galaxy S6. Unfortunately her screen cracked and it's completely black, but somehow the phone itself still works.

So far I have been able to create a backup using Samsung Find My Mobile, after I have created a Samsung account using her Google Account (Login with Google at Samsung). This works pretty well and we have been able to backup and restore her Google/Samsung Data to a new phone.

Now the last piece is driving me nuts - I'm trying to use Smart Switch to gain some local stored data on her old phone. In order to use Smart Switch I need to unlock the phone. However, I'm unable to unlock the phone, because ""unlock"" requires a sign in into her Samsung account.

Unfortunately at this very piece of pop-up there is no option to ""Sign in with a Google account"". So essentially I am stuck with a Samsung account that has no password, because I've been using her Google account. I'm also unable to change her Samsung password (on the Samsung profile page), because - oh well - I don't have a password in the first place.

Is this a glitch? Is there any way to unlock this phone at this point?

TL;DR: Can't unlock a Galaxy S6 using Find My Mobile because I'm using a linked Samsung Account (signed in via Google), but the unlock option requires a Samsung Account password - which doesn't exist.",samsung,2019-05-07 03:54:56

bli23l,"Hi everyone,

I recently switched from an iPhone to a Samsung S10. 

Overall I really like the phone, just a few teething issues I needed some help with.

Notifications:
Clearing notifications is super frustrating.
I try to clear everything as quickly as possible and I've noticed that when you pull down the bar at the top to clear notifications, it also clears the bubbles on the apps too. This is pretty frustrating. Is there a way that you can change in the settings that when you clear the bar, it doesn't clear the bubbles too? Sometimes when I do it I forget that i have a message. 

Camera:
Meh, the camera is okay. Not as good as I was expecting.
In low light my photos looks super grainy. Does anyone know how to fix or have any links to watch some decent YouTube tutorials on how to get  better with the camera?

I thought it was weird and tried to find ways to fix it today but nothing seemed to help, today it lasted around 5-6 hours and I didn't bother to charge it while I was at work so it completely died.

I then get home and try to charge it via the wall outlet, nothing.

I talk to Samsung about it and they told me it'll take 3 weeks on the conservative side to fix my phone and send it back.

Why is it plastered all over the phone and impossible to disable? It really makes me dislike Samsung who I otherwise have liked for a long time.

Is this the future of the Samsung customer experience? Forcing me to use an app that only duplicates everything that Android / Google already does? You're extremely late to the voice game party because you tried to make it hardware dependent and Google crushed you in that market by just giving it to everyone, and now my user experience has to suffer for it.

This app offers little or nothing in the way of features, tries to sell you things that are normally free, and annoys the crap out of you, forcing you to sign in just to disable it.

blwrdb,"Back in 2015, I won a Galaxy Tablet 10.5 through Verizon’s rewards sweepstakes entries.  I have had no issues with it until this weekend, when I performed a factory reset on it.  Now, it is back to the setup steps.  I select English, then connect it to WiFi.  The next page is Samsung Account.  I enter the email address and password that I have associated with the tablet, and it goes through a short process before getting a grey bubble stating “process failed.”

Here are steps that I have taken, based on reading others’ issues:

1.  I reset the password on my Samsung account and waited 24 hours before attempting to login again.  No change.

2.  I contacted Samsung via telephone, and they insist on proof of ownership using a receipt or activation from my wireless carrier.  The problem with this is that I won this tablet, so there is no proof of purchase.  It was free to me through Verizon’s sweepstakes.  Also, I never activated it on my Verizon account and it has only been used on WiFi.  After talking with Samsung, I spoke with Verizon.  Since that Rewards system no longer exists, they have no record of shipping to me.  My Verizon account only goes back 18 months, so there is no documentation there either.

3.  I found that when I received the tablet, I actually did register it for Samsung’s warranty.  I sent a screen shot to Samsung of the warranty page, listing the tablet as one of my devices.  It’s not good enough for them.  They want documentation that is impossible for me to provide.

Please advise if any action I can take to unlock this device.  I am honestly dumbfounded that having the device registered for warranty under the same Samsung account email is not proof enough that I own this tablet.  Thanks for reading.",samsung,2019-05-08 05:51:20

First of all, does Samsung ever do sales? Even though the price is already fair, my budget is a little bit tight at the moment.

bme8bn,"So... this happened last night. I am hoping somebody has an idea of what could have caused this. I am wondering if it's possible my Samsung account was hacked? 


I was reading, on reddit. Nothing going on in my phone that I know of. No new downloads or anything. Suddenly a notification pops up saying ""your device has been found"". 


I obviously got creeped out, because well, its creepy. I click on the notification to follow it. I am directed to chrome and a site for Samsung, ""find my mobile"". At this point I dont know what to do, no one should be logging in and searching for my device. I then turn off my location because like I said I dont know what to do.


Then bam, screen black, shutting down, blue screen with the word ""erasing..."" on it.


Lost everything just like that. For whatever reason my photos hadn't been backing up to Google like I thought I had set them up to do when I got the phone in September. I do have my old contacts, and my apps reinstalled but lost all their data. 

I just am puzzled and have no idea what happened to my phone. I changed my Samsung acct password. Is there anything else I can do or that I am missing here? Please help! I am worried about my personal info like bank, email, addresses and contacts that may have been stolen/compromised.

bmfkaf,"So I wanted to get something out of the way first. I was planning my review for today and oddly/unfortunately my left Galaxy bud started making a buzzing noise. I left my house, got on my bike, after 5 minutes this loud buzzing in my left ear started, and wouldn't stop even when shutting off BT on my phone. I plugged them into the Galaxy buds case to see if that did anything, and all it did was making the noise even louder, shown [here.](https://streamable.com/pxh8h)

**Update:** After it died it seemed to be working fine after charging. Resetting the buds may have worked but I didn't try that, because I didn't know you could do that. Anyone know what may have caused this?

**Sound/Loudness:**

A tie here. Surprisingly enough I liked the Galaxy Buds a tad better when on dynamic mode. The jaybird X3's get louder however, and allow more sound customization through their app. If I played with the customization more I may have liked the X3's more but Dynamic on galaxy buds is just right. Some people have said turning on dolby atmos makes them sound better but they made no difference at all. Sound is the same, as well as the loudness. I think dolby atmos just effects the speakers. Galaxy for sound, X3's for loudness.

**Comfort:**

I'm going to give this to Galaxy buds because true wireless makes a huge difference for me. The first hour is very comfortable, but after that it can get slightly uncomfortable to wear and even after adjusting, that discomfort still lingers. Regardless though, initially the fit is perfect and without the wire gives it the win for me. But I can wear the X3's longer without any discomfort at all. This can be considered a tie, but that damn wire is so annoying at the gym.

**Convenience:**

Galaxy buds easy. Which is why I fought so hard to get them with the S10e preorder (Student/employee accounts only from the 5th-7th, I made my order the 1st) The wireless charging case, and just having a case to charge them in is way better than what the X3's offer. Which is this weird wire thing I have to plug in to the headphones, then into a USB connector.

**Battery:**

Again Galaxy Buds. Samsung advertises 6 hours, while Jaybird 8 hours. I have to have the X3's volume at 60-70% if I want to even make it 6 hours. Haven't tested until dead with the Galaxy buds, but at maximum volume after 4 hours it's around 25-35% for me. No doubt it makes it 6 hours. X3's at max will die at 4 hours.

**Touch Control:**

X3's don't have this, they just have a button thing I don't actually use. The touch controls on the Galaxy buds are mediocre and inconsistent. I still use them though if I'm doing cardio. I changed the hold setting to increase/decrease volume and only use it rarely, and would rather use my phone. It's just to damn slow. Any way to speed this up?

&amp;#x200B;

All in all I much prefer the Galaxy buds for convenience. Besides the buzzing sound I got today, these are great for the price point. When I first got them the battery capacity showed a difference between left and right and I was concerned but I haven't seen that lately and it hovers around the same or 5% difference at max. Another thing I want to point out is the case is nice and minimal, and the magnetic hold is a nice addition as well. However it has more idle battery drain than I'd like.",samsung,2019-05-09 12:37:34

bmft7c,"  I recently bought a Samsung UN43RU7100FXZA UHD TV. It's working great and I'm really happy with the purchase. However it bothers me how much of the menu is used to display ads for movie rentals I'm not interested in. This kind of clutter doesn't bother a lot of people but to me it's just another corporation squawking in my ear trying to sell me something. Maybe I'm just old fashioned but I like to buy something and be in charge of how I use it.

I scoured the internet to try to figure out how to disable the display of these ads, but only found old threads of people complaining about the lack of customization of what is displayed in the home screen and that it isn't allowed for you to delete the Universal Guide app.

I found a workaround that satisfies my needs. If you go to the apps menu you can put a lock on any of the apps. Presumably this is to prevent kids from watching something they aren't supposed to. If you lock the Universal guide app it will stop the ads for movie rentals from displaying on your home screen. BOOM, no more clutter ruining my perfect homescreen and making me annoyed. Since I couldn't find this solution referenced anywhere online I felt obligated to post it, hopefully this helps some other people who were frustrated with the way Samsung has set up their software.

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming I get another Android flagship, should I be worried about slow downs, updating, etc? Prior to Samsung I was an iphone user, so I don't have experience with other brands. I might stick with Samsung just because they still have the headphone jack. but part of me feels like a change would be nice.

I like a snappy UI, but I don't game much or do multi-tasking on the phone so a flagship CPU is wasted on me other than future-proofing.

bmneei,"Hi!

So my Note 4 has been sidelined for the last two years and I was wondering if the community could guide me a bit in making some decisions? 

A bit if backstory:

I had purchased my Note 4 brand new and it was my favorite phone (besides the Nextel I530.) As it came towards the end of it's life the battery started to go only lasting me about 6-8 hours with minimal use. On the saddest day when the screen cracked I decided to let her rest.

Stuck in a dilemma of a fairly inoperable phone I came to a hard decision of leaving Samsung due to the empty Note market with the pulling of the Note 7. I had came to terms with it and jumped to the Google Pixel. 

Today I sit with that very Pixel XL in disgust which brings me to my questions.

Questions:

1. Is it worth putting in any money towards fixing the Note 4? I know older tech will put me at a disadvantage in terms of speeds and such but I'm willing to give up some of the tech. 

2. In your opinion should I just bite the bullet and get the Note 9 or wait for a Note 10? 

3. If you are team wait for 10 when do they usually release and any speculation that you can back the importance of waiting for it? 

4. If I restore the old Note 4 will this be an expensive project? It only needs a screen and battery from what I can tell. 

Closing and such:

I  miss my Note 4 and I am glad that the time for change has finally hit me. 

Sorry for the long read and any errors as I am on mobile. 

Thank you for any advice, opinions, and reading!",samsung,2019-05-10 02:34:05

I guess my issue involves the touch sensitivity of my phone.

2. S5e is slightly weaker processor than S4

So [the last Samsung phone I owned was a I-780 back in 2008](https://www.zdnet.com/product/samsung-sgh-i780/).

In the android era, I went through various phones with my last three being an Nexus 6P, a Lenovo P2 and a Nokia 7plus - each having either a stock or near stock user interface. 

I never used a Samsung because everything I had ever read was that touchwiz was trash and every picture I could find had weird comic sans or comedy fonts and reviews suggested a confusing mishmash of features.

Then I got a deal on an A70 which uses the oneUI and from an user interface point of view I've been pleasantly surprised. 

The interface is clean and easy to use and it had made me rethink my thoughts on this idea of 'stock is best'.

If I wanted a relatively stock experience it's fairly easy to turn off pretty much everything and get something similar to that. However I've realised that by and large the various options that you are presented with enhance the experience if you spend a little time with them and I know view stock as 'lacking features'.

I do wonder how many people are missing out of Samsung because their perception of what you get is as out of date as mine?",samsung,2019-05-11 19:54:06

So my family got a Samsung plasma TV in early 2009 but I’m not sure what the model is. The tv lasted for a while but then wouldn’t turn on and would only make a clicking noise, so we moved it to the garage and forgot about it. 

Well, this tv is around 50 inches diagonally and I recently thought it would be nice to have a large plasma tv for myself, so I thought about repairing it. Through a lot of research I found it’s 99% probably a blown capacitor, and after taking the case off and taking a look, I did notice a couple of bulging capacitors.

Now, I’m no electronic repair expert but I was hoping I could repair it myself. I then learned I needed a soldering iron and solder, neither of which I own or have experience in. After a bit more research I found a class action lawsuit from 2012 which bacsically means a free repair of a Samsung LED, plasma etc. television with blown capacitors. Is this service still offered, and do I have to take the tv to a Samsung store somewhere?

TLDR: I have a Samsung tv purchased in early 2009 that has blown capacitors. Is the class action lawsuit from 2012 still valid for the free repair? I couldn’t find any info on Samsung websites and calling their service line was less than productive...",samsung,2019-05-12 05:45:10

How is battery life on this device, and how well does it degrade over time? I do plan to keep it for a few years if I do get this device, but will it hold up for a few years especially when it only has 4gb of ram and the heavy skin Samsung slaps on the OS?

But then I saw the A80 and I loved the way it looked.

This means when its plugged in it essentially is a wireless charge pad(just larger). I am proposing is a stand that you could plug in the battery pack and still set your phone on top of with everything angled.

&amp;#x200B;

With this idea, you wouldn't need a wireless charge pad and a battery pack, everything would be all in one. If you want to take the battery pack just slide it out and take it with you. The stand could even have zero electronics in it or just a right angle USB C, [even just a slightly modified standard phone stand would work great.](https://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-OMOTON-Cellphone-Anti-Slip-Convenient/dp/B0744DM3Y3)

&amp;#x200B;

The main benefit of this would be you don't need to buy a wireless charge pad and a battery pack, which can easily cost $120, you could buy the $60 pack and a $10-$15 stand. Samsung could sell an official set for $80-$100.

The downsides are pretty clear too, different phones wireless chargers might not line up, meaning inserts to raise or lower the phone might be necessary to make all phones compatible. This battery packs wireless charger is slower than many desktop ones. Wireless charge pads are getting really cheap anyway so it won't matter if you buy each separately.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, I kind of like and would use something like this if it was made. I might consider buying a normal phone stand and adding a second layer to it for the phone to sit on.

I have had my Note9 since October 11th, 2018. I have done 3 factory resets since I got it. First one was due to having issues with the battery (draining quickly). That first one was done 3 months into owning it (December). Second one was the same and was done in early April. Last one I just did two days ago because of the overheating issue. I noticed it would overheat on bloons TD5, Toon Blast/Toy Blast, Ballz, and Monopoly Bingo as well as on Facebook.

My settings are as follows:

* AOD on between 9am and 12am
* Wifi on always (always home)
* BT on always
* Sound on 90% of the time (unless I am asleep or a special circumstance. Vibrate has been on since last reset)
* DND on between 12a and 9am
* Brightness 50% or less. I'm always home so most of the time it is less than 50%...more like 20% or less.
* Battery between 25% and 100%. I have wireless chargers and cable chargers everywhere so most of the time it is close to or near full charge... unless I leave it on my bed overnight.
* Navigation bar is off (swipe gestures)

Good lock has not been set up since reset. Only thing that is the same are the games I have installed. This happened around the time I installed the [Home Design](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.loop.hdmakeover) game. So during this factory reset I'm only going to restore the following apps:

* Bloons TD5
* Lastpass &amp; Lastpass Authenticator
* FB &amp; Messenger
* PulseSMS
* Banking apps
* The Weather Channel for Samsung
* Spotify
* Twitter
* Reddit (official client, usually use Sync Pro)

I'm going to use it overnight tonight to see if it happens again. I will report back with my findings.

bohk79,Personally I'm going with the S8+. Performance still feels amazing but my only problem with it is the screen burns and how common they are.,samsung,2019-05-14 19:14:46
bohm88,"So [it is a common belief that tripping KNOX affects the standard warranty](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/comments/bn0hkj/has_samsung_explicitly_said_whether_knox_warranty/) (I couldn't find quotes from Samsung, so I have no choice but to trust it for now). I'm weighing the pros and cons of rooting. Although the list of pros is getting smaller for me, when looking at cons, the biggest one was the warranty loss. [Samsung warranty policy](https://www.samsung.com/levant/support/warranty/) makes it sound like almost nothing is covered, so I looked for peoples' experience with it. So far the only common problem that is covered is battery replacement, so **I'm curious if there is anything else useful covered by Samsung smartphone warranty**.

&amp;#x200B;

List of cases that I found:

**Not covered** (all according to Samsung Warranty Policy)

* Damage due to misuse (physical, electrical or heat). I assume this will cover pretty much every case of physical damage to the device such as scratched/cracked screens, broken buttons, broken ports(?).   
Cracked screens are kind of funny because the official clear view/LED View cases seem to be a cause for a decent amount of cracked screens (phone in case falling, and then on impact the phone falls out of the case).
* Water damage... fairly odd, for a waterproof phone. Apart from warranty policy I also recall reading about several cases of Samsung services refusing to honor warranty because the phone had water damage. 
* Acts of God..... I'm not sure what that means, but I figured I'd include it, just because it gave me the image of Thor coming down from heavens, slapping the phone out of my hands and then smashing it with his hammer (with sparks and lightnings of course).

**Partially covered** (contradictory stories from different sources)**:**

* Screen burn in. [This samsung community question](https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S8/S8-screen-burn/td-p/259118) and [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS8/comments/8eddve/dont_forget_screen_burn_in_is_covered_by_samsung/), say it's covered, but comments in the second thread say that Samsung doesn't do these replacements in Poland. [A certain CNET article](https://www.cnet.com/news/oled-screen-burn-in-what-you-need-to-know/) highlights that burn in is only covered **only for normal consumer use** and not business use. Then again this article starts talking about phones and then switches to TVs, so.... take it with a grain of salt.

**Covered** (couldn't found contradictory info)**:**

* [Battery problems](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS8/comments/anv1pu/getting_battery_replaced_by_samsung_under_warranty/) (including another thread, linked in this one) says it is covered.  
Warranty policy does say that overcharging is not covered, but I couldn't find any people that had problems with that. Not sure how they would diagnose that either.

**Basically I wanna know what other warranty claims were honored or not honored** to get a better view of value of this warranty**.** To give you a few examples: SD/Sim Card suddenly not being recognized, speakers crackling up, phone restarting, etc.",samsung,2019-05-14 19:20:39

They carried out the following work and I didn't pay them a cent, I am kind of confused why they did all this. I was at least expecting to pay an inspection fee and probably for the back glass to be fixed.

They replaced the LCD due to the screen burn that was found. They also replaced the battery along with the Back glass on it as well as the home key. They also managed to clean out the charging port (this was already tried in store) which fixed the moisture warning issue.

Hello all, I have a strange one:

Not too long ago I had a Samsung JV 3 phone, which served me well, but I broke it. So the phone was replaced with an exact model. Well...

...On the previous phone I could rotate the home screen from portrait to landscape, and the phone would flip display modes. So I tried to re-instate that feature on this replacement, only to not be able to rotate the home screen.

Yes, apps rotate when flipped to landscape. Yes, I called Verizon technical support, and Verizon even got in contact with Samsung, only to have Verizon tell me that feature was never available for that model phone. The help technician double-checked with me regarding the capability of changing display modes for home screens, app screens, and I confirmed I could do it with the previous phone. She seemed confused. So was I, as I clearly remember being able to flip the phone to landscape in home screen mode.

Did I miss something? Is there a feature or setting I'm completely overlooking? Any assistance would be appreciated.

They tell me now they will give a gift card instead of a replacement.  Said gift card will take 1-2 weeks to arrive because the are super busy refunding everyone that purchased those headphones.

So seems they made yet another crap product but are trying to make things right I guess.  I was never happy with them anyway, sound always cut out, volume inconsistent etc.

Wonder if the buds are any better??  Not sure I want to take the risk on another samsung product.  Been fighting for 2 months about the Gears S3 constantly saying to update terms, yet no terms are ever presented.  Samsung support is almost as bad as Uber.",samsung,2019-05-03 00:08:34

bjy0zw,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this but you might have a better idea than me on why this bug (?) happened.

It happened with 1 particular song and I'm not sure if this can be reproduced on other UHQ songs. It wasn't the first time I was listening to that song but it is the first time this has happened.

I have a Samsung S8 and use the headphones that were sold with it.

Just in case, before I begin, here are the track information :

    Length: 3:55
    Bit rate: 1935 kbps
    Sample rate: 48000 Hz
    File size: 57.3 MB
    File type: Flac

I was listening to another song in the same playlist (let's call it song A). When A ended, it switched to song B via the shuffle feature. When song B loaded and started playing, the bug happened:

I heard a **very** loud noise and had to instantly remove my headphones. By turning the volume down, I could hear some strange noises. The first sounded like the wind or a river flowing. The second sounded like someone hitting a ball with a racket (something like tennis) in a very big room with a huge echo. When I looked at the player, the song looked like it was stuck (going back-and-forth from 0:00 to 0:01) but it was still playing (sometimes it would go to 0:05 but the sound didn't change at all).

bjzkhu,"I cracked my Galaxy Watch 2 weeks ago (accidentally hitting it against a table). 

I spoke with Samsung Repair and sent it in to get the screen fixed. She said it would be at least $70. 

I just got the watch back with a memo saying the watch wouldn't turn on and had a battery failure. Well, I sent the watch to them dead and the battery was fine, just needed charging. 

So, I get the watch back with a different charger than the one I sent, and the watch itself had plastic on all parts of the watch (all the small parts like new watches have). I would expect that with a watch face replacement only the watch face would have plastic. Therefore, I think they just sent a new watch instead of repairing mine. 

But here's what's weird: 
1. The bill I got just said ""free"". (So I guess good to get a new watch for free, right?)
But... 2. This one has worse battery life than what I sent in.

bkgusd,"Since I've bought my Note 9 the biggest thing I've hated about it is how many duplicate apps and services Samsung tries to integrate into Android. Samsung's apps and services (like Bixby) are trash, even if their actual hardware is really nice. Trying to hide and disable these things is painstaking and annoying.

The sad thing about the US Note 9 is that there is no way to unlock the bootloader, so custom ROMs are out of the question. The sad thing is that the Note 9's actual hardware (especially the screen) is the nicest of any I've ever had on the phone, but the software completely ruins my user experience. I recently flashed LineageOS on my previous phone and rooted it and I'm enjoying it so much I've seriously considered just selling my Note 9 and going back to it

So I guess as a last resort, I'm considering what I can accomplish via adb commands. I've heard of people using it to remove intrusive apps like Bixby, but my wonder is if adb commands could be used to strip out every single Samsung service and app from the OS.

i get an email a week later saying my order has been put on temporary hold because there is another trade in going on at the same address/household. which is ridiculous since we all have different mailbox numbers at school, but we all know how samsung sucks about 1 transaction per household and whatnot.

over the next 2 weeks, i contacted customer support because i haven't received a confirmation email or any updates. at this point, i decided to give up and just wait it out, maybe i'll get a new update by the end of april. 

so, it's may 4th and still nothing. i messaged customer support one last time, and it's still on hold and they're still working on the trade-in deal before mine. after all this, i decided to cancel my order for some reasons:

1) they were offering a cheaper deal now (i paid $598 for my order, and now they're offering it at $548). 

2) i have no idea when it'll come, if it will  even come before my semester ends 

3) was hoping that prices will go down even more, so might wait until the summer 

not even 30 minutes after submitting a cancel order request, i get an email that says ""your order has been processed. expected delivery on may 14"". now this just pissed me off!! you're telling me this right after i did /that/?? 

like great, that's just wonderful news to me. it's like after talking to customer support, they notify the trade in processing team to get it together or whatever. also worth considering that they might've FINALLY sent the confirmation email when i told customer support if i'd get my money back if i cancel.",samsung,2019-05-04 16:19:21
bkj17w,"Well, as the tittle says, my battery is draining completely overnight. And I really mean completely. The phone turns off and if you turn it on you're greeted by 0% battery followed by a quick shutdown.

This started the night between May 1. and 2. I just woke up in the morning and the phone was off. Turned it on, got what I explained above. Charged it up, what not, assumed it had been near empty anyways the night before. Then the same thing happen between the 2nd and 3rd. I woke up earlier that morning to catch it at 15%. Left it like that to see would it drain further. Sure did, was empty a couple of hours latter. So, again, I charge it up and what not, kinda forget about it just leaving it in the charger, pull it out in latter, maybe around 8PM, slightly sooner possibly. Either way by the time I went to sleep at 1AM, it still had 85%. It lost 5% being just idle, which it sadly has been doing since day one, though I expected it since Samsung is known for shitty batteries. Lost another 10% to be listening to music on YT for half an hour to an hour. But, despite being out of the charger for multiple hours, it didn't drain like crazy at all, all was normal. And here I am, at 10AM, it's drained completely, once more it's off and I have to charge it.

So, two mysteries here, why is it emptying at all, and why only over night.

Anybody got any ideas? AOD was turned off the first two nights, turned it back on the last night but it only shows on screen touch and only for a few seconds, which it had been like since I got the phone in early April.

bkq0mb,"I am currently looking to get a new phone on contract and it looks like two of my options are the Samsung Galaxy S9 or the new Galaxy A70. However, I am a bit lost with all the specs and I'm not sure which phone is the better option - I know the S9 is meant to be more ""premium"", so I'm expecting it has better build quality, but as it's a year old I'm not sure if the A70 is actually a better phone or not. The key things I want in a phone are:  


Good screen with good colours for photo editing.

Decent camera for quick snaps (doesn't need to be amazing as I have an APS-C camera I use).

Snappy performance - doesn't need to run the top games as I don't play many mobile games (mostly just Pokemon Go) but I want apps like Chrome, Instagram, and the camera to be responsive.

SD Card slot for expandable storage (I have a lot of MP3s).

Headphone jack (not a fan of the USB-C only devices that need a cable adaptor).

&amp;#x200B;

But most importantly, I want something that is going to last and remain snappy a couple of years down the road. I have had cheaper phones before that slow down really badly after a year. Also, the S9 is already a year old, so I am concerned it may stop getting software updates soon. My current phone, the Honor 8, is still pretty snappy 2 and a half years after I got it, but I'm having to replace it as it doesn't support Wi-Fi calling and the app I use for calls is being discontinued.

bkq5ao,"I am currently looking to get a new phone on contract and it looks like two of my options are the Samsung Galaxy S9 or the new Galaxy A70. However, I am a bit lost with all the specs and I'm not sure which phone is the better option - I know the S9 is meant to be more ""premium"", so I'm expecting it has better build quality, but as it's a year old I'm not sure if the A70 is actually a better phone or not. The key things I want in a phone are:

&amp;#x200B;

Good screen with good colours for photo editing.

Decent camera for quick snaps (doesn't need to be amazing as I have an APS-C camera I use).

Snappy performance - doesn't need to run the top games as I don't play many mobile games (mostly just Pokemon Go) but I want apps like Chrome, Instagram, and the camera to be responsive.

SD Card slot for expandable storage (I have a lot of MP3s).

Headphone jack (not a fan of the USB-C only devices that need a cable adaptor).

&amp;#x200B;

But most importantly, I want something that is going to last and remain snappy a couple of years down the road. I have had cheaper phones before that slow down really badly after a year. Also, the S9 is already a year old, so I am concerned it may stop getting software updates soon. My current phone, the Honor 8, is still pretty snappy 2 and a half years after I got it, but I'm having to replace it as it doesn't support Wi-Fi calling and the app I use for calls is being discontinued. Additionally, the headphone jack on it is getting a bit wonky and constantly disconnects. As the app is being discontinued, I've been given an offer for a £3 a month discount, but I only have 28 days before it expires so I have to pick a phone before then.

Now, there are three options that I've considered: the Note 9 (Snapdragon and Exynos Version), the S10e (Snapdragon and Exynos Version) and the regular S10 (Snapdragon and Exynos Version) . I'm still undecided, because I've heard that Exynos Processors tend to have less battery life than the SD's ones, and on the S10e that surely would hit it hard, but I don't know if that is true.

What do you think? I might be more oriented to the Note 9 because its technically at the same price that the S10e and has more features. Although the S10 gets ""more equal"" to the Note 9... Does the Note 9 envy some characteristic of the S10 family?

I reached out to samsung and they asked me to go to UBreakIFix location(Authorized Samsung Care technicians) which i did. UbreakIFix folks told me that there's nothing they can do except for running diagnostic and uploading the results to samsung which they did. Now when i contact samsung again they are asking me to send the device back to them and after their technicians analyze the phone, they will either fix it or else provide the device replacement. Anyone having similar situation on the warranty ?

I was expecting them to send me the replacement device since it is just been 1.5 months since i got the device. Also if i had to send the device anyways what was the point in asking me to go to a Samsung Care location ?

I'm trying to help out my mother-in-law with her Galaxy S6. Unfortunately her screen cracked and it's completely black, but somehow the phone itself still works.

So far I have been able to create a backup using Samsung Find My Mobile, after I have created a Samsung account using her Google Account (Login with Google at Samsung). This works pretty well and we have been able to backup and restore her Google/Samsung Data to a new phone.

Now the last piece is driving me nuts - I'm trying to use Smart Switch to gain some local stored data on her old phone. In order to use Smart Switch I need to unlock the phone. However, I'm unable to unlock the phone, because ""unlock"" requires a sign in into her Samsung account.

Unfortunately at this very piece of pop-up there is no option to ""Sign in with a Google account"". So essentially I am stuck with a Samsung account that has no password, because I've been using her Google account. I'm also unable to change her Samsung password (on the Samsung profile page), because - oh well - I don't have a password in the first place.

Is this a glitch? Is there any way to unlock this phone at this point?

blwrdb,"Back in 2015, I won a Galaxy Tablet 10.5 through Verizon’s rewards sweepstakes entries.  I have had no issues with it until this weekend, when I performed a factory reset on it.  Now, it is back to the setup steps.  I select English, then connect it to WiFi.  The next page is Samsung Account.  I enter the email address and password that I have associated with the tablet, and it goes through a short process before getting a grey bubble stating “process failed.”

Here are steps that I have taken, based on reading others’ issues:

1.  I reset the password on my Samsung account and waited 24 hours before attempting to login again.  No change.

2.  I contacted Samsung via telephone, and they insist on proof of ownership using a receipt or activation from my wireless carrier.  The problem with this is that I won this tablet, so there is no proof of purchase.  It was free to me through Verizon’s sweepstakes.  Also, I never activated it on my Verizon account and it has only been used on WiFi.  After talking with Samsung, I spoke with Verizon.  Since that Rewards system no longer exists, they have no record of shipping to me.  My Verizon account only goes back 18 months, so there is no documentation there either.

3.  I found that when I received the tablet, I actually did register it for Samsung’s warranty.  I sent a screen shot to Samsung of the warranty page, listing the tablet as one of my devices.  It’s not good enough for them.  They want documentation that is impossible for me to provide.

Please advise if any action I can take to unlock this device.  I am honestly dumbfounded that having the device registered for warranty under the same Samsung account email is not proof enough that I own this tablet.  Thanks for reading.",samsung,2019-05-08 05:51:20

At first I thought it was the TV adjusting to the content of what was being displayed however I did a bit more investigations and elimination to find out when/why it does it. 

It only ever does it when I have the HDR enabled on the TV. I have a few pieces of kit that use HDR (ATV, PS4 etc) and it’s starting to become a lot more frequent!

Any advice/workarounds? I have changed HDMI cables a few times but if paying a premium might help, I will buy better (though all the ones I use are the latest standard)

I have purchased an AV receiver which will be arriving on Friday and I will be running everything through that and the aRC port, just for more detail! 

If it’s a send to Samsung and fix job, I’ll simply just take it to Argos and exchange it for a new. It was bought on an Argos Card and they’re good at accepting returns if they’re faulty even up to 2 years in my experience!

I obviously got creeped out, because well, its creepy. I click on the notification to follow it. I am directed to chrome and a site for Samsung, ""find my mobile"". At this point I dont know what to do, no one should be logging in and searching for my device. I then turn off my location because like I said I dont know what to do.


Then bam, screen black, shutting down, blue screen with the word ""erasing..."" on it.


Lost everything just like that. For whatever reason my photos hadn't been backing up to Google like I thought I had set them up to do when I got the phone in September. I do have my old contacts, and my apps reinstalled but lost all their data.

bmfkaf,"So I wanted to get something out of the way first. I was planning my review for today and oddly/unfortunately my left Galaxy bud started making a buzzing noise. I left my house, got on my bike, after 5 minutes this loud buzzing in my left ear started, and wouldn't stop even when shutting off BT on my phone. I plugged them into the Galaxy buds case to see if that did anything, and all it did was making the noise even louder, shown [here.](https://streamable.com/pxh8h)

**Update:** After it died it seemed to be working fine after charging. Resetting the buds may have worked but I didn't try that, because I didn't know you could do that. Anyone know what may have caused this?

**Sound/Loudness:**

A tie here. Surprisingly enough I liked the Galaxy Buds a tad better when on dynamic mode. The jaybird X3's get louder however, and allow more sound customization through their app. If I played with the customization more I may have liked the X3's more but Dynamic on galaxy buds is just right. Some people have said turning on dolby atmos makes them sound better but they made no difference at all. Sound is the same, as well as the loudness. I think dolby atmos just effects the speakers. Galaxy for sound, X3's for loudness.

**Comfort:**

I'm going to give this to Galaxy buds because true wireless makes a huge difference for me. The first hour is very comfortable, but after that it can get slightly uncomfortable to wear and even after adjusting, that discomfort still lingers. Regardless though, initially the fit is perfect and without the wire gives it the win for me. But I can wear the X3's longer without any discomfort at all. This can be considered a tie, but that damn wire is so annoying at the gym.

**Convenience:**

Galaxy buds easy. Which is why I fought so hard to get them with the S10e preorder (Student/employee accounts only from the 5th-7th, I made my order the 1st) The wireless charging case, and just having a case to charge them in is way better than what the X3's offer. Which is this weird wire thing I have to plug in to the headphones, then into a USB connector.

**Battery:**

Again Galaxy Buds. Samsung advertises 6 hours, while Jaybird 8 hours. I have to have the X3's volume at 60-70% if I want to even make it 6 hours. Haven't tested until dead with the Galaxy buds, but at maximum volume after 4 hours it's around 25-35% for me. No doubt it makes it 6 hours. X3's at max will die at 4 hours.

**Touch Control:**

X3's don't have this, they just have a button thing I don't actually use. The touch controls on the Galaxy buds are mediocre and inconsistent. I still use them though if I'm doing cardio. I changed the hold setting to increase/decrease volume and only use it rarely, and would rather use my phone. It's just to damn slow. Any way to speed this up?

&amp;#x200B;

All in all I much prefer the Galaxy buds for convenience. Besides the buzzing sound I got today, these are great for the price point. When I first got them the battery capacity showed a difference between left and right and I was concerned but I haven't seen that lately and it hovers around the same or 5% difference at max. Another thing I want to point out is the case is nice and minimal, and the magnetic hold is a nice addition as well. However it has more idle battery drain than I'd like.",samsung,2019-05-09 12:37:34

bmft7c,"  I recently bought a Samsung UN43RU7100FXZA UHD TV. It's working great and I'm really happy with the purchase. However it bothers me how much of the menu is used to display ads for movie rentals I'm not interested in. This kind of clutter doesn't bother a lot of people but to me it's just another corporation squawking in my ear trying to sell me something. Maybe I'm just old fashioned but I like to buy something and be in charge of how I use it.

I scoured the internet to try to figure out how to disable the display of these ads, but only found old threads of people complaining about the lack of customization of what is displayed in the home screen and that it isn't allowed for you to delete the Universal Guide app.

I found a workaround that satisfies my needs. If you go to the apps menu you can put a lock on any of the apps. Presumably this is to prevent kids from watching something they aren't supposed to. If you lock the Universal guide app it will stop the ads for movie rentals from displaying on your home screen. BOOM, no more clutter ruining my perfect homescreen and making me annoyed. Since I couldn't find this solution referenced anywhere online I felt obligated to post it, hopefully this helps some other people who were frustrated with the way Samsung has set up their software.

I had purchased my Note 4 brand new and it was my favorite phone (besides the Nextel I530.) As it came towards the end of it's life the battery started to go only lasting me about 6-8 hours with minimal use. On the saddest day when the screen cracked I decided to let her rest.

Stuck in a dilemma of a fairly inoperable phone I came to a hard decision of leaving Samsung due to the empty Note market with the pulling of the Note 7. I had came to terms with it and jumped to the Google Pixel. 

Today I sit with that very Pixel XL in disgust which brings me to my questions.

Questions:

1. Is it worth putting in any money towards fixing the Note 4? I know older tech will put me at a disadvantage in terms of speeds and such but I'm willing to give up some of the tech. 

2. In your opinion should I just bite the bullet and get the Note 9 or wait for a Note 10? 

3. If you are team wait for 10 when do they usually release and any speculation that you can back the importance of waiting for it? 

4. If I restore the old Note 4 will this be an expensive project? It only needs a screen and battery from what I can tell. 

Closing and such:

I  miss my Note 4 and I am glad that the time for change has finally hit me. 

Sorry for the long read and any errors as I am on mobile. 

Thank you for any advice, opinions, and reading!",samsung,2019-05-10 02:34:05

I have a storage issue with my phone. 20GB is in nirvana and blocked. I have like 10GB on my local storage and it is always full.

I want to save all my data including WhatsApp Chats. I dont want to use any Samsung Cloud or Google Cloud services to backup my stuff. I want to do it locally. I tried to save it with SmartSwitch but it keeps telling me that it can't finish cause the phone does have not enough storage or RAM.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my issue involves the touch sensitivity of my phone. Sometimes, when I put my phone in my pocket, I try to make sure that the screen is off, but when I turn it back on, it seems that somehow, I've switched to another app, and if I'm in my messaging app, I might have started a draft of a new message or something. Also, at other times, when I place my phone in my pocket, I think I might have hit the center button to switch between apps, but somehow, it switches to the multi-window mode, having two apps open split screen style. This is rather annoying, and I would really like to turn off this feature. It was cool in the S4, but now, because of how it accidentally does this, it's  just annoying.

Sorry, I'm not sure as to why these issues are occurring, but it feels like the touch sensitivity might be the issue. Is there any way to fix this, or do you have any other suggestions as to how to remove these annoyances?",samsung,2019-05-11 05:10:20

I looked up the latest models and it was between S5e and S4.

I researched some comparison and few noticeable things i found were these;

1. S4 have S-pen while S5e don't.
2. S5e is slightly weaker processor than S4
3. S4 costs $800 CAD while S5e cost $550
4. S4 have 3.5mm earphone jack while S5e does not.

My mother mainly wanted to use it to watch youtube videos, and watch kdramas so when it comes to gaming and what not. she ain't really fond of it. Realistically I rather wait for S5 where it will have all the features S4 have but better, Mothers day ain't going to wait for S5 to release haha. 

Please keep in mind, she have Note 8 so to note all her information or plans and what not, she can already do that on her phone.

So [the last Samsung phone I owned was a I-780 back in 2008](https://www.zdnet.com/product/samsung-sgh-i780/).

In the android era, I went through various phones with my last three being an Nexus 6P, a Lenovo P2 and a Nokia 7plus - each having either a stock or near stock user interface. 

I never used a Samsung because everything I had ever read was that touchwiz was trash and every picture I could find had weird comic sans or comedy fonts and reviews suggested a confusing mishmash of features.

Then I got a deal on an A70 which uses the oneUI and from an user interface point of view I've been pleasantly surprised. 

The interface is clean and easy to use and it had made me rethink my thoughts on this idea of 'stock is best'.

If I wanted a relatively stock experience it's fairly easy to turn off pretty much everything and get something similar to that. However I've realised that by and large the various options that you are presented with enhance the experience if you spend a little time with them and I know view stock as 'lacking features'.

So my family got a Samsung plasma TV in early 2009 but I’m not sure what the model is. The tv lasted for a while but then wouldn’t turn on and would only make a clicking noise, so we moved it to the garage and forgot about it. 

Well, this tv is around 50 inches diagonally and I recently thought it would be nice to have a large plasma tv for myself, so I thought about repairing it. Through a lot of research I found it’s 99% probably a blown capacitor, and after taking the case off and taking a look, I did notice a couple of bulging capacitors.

Now, I’m no electronic repair expert but I was hoping I could repair it myself. I then learned I needed a soldering iron and solder, neither of which I own or have experience in. After a bit more research I found a class action lawsuit from 2012 which bacsically means a free repair of a Samsung LED, plasma etc. television with blown capacitors. Is this service still offered, and do I have to take the tv to a Samsung store somewhere?

bnshkz,"[The wireless charger battery pack](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/phones/wireless-charger-portable-battery--silver-eb-u1200cselus/?cid=pla-ecomm-pfs-cha-22019-22505&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwiN_mBRBBEiwA9N-e_sxccVG0CunuW1jE8lmkRfScLQ5PmOemRsat_vg7kossr0wovlnW3xoCRDcQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) supports passthrough charging. This means when its plugged in it essentially is a wireless charge pad(just larger). I am proposing is a stand that you could plug in the battery pack and still set your phone on top of with everything angled.

&amp;#x200B;

With this idea, you wouldn't need a wireless charge pad and a battery pack, everything would be all in one. If you want to take the battery pack just slide it out and take it with you. The stand could even have zero electronics in it or just a right angle USB C, [even just a slightly modified standard phone stand would work great.](https://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-OMOTON-Cellphone-Anti-Slip-Convenient/dp/B0744DM3Y3)

&amp;#x200B;

The main benefit of this would be you don't need to buy a wireless charge pad and a battery pack, which can easily cost $120, you could buy the $60 pack and a $10-$15 stand. Samsung could sell an official set for $80-$100.

The downsides are pretty clear too, different phones wireless chargers might not line up, meaning inserts to raise or lower the phone might be necessary to make all phones compatible. This battery packs wireless charger is slower than many desktop ones. Wireless charge pads are getting really cheap anyway so it won't matter if you buy each separately.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, I kind of like and would use something like this if it was made. I might consider buying a normal phone stand and adding a second layer to it for the phone to sit on.

bnvbj5,"I have factory reset my device and restored everything and it is still overheating. I am planning another factory reset without the restore in a few minutes.

I have had my Note9 since October 11th, 2018. I have done 3 factory resets since I got it. First one was due to having issues with the battery (draining quickly). That first one was done 3 months into owning it (December). Second one was the same and was done in early April. Last one I just did two days ago because of the overheating issue. I noticed it would overheat on bloons TD5, Toon Blast/Toy Blast, Ballz, and Monopoly Bingo as well as on Facebook.

My settings are as follows:

* AOD on between 9am and 12am
* Wifi on always (always home)
* BT on always
* Sound on 90% of the time (unless I am asleep or a special circumstance. Vibrate has been on since last reset)
* DND on between 12a and 9am
* Brightness 50% or less. I'm always home so most of the time it is less than 50%...more like 20% or less.
* Battery between 25% and 100%. I have wireless chargers and cable chargers everywhere so most of the time it is close to or near full charge... unless I leave it on my bed overnight.
* Navigation bar is off (swipe gestures)

Good lock has not been set up since reset. Only thing that is the same are the games I have installed. This happened around the time I installed the [Home Design](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.loop.hdmakeover) game. So during this factory reset I'm only going to restore the following apps:

* Bloons TD5
* Lastpass &amp; Lastpass Authenticator
* FB &amp; Messenger
* PulseSMS
* Banking apps
* The Weather Channel for Samsung
* Spotify
* Twitter
* Reddit (official client, usually use Sync Pro)

I'm going to use it overnight tonight to see if it happens again. I will report back with my findings.

Anyone run into this issue? I'm thinking about replacing with T-Mobile but it is $5 and I'm unemployed and I'm not an authorized user on my parent's account so my sister would have to pick up the phone so I'd be without one until she picked up the new phone.

bohm88,"So [it is a common belief that tripping KNOX affects the standard warranty](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/comments/bn0hkj/has_samsung_explicitly_said_whether_knox_warranty/) (I couldn't find quotes from Samsung, so I have no choice but to trust it for now). I'm weighing the pros and cons of rooting. Although the list of pros is getting smaller for me, when looking at cons, the biggest one was the warranty loss. [Samsung warranty policy](https://www.samsung.com/levant/support/warranty/) makes it sound like almost nothing is covered, so I looked for peoples' experience with it. So far the only common problem that is covered is battery replacement, so **I'm curious if there is anything else useful covered by Samsung smartphone warranty**.

&amp;#x200B;

List of cases that I found:

**Not covered** (all according to Samsung Warranty Policy)

* Damage due to misuse (physical, electrical or heat). I assume this will cover pretty much every case of physical damage to the device such as scratched/cracked screens, broken buttons, broken ports(?).   
Cracked screens are kind of funny because the official clear view/LED View cases seem to be a cause for a decent amount of cracked screens (phone in case falling, and then on impact the phone falls out of the case).
* Water damage... fairly odd, for a waterproof phone. Apart from warranty policy I also recall reading about several cases of Samsung services refusing to honor warranty because the phone had water damage. 
* Acts of God..... I'm not sure what that means, but I figured I'd include it, just because it gave me the image of Thor coming down from heavens, slapping the phone out of my hands and then smashing it with his hammer (with sparks and lightnings of course).

**Partially covered** (contradictory stories from different sources)**:**

* Screen burn in. [This samsung community question](https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S8/S8-screen-burn/td-p/259118) and [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS8/comments/8eddve/dont_forget_screen_burn_in_is_covered_by_samsung/), say it's covered, but comments in the second thread say that Samsung doesn't do these replacements in Poland. [A certain CNET article](https://www.cnet.com/news/oled-screen-burn-in-what-you-need-to-know/) highlights that burn in is only covered **only for normal consumer use** and not business use. Then again this article starts talking about phones and then switches to TVs, so.... take it with a grain of salt.

**Covered** (couldn't found contradictory info)**:**

* [Battery problems](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS8/comments/anv1pu/getting_battery_replaced_by_samsung_under_warranty/) (including another thread, linked in this one) says it is covered.  
Warranty policy does say that overcharging is not covered, but I couldn't find any people that had problems with that. Not sure how they would diagnose that either.

**Basically I wanna know what other warranty claims were honored or not honored** to get a better view of value of this warranty**.** To give you a few examples: SD/Sim Card suddenly not being recognized, speakers crackling up, phone restarting, etc.",samsung,2019-05-14 19:20:39

bp0r69,I'm aware that 1 year purchase warranty on international version of unlocked phones doesn't work in canada. I'm wondering if there's way to receive warranty on international unlocked phones.,samsung,2019-05-16 01:23:33
bp0wf1,"Just talked to a Verizon rep about getting a galaxy phone. I asked about using an alternative launcher and he said that he doesn't recommend that because he's seen people having sim card issues with those, and that if I had any issues with my phone I'd need to pay more to use the warranty. I clarified that I was asking about the rootless launcher and not rooting, but he stuck to his story. He said that when I tried to download the launcher from the app store that it would warn me. He seemed genuinely afraid of me downloading an alternative launcher on a Samsung phone, lol.


This is all false, right?",samsung,2019-05-16 01:35:03
bp1eho,"I bought mother in law galaxy s8 2 years ago. my mother in law rarely uses the phone as she responds to our messages like a half day later. One day she said the phone was out and took it to Samsung store and they said motherboard problem and needs replacement. But,  it requires $300 to fix it because it is out of warranty. 

&amp;#x200B;

I lost all my data when I used galaxy note 4 due to sudden death in the motherboard. I just thought it was a coincidence.

Now, this has happened to me twice and especially to the device that was very lightly used. I feel like this is a manufacturing defect. After reading Google is paying nexus 6P users $450 for faulty device, Can i get compensation for this case or at least free replacement ?",samsung,2019-05-16 02:15:23

bp39ci,"Apple headphones, the old ones with the flat mesh earpart, only playing out one ear? But still work everywhere else? Tried to set the settings to make it play out just the right one but it wouldn't. The headphones work perfectly tho. Is this just something rhat apple has done or samsung?",samsung,2019-05-16 04:42:35

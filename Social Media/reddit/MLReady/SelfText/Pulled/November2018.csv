**U**(OLED) **E**(Europe) **65**(Size) **LS003A U**(DVB-T2/C/S2) **XRU**(Rus)

L or LS suppose to be release year, its 17 I think, but 2017 is Q, MU or M. L is 2015, and there is no S or LS. Or Frame TV is 2015 model? If L is year why other letters not similar, they suppose to indicate TV Series, both TVs are Frame but letters pretty different.

9t4i8u,"The rear camera glass on my Note 9 shattered inside my pocket while it was in a case.  I was working construction and lifting heavy tables, so I understand how it may have broken.  Samsung tech support told me to go to uBreakiFix to replace the part for $59.99 USD.  However, the employees st the store told me that they are unable to offer silver replacement parts for repair.  They have all the other colors but in order to fix a silver device it needs to be sent to Samsung directly.  

The guy at the store agreed it was really stupid and that I was pretty much out of luck.  I switched from an iPhone due to issues with their build quality; I get that it could have happened to any phone, I'm just upset that it is such a difficult thing to remedy in this case.  I dont want to go without my $1000 phone for an extended time because Samsung is doing something ridiculous.  

What do you guys think of this, I need to call Samsung to see if they could possibly ship the silver part to the store itself.  However the employees never mentioned anything along those lines, it just seems obvious.

I've tried to decompile the firmware but without any success, I study electronics and informatic in an engineering school so knowing the microcontroller or the FPGA used as a scaler in the monitor could help me a lot, because if Samsung doesn't release a firmware where the overdrive can be disabled entierly, I don't see any other option than doing it myself. If someone found a way to fix that I take it with pleasure !

I do a complete factory reset.

I then researched around a bit until seeing a few MHL cables were decently priced. My question here is will this actually work? I want to make sure my investment won't be for nothing. My phone is a few years old (Samsung A3) so its been on my mind for a bit on whether or not it'll work.

And my god - this phone is brilliant. Gone is the crappy UI, and it's replaced with a cohesive, polished UI, that I actually prefer over stock android. I can disable the Samsung apps if I want. I don't even have to install most of the them. The ones I have tried, are actually good.

I sent my Galaxy S8 in for repair, and it was covered by warranty.

I didn't have to pay anything, and they sent me back a phone with a T-Mobile SIM card in it. I didn't think anything of it - popped the SIM card out, stuck it in my old iPhone 6+, and went on using my SIM card for my phone number that I took out prior to sending it off to Samsung.

Well, feeling nostalgic, I fired up my old iPhone and was greeted by a ""SIM LOCKED"" notification. I was just messing around, and put in ""0000"" to attempt to unlock the SIM, lo and behold it worked.

I've now sat here this morning fiddling around with settings, and I've found out that I can actually make phone calls. I've called a friend of mine and my workplace to test this out using WiFi Calling through T-Mobile, as I don't actually pick up T-Mobile service good where I live.

If I go into my settings on my iPhone, it says my cellular plan is **BIZ SC 2GB Data &amp; SMHS**.

As stated previously I can make calls, haven't tried texts yet, and I haven't been somewhere that I can pick up T-Mobile service to test it away from WiFi.

My questions are as follows:

*1. How does this T-Mobile SIM card work if I haven't paid for it?
2. Is this a mess-up on Samsung's part?
3. Do I need to contact them?
4. If I keep using this SIM, would I be responsible for charges associated with its use, even though Samsung sent it to me?*

I've had a Google Pixel for the last 2.5 years and I like the clean bloatware free interface. But since the only new feature I really wanted from the Pixel 3 was wireless charging, and the Pixel3 is nearly 1k, I decided to get a used mint condition s8 for a third the price.   


I have a  SM-G950U. It was sold to me as ""AT&amp;T unlocked"" which I thought meant that it was AT&amp;T compatible frequency but that there was no AT&amp;T bloatware on it. I was wrong.   


Is it possible to root the  SM-G950U reliably and get rid of the bloatware etc? (I might actually keep some of the Samsung stuff around since it seems pretty decent)  


Yes, I already know about disabling but I prefer to get rid of stuff entirely if possible.   


I also work as a UX Designer/Developer, and I have a decent amount of technical knowledge (though mostly with Ubuntu rather than Android), so I'm willing to put in some effort to get a better, cleaner, experience etc.   


From what I can tell from the threads it's pretty hard these days to root the  SM-G950U, but I thought I would check. Last thread I saw explicitly explaining why you shouldn't root was from nearly a year ago, and I figured things have probably changed. ",samsung,2018-11-03 23:13:47

I’m a noob to Android/Samsung products but I’m wondering if there’s a way to get a little Bluetooth remote for my tablet. I listen to music on it while driving, with my tablet being plugged in my car via aux cable. Since I can’t change or skip songs through buttons on my car, and I don’t like to open my device while driving, is there some sort of remote I could buy that would be able to help me change songs?

I don’t need anything crazy, just a simple remote with a button that would let me skip the track. FWIW, I use Spotify, and will typically queue up some songs/podcasts before driving. It would be nice to be able to skip the track while having my tablet case closed. 
Would also be nice to have something that I could leave in my car that pairs up automatically when I bring my tablet in.

I was wondering if there were any of you who who own a Note9 or a Tab S4, and do not need the exclusive skin for Fortnite.

First of all, you're probably wondering: *""Why are you requesting it here?""*

I'd recently spent a lot on repairs for my S7 Edge (~US$ 250) for the front display, home button and stuff attached to those. If required, as evidence, I can attach the invoice along with this post.

Initially, I did plan to purchase a new device, although I decided against it, as I had spent about 1/4 the cost of a new device already. Moreover, I'm still in college, so I cannot afford to go all out and risk not being able to pay for my fees.

I'm not asking anyone to go ahead and purchase a completely new device solely my sake; only if you already have one and are willing to lend me a hand in this.

It's that I really love the design of the skin and would like to own it in-game.

The only time I did spend money in-game is for the Battle Pass in Season 2, and Save the World (STW). Since then, I'd just save up the stuff I earn from STW by completing challenges and progressing, in order to spend on the future Passes or any cool stuff in the store.

Once again, I would really appreciate it if you could help me out. I believe the requirements are just to play 3 matches regular, on the device.

9uaqql,"I honestly don't browse the sub enough to know if this is already a thing and I'm way too lazy after working a double shift at a busy restaurant so,... Here goes.

I have owned an iPhone for the better part of a decade.  I adored my i6, something I kept in great condition for 3 years.  I honestly would have kept my iPhone forever if it wasn't so expensive to fix, even with having the option now without spending an exorbant amount of my hard earned money I would choose to keep my phone because I was so acustomed to using it.

That said, I absolutely adore this phone.  Everything about it - the amount of customization, screen and camera quality, especially the edge screen.  I am finally getting used to using an Android OS, and I gotta say,... As someone who is VERY particular about accessibility and convienence I am very impressed.  I honestly can't tell you if the things I enjoy are Android or Samsung related but I can tell you that the s9 is an amazing piece of technology and I am more than happy to shell out the $800 for what is quickly becoming an extension of my hands.  Plus it's shiny and pretty.  I'm a girl and I love glittery things but I'm positive 90% of you will agree with me on this - it's gorgeous. 

There are always downfalls - stupid shit like having the always on feature uncustomizable to be hooked up to the gravity sensor or the fact that I can't seem to master typing on this thing (having said that might just be something I need get used to after using the same phone with what I'm sure we're very diminished screen sensors).  The downfalls are so few and far between I honestly don't feel like they are even worth mentioning.

9udwqs,"I was in a T-Mobile store over the weekend and checked out the phones sitting out while I was there. All the major phones use AMOLED screens (LG V40 ThinQ, Galaxy S9/Note 9, iPhone XS) that are probably equally susceptible to burn-in. Of those, the Samsung phones are the only ones sitting on a static homescreen rather than reverting to a screensaver. And because of that even the new Note 9 has terrible screen burn-in while the iPhone XS, released just a month later, has none.

I don't believe that Samsung phones are any more susceptible to burn-in than other AMOLED phones, but the fact that LG and Apple use a screensaver on their display models certainly makes it appear as though this is an issue specific to Samsung devices. If I were looking at getting a Note 9 or an iPhone XS Max and saw that the Note 9 had terrible screen burn-in while the iPhone did not it would definitely sway my buying decision if I didn't understand the technology.

But now, when I click the remote, it turns on my Apple TV, my Samsung TV, but defaults to the TV PLUS app, on my TV Source. This is so annoying because now it forces me to use another remote, just to turn back the source. Is there a way to change this? Remove TV Plus?

They sent me pictures of a note 5 saying they are going to charge me $450 in 4 days. Instantly I opened a customer service chat and told them what was up. They asked for imei off the note 8 and I said I turned it in how am I supposed to get it. Then I remembered it's on the Samsung website under my devices. Gave them imei then they said they'll forward the information to the group that handles it and I'll shortly get an email. 

I did this same trade in program for a previous phone and it was flawless. Sucks that this experience makes me not want to deal with Samsung despite having pretty solid phones. 

So if this doesn't go through I'm paying full price for a note 9 and out a note 8, essentially making this a ~$1500 phone.  Dafaq!

9v01du,"I'm wondering about Samsung phones with that curved screen edge on the long sides. Has this been a problem for you in a drop?

Obviously drops on uneven surfaces are a crapshoot for any phone in any case. So let's assume a flat surface.

Any case I've ever seen leaves these 2 edges somewhat exposed, to not cover the screen. I know that the top and bottom case lips are supposed to protect the edges. Still, it seems like there are more ""unlucky"" drop scenarios (even on flat surfaces) with the curved screen edge than without. I also feel like I need to get a more protective case (e.g. Otterbox Defender) than I would with other phones.

A tempered glass screen protector would help, of course, but it seems like all I hear about is people complaining about them - rainbows, bubbles, spiderwebs, popping off after a fall, ... With previous phones I've therefore just gotten a film for scratch resistance, and a good case for drop protection. But maybe I need to rethink that here.

9v498n,"Back a couple of years ago we got a demonstration at CES from Dolby Vision HDR.  It was phenomenal, but the prototype TV they used was much brighter in Nits than current TVs on the market.  This was not on the show floor, but in a private area.  With this prototype TV, an airplane with an aluminum skin was flying and caught the reflection of sunlight.  You almost had to look away.  HDR really makes things come alive.  

Currently we see the latest QLED Samsung TVs with 1500 nits (some report as high as 2,000 nits), which is a big improvement over previous versions.  Standard HDTVs in the past were much dimmer.  OLED is still dimmer than QLED, so you would think that in regard to HDR that Samsung QLED would have the edge.  But OLED is still the winner in blacks and contrast. 

The Dolby Vision standard can handle 4,000 nits brightness, with future plans to support up to 10,000 nits.

Anyone want to comment on the current state of HDR and what you think is better technology, OLED or QLED Quantum Dot.  How bright can the TVs get before they have adverse impact on vision (blue light, etc.)?

However I'm looking to connect to a monitor and use Dex. I've got a couple of USB-C hubs, however when I use these I get a message noting ""Samsung Dex not avalaible while cover open"".

I do have the Samsung keyboard cover, so I've tried closing that same result.

Having done some more reading I'm coming to thhe conlusion that I can't use a hub but will need a straight USB-C to HDMI, quite possibly the offical Samsung one. However in any situation where I'd want to be connnected to a monitor I'm likely to be there some time so being able to charge at the same time would be nice as would being able to plug in some peripherals. Screen mirroring kinda does the job but feels like a let down.

Am I missing something? My searches thusfar haven't turned up much. I'm not too happy with the prospect of having to get another USB-C hub, especially a Samsung one (As they seem outragously epennsive - £30 for  just the USB-C to HDMI one, £64 for the Tab Pro S multiport adaptor) but if thats whats needed. . .

I can use Dolby Digital with some content, and I connect my actually functional blu ray player directly to my speaker setup one for DVD and Blu-Ray. But for a lot of games and streaming, I can only use PCM and DTS Neo, and I significantly prefer to have the surround upmixing of DTS Neo.

9veerh,"I just need a 55"" tv for my living room. I'm in a medium sized apartment so I don't need anything bigger than that. I play games occasionally on my PS4 Pro but I'm not a hardcore gamer. I mainly watch tv and movies. 

On Samsung's website with my student discount I can get the Q6 for $899.99, the Q7 for $1,199.99, or the Q8 for $1299.99. Which one would you recommend for my sort of basic needs? 

Also would you recommend I pay it outright or take advantage of the Samsung financing? I can afford to pay it outright but already have an account open with them and figured why not. The Q6 would be $75/month for 12 months, Q7 would be $100/month for 12 months, and the Q8 would be $36.11 for 36 months.

Final question. Would you go with their extended warranty? This would be my first pricey tv so I just want to make sure going with them would be a good choice.

9vk71l,"One UI is a new development out of left field for most of us. This is something we have grown to know but dismissed as something that was not possible as the norm is UI elements the way it is. I give Samsung BIG KUDOS for recognizing this and being the first to implement this new approach that is One UI.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I loved when the Macintosh first came out was the User Interface guidelines Apple set forth. NO longer does Apple really do this or enforce this.  Application developers needed to adhere to a simple structure so all apps looks and works similar back then. This approach helped the end user ""know"" how to use any application they encountered. Nowadays that is no longer true and on all OSes it is the ""anything goes"" approach. Apple decided to not do this anymore and lost a key part of itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

iOS 12 for example:

\- Phone app - Keypad is on the bottom (good) , but if you go into any other screen (Favorites, Recent, Contacts, Voicemail) you see elements you need to get to the top to select something else. One UI fixes this.

\- Notes, Reminders, Calendar - All suffer from elements at the top and bottom, not just at the bottom where it is easy to reach. One UI fixes this.

\- I could go on but you get the idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Samsung Experience 9.5 for example:

\- Phone - everything is at the top except for the + icon in the lower bottom right. One UI fixes this.

\- Notes, Calendar, Clock - All suffer from elements at the top. One UI Fixes this.

\- I could go on but you get the idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today with One UI - yes, One UI is different but in a good way.  I believe this is the next UI approach for mobile that every company (including APPLE) will adopt in their own way. But Samsung will be the FIRST (that I have seen). 

&amp;#x200B;

If you believe in Samsung's One UI mission like I do - please upvote this.  This makes me more excited about my Note9 when One UI is released in January 2019!",samsung,2018-11-09 12:57:25
9vknz5,"Hello

I bought my Samsung S8 SM-G950U from Samsung it was a TMobile carrier phone for the USA.  Then I moved to Europe. When I reboot the phone is still has the TMobile sign on which is fine with me....a little taste of home as I moved to Switzerland.  But the guts are giving me a few issues.

1- Samsung Pay is wanting US zip codes and I do have a credit card from the US in the phone and it works fine but I cannot add a European credit card apparently as Samsung Pay does not allow it on a US phone?  Any help here?

2- Several apps report back to me that I am not in the correct nation despite being in the correct nation.  Ironically this is seen in a potential credit card replacement app the European bank uses.  So I cannot use Samsung Pay nor TWINT which is the approved app for the new bank.  Any help here?

3- FM here had different spacing...in the US it is 200khz as 94.1 94.3 94.5.  But in Europe it is 100khz as 94.0 94.1 94.2 94.3.  Is there a way to change the FM spacing on the phone?  Any help here?

I'm seriously going to explode using this stupid thing one day, because it's so, SO, annoying. I haven't had this problem for a month after I bought this, and after that, it started happening. The first time it happened, I just thought it was a bug and ignored it. It didn't happen  again for a few weeks. Then, it happened again, but I still ignored it. After a few weeks, it happened AGAIN. Then it started happening more often. So what happened TODAY is that I was playing on my tablet, then it turned off. I turned it back on, and 20 secs later, it happened. After an amount of time, (I couldn't remember how many times it happened) it happened again and again. Then, it started getting worse. It turned itself off, so I turned it on. But 1 sec later, it turned off again. It kept repeating for like 3 times, and after THAT, it became just absolutely ridiculous. It turned itself off, as you probably guessed.

9w5jzy,"Hello. I need a new smartphone and I have to admit, I'd like to try a Sony this time. However, there's the A8 2018 which costs around 270€ (Italy) and ticks lots of boxes. There are three things I'm concerned with:

&amp;#x200B;

1. How's the battery life? It scores rather good on Gsmarena, but I'd like to hear it from daily owners.
2. How's the audio quality with headphones? I listen to music a lot on my phone, that's basically why I'm oriented towards a Sony.
3. How's the bloatware on it? I hate it when they put useless apps that I can only disable. I remember trying an A8 in a shop and I couldn't even uninstall games on it like Cut the Rope (which is quite heavy as well).
4. Anything else I should be aware of? I'm reading of an audio bug where the speaker goes off for some time. Moreover, here in Italy, Samsung and Apple have been fined for planned obsolescence (basically updates that intentionally slow your phone down). How's the situation on that?

Thanks!",samsung,2018-11-11 17:22:56

It used to be decent, but has slowly progressed into a larger and deeper cesspool over the years. But most of the current annoying glitches have seemed to magically form over the past month. 

I can remember back when I could actually use messages in the browser. Unfortunately they stripped that a long time ago, getting more users to download their bloated, ad-infested app instead. So, I'll go ahead and bring that up with the new annoyances with browsing Facebook on mobile, cause why the fuck not. 

Next up, is when I try to use a react on comments. 98% of the time I try to like a comment and emote my ANGER on a post I DISLIKE and instead, I end up LIKING it and I can't change it. Granted, it hasn't been that bad lately, but occasionally I get that bug and it iritates the bejesus outta me. 

Then, although this hasn't bothered me as much, but it still pisses me off, is when I go to read comments or view a certain group/page... The damn top bar becomes useless. I can no longer check my notifications. Instead, it's just a banner with the group/pages post I'm currently viewing.

But now, the ultimate frustration of using Facebook on mobile is the CONSTANT page freezing and app crashing when trying to go BACK on a comment thread or post. It happens EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I try to go back from a comment section of a post I'm reading. I hit back and it FREEZES then CRASHES. I just love unresponsive web pages.

So basically Samsung wanted her to pay them for an engineer to unlock her tablet which I assume is quite expensive and come up with a proof of purchase for a 5 year old tablet!

Result: she found out how to factory reset it herself online and the whole process wqs very simple and took 5 minutes.

I asked them why they wouldn't just tell me that from the beginning and there was some nonsense given about a Google account on the device requiring a sign in even in the event of a factory reset (the issue was the password to unlock the tablet on startup).

I obviously went with the latter option since I wasn't gonna be phone-less for a week or longer &amp; it's only a half hour drive to the nearest UBreakIFix from here.

Brought the phone in, he asked me to show him the burn-in &amp; since it's not visible without looking for it, I pulled up whitedisplay.com ( if you don't know about that site, it's very useful for seeing any burn-in your screen has ), once he seen it we were good to go.

9x58k7,"I hope this is ok to post here. I had a Samsung Galaxy S7. In the past few months I've had major issues with software but I figured it being a 2 1/2 year old phone, it was bound to have issues. The biggest issue was that I couldn't answer 90% of my incoming calls. I could hear the phone ring but the call answer screen wouldn't come up so I'd have to wait for it to go to VM then call them back from the call log. 
I finally got fed up and bought a Galaxy J7. I've had it for 3 days and now it is doing the EXACT SAME THING! I'm in sales so missing calls is not good for my paycheck. 
I have the Fitbit Versa connected but it started on the S7 before I got the Versa. I actually got the Versa bc sometimes it would let me answer on the watch when it wouldn't let me answer on the phone. I still have the issue if I disconnect the Versa.

Basically, I have a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge that started having this issue with the port USB. Basically, it detects moisture every time I connect it to a charger—even if I'm completely sure there is no moisture in there actually—so it's ended up running out of battery completely and it's dead at the moment.

According to what I have read, a wireless charger would be able to resurrect the phone, but I have no idea about wireless chargers. Are they universal? Is it just as simple as putting the phone on top of the thing and it will start charging? Will I need a special case or any other additional complement to use the wireless charger? Any suggestions?

I obviously went with the latter option since I wasn't gonna be phone-less for a week or longer &amp; it's only a half hour drive to the nearest UBreakIFix from here.

Brought the phone in, he asked me to show him the burn-in &amp; since it's not visible without looking for it, I pulled up whitedisplay.com ( if you don't know about that site, it's very useful for seeing any burn-in your screen has ), once he seen it we were good to go.

I have a Galaxy S6 Active which I bought New In Box (despite it being an outdated model, I really prefer the active series) in January of 2018 for use with Cricket. This phone has given me a ton of weird, annoying problems(like where the screen FELL OFF(not as a result of drops/damage) and nobody can fix it since it's an ""Active"" series.)

 

My current issue is that I'm unable to update the software. It's currently running Android version 5.0.2,and when I try to update via the settings or SmartSwitch app, it says it's up to date. Mind you, according to AT&amp;T's website, the S6 active can be updated to 7.0.1, so it's not like it's just TOO old for anything newer than Android 5. Does anyone know any backdoor ways I can update the software so I can continue using certain apps?

 

What I've done already: Spoken to Samsung support ~5 times. They recommended I take it to UbreakIfix, which is their official repair center. There, they informed me they're unable to work on the hardware because it's an Active device that Samsung will Soon(TM) be sending them the equipment to work on. After leaving it there for a few hours, I come back and they tell me they can't update the software because ???????... Samsung Support tells me next to take it to the Samsung Mobile people in Best Buy. I go there, and they tell me ""Lol no we can't do that, it's an older device so you're shit outta' luck."" Even after all that and being faulty in several ways, Samsung says they CANNOT send a replacement under any circumstances whatsoever, and I'd have to send it out for repair and be without a phone for 3-5 weeks(which basically means I have to buy a new phone since I need it for work).

I never, well rarely, have the GPS Location option turned on and activated. I turn it on occasionally if I'm going to a new address or on a road trip, but not during my general everyday activities. I have the Samsung Pay app installed. Several months ago when I got the phone I set it up far enough to add a credit card that I never use. Really just kind of seeing what the app was all about and if it was something I could use. Obviously didn't want to put my debit card info on a new app I know nothing about. Anyway, after that, I have never used the app or even opened it. Never got a notification or anything.

So today I go into GameStop to get a Wii game for my daughter. Location services and wifi is turned off, only cell data is on. I buy the game using a debit card not connected in anyway to Samsung pay or any other pay app on my phone. Don't even have the bank app but sometimes access my account on my phones browser.  Literally as soon as I step out of the store I get a notification from Samsung pay with an offer to purchase a GameStop gift card at a 10% discount.

Question is how did the app know I was there? Strictly through picking up my location through cell data? I did search GameStop on my browser about 6 hours earlier trying to figure out if I could search a stores used game inventory (I couldn't from what I could tell).  Is the app crawling through my browsing history? Or did it just know my location through cell data?

I also had a strange experience with the note 5 several months ago. I was texting a friend through the signal messaging app about his job at a mattress store. Just one text asking if he was still working there. I hadn't talked to him in a while and just making conversation. I never searched mattresses online or anything.

They have all the other colors but in order to fix a silver device it needs to be sent to Samsung directly.  

The guy at the store agreed it was really stupid and that I was pretty much out of luck.

I then researched around a bit until seeing a few MHL cables were decently priced. My question here is will this actually work? I want to make sure my investment won't be for nothing. My phone is a few years old (Samsung A3) so its been on my mind for a bit on whether or not it'll work.

Having become an avid android auto user, I needed a phone that worked perfectly with AA, and the only brand to reliably do that, is Samsung. So I was kind of forced to buy the S9+.

And my god - this phone is brilliant. Gone is the crappy UI, and it's replaced with a cohesive, polished UI, that I actually prefer over stock android. I can disable the Samsung apps if I want. I don't even have to install most of the them. The ones I have tried, are actually good.

The build quality is great. The screen is great. It's got a headphone jack, Qi charging, waterproof etc. I love the ""always on"" display, great feature. The notification light can be controlled, unlike on my Huawei. Hands down the best phone I have tried! It seems like Samsung have finally understood that functionality is equally important to design. Also the fingerprint reader is so much better than on the S8, that I briefly tried.

I sent my Galaxy S8 in for repair, and it was covered by warranty.

I didn't have to pay anything, and they sent me back a phone with a T-Mobile SIM card in it. I didn't think anything of it - popped the SIM card out, stuck it in my old iPhone 6+, and went on using my SIM card for my phone number that I took out prior to sending it off to Samsung.

Well, feeling nostalgic, I fired up my old iPhone and was greeted by a ""SIM LOCKED"" notification. I was just messing around, and put in ""0000"" to attempt to unlock the SIM, lo and behold it worked.

I've now sat here this morning fiddling around with settings, and I've found out that I can actually make phone calls. I've called a friend of mine and my workplace to test this out using WiFi Calling through T-Mobile, as I don't actually pick up T-Mobile service good where I live.

If I go into my settings on my iPhone, it says my cellular plan is **BIZ SC 2GB Data &amp; SMHS**.

As stated previously I can make calls, haven't tried texts yet, and I haven't been somewhere that I can pick up T-Mobile service to test it away from WiFi.

My questions are as follows:

*1. How does this T-Mobile SIM card work if I haven't paid for it?
2. Is this a mess-up on Samsung's part?
3. Do I need to contact them?
4. If I keep using this SIM, would I be responsible for charges associated with its use, even though Samsung sent it to me?*

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to purchase a Samsung View tablet tonight, and am wondering if anyone can present any possibles scams I should look out for. Yesterday, I bought an iPad Mini 4 which seemed to be restored but had an activation lock. No chance at getting my money back as they were obviously going to buy drugs. So, I really would like not to get scammed again but from my understanding there isn't any permanent locks on androids.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I should look out for? and if so, what steps need to be taken to verify I'm not getting scammed?

I've had a Google Pixel for the last 2.5 years and I like the clean bloatware free interface. But since the only new feature I really wanted from the Pixel 3 was wireless charging, and the Pixel3 is nearly 1k, I decided to get a used mint condition s8 for a third the price.   


I have a  SM-G950U. It was sold to me as ""AT&amp;T unlocked"" which I thought meant that it was AT&amp;T compatible frequency but that there was no AT&amp;T bloatware on it. I was wrong.   


Is it possible to root the  SM-G950U reliably and get rid of the bloatware etc? (I might actually keep some of the Samsung stuff around since it seems pretty decent)  


Yes, I already know about disabling but I prefer to get rid of stuff entirely if possible.   


I also work as a UX Designer/Developer, and I have a decent amount of technical knowledge (though mostly with Ubuntu rather than Android), so I'm willing to put in some effort to get a better, cleaner, experience etc.

I’m a noob to Android/Samsung products but I’m wondering if there’s a way to get a little Bluetooth remote for my tablet. I listen to music on it while driving, with my tablet being plugged in my car via aux cable. Since I can’t change or skip songs through buttons on my car, and I don’t like to open my device while driving, is there some sort of remote I could buy that would be able to help me change songs?

I don’t need anything crazy, just a simple remote with a button that would let me skip the track. FWIW, I use Spotify, and will typically queue up some songs/podcasts before driving. It would be nice to be able to skip the track while having my tablet case closed. 
Would also be nice to have something that I could leave in my car that pairs up automatically when I bring my tablet in.

I was wondering if there were any of you who who own a Note9 or a Tab S4, and do not need the exclusive skin for Fortnite.

First of all, you're probably wondering: *""Why are you requesting it here?""*

I'd recently spent a lot on repairs for my S7 Edge (~US$ 250) for the front display, home button and stuff attached to those. If required, as evidence, I can attach the invoice along with this post.

Initially, I did plan to purchase a new device, although I decided against it, as I had spent about 1/4 the cost of a new device already. Moreover, I'm still in college, so I cannot afford to go all out and risk not being able to pay for my fees.

I'm not asking anyone to go ahead and purchase a completely new device solely my sake; only if you already have one and are willing to lend me a hand in this.

It's that I really love the design of the skin and would like to own it in-game.

The only time I did spend money in-game is for the Battle Pass in Season 2, and Save the World (STW). Since then, I'd just save up the stuff I earn from STW by completing challenges and progressing, in order to spend on the future Passes or any cool stuff in the store.

Once again, I would really appreciate it if you could help me out. I believe the requirements are just to play 3 matches regular, on the device.

I have owned an iPhone for the better part of a decade.  I adored my i6, something I kept in great condition for 3 years.  I honestly would have kept my iPhone forever if it wasn't so expensive to fix, even with having the option now without spending an exorbant amount of my hard earned money I would choose to keep my phone because I was so acustomed to using it.

That said, I absolutely adore this phone.  Everything about it - the amount of customization, screen and camera quality, especially the edge screen.  I am finally getting used to using an Android OS, and I gotta say,... As someone who is VERY particular about accessibility and convienence I am very impressed.  I honestly can't tell you if the things I enjoy are Android or Samsung related but I can tell you that the s9 is an amazing piece of technology and I am more than happy to shell out the $800 for what is quickly becoming an extension of my hands.  Plus it's shiny and pretty.  I'm a girl and I love glittery things but I'm positive 90% of you will agree with me on this - it's gorgeous. 

There are always downfalls - stupid shit like having the always on feature uncustomizable to be hooked up to the gravity sensor or the fact that I can't seem to master typing on this thing (having said that might just be something I need get used to after using the same phone with what I'm sure we're very diminished screen sensors).  The downfalls are so few and far between I honestly don't feel like they are even worth mentioning.

9udwqs,"I was in a T-Mobile store over the weekend and checked out the phones sitting out while I was there. All the major phones use AMOLED screens (LG V40 ThinQ, Galaxy S9/Note 9, iPhone XS) that are probably equally susceptible to burn-in. Of those, the Samsung phones are the only ones sitting on a static homescreen rather than reverting to a screensaver. And because of that even the new Note 9 has terrible screen burn-in while the iPhone XS, released just a month later, has none.

I don't believe that Samsung phones are any more susceptible to burn-in than other AMOLED phones, but the fact that LG and Apple use a screensaver on their display models certainly makes it appear as though this is an issue specific to Samsung devices. If I were looking at getting a Note 9 or an iPhone XS Max and saw that the Note 9 had terrible screen burn-in while the iPhone did not it would definitely sway my buying decision if I didn't understand the technology.

They asked for imei off the note 8 and I said I turned it in how am I supposed to get it. Then I remembered it's on the Samsung website under my devices. Gave them imei then they said they'll forward the information to the group that handles it and I'll shortly get an email. 

I did this same trade in program for a previous phone and it was flawless. Sucks that this experience makes me not want to deal with Samsung despite having pretty solid phones.

9v01du,"I'm wondering about Samsung phones with that curved screen edge on the long sides. Has this been a problem for you in a drop?

Obviously drops on uneven surfaces are a crapshoot for any phone in any case. So let's assume a flat surface.

Any case I've ever seen leaves these 2 edges somewhat exposed, to not cover the screen. I know that the top and bottom case lips are supposed to protect the edges. Still, it seems like there are more ""unlucky"" drop scenarios (even on flat surfaces) with the curved screen edge than without. I also feel like I need to get a more protective case (e.g. Otterbox Defender) than I would with other phones.

A tempered glass screen protector would help, of course, but it seems like all I hear about is people complaining about them - rainbows, bubbles, spiderwebs, popping off after a fall, ... With previous phones I've therefore just gotten a film for scratch resistance, and a good case for drop protection. But maybe I need to rethink that here.

9v498n,"Back a couple of years ago we got a demonstration at CES from Dolby Vision HDR.  It was phenomenal, but the prototype TV they used was much brighter in Nits than current TVs on the market.  This was not on the show floor, but in a private area.  With this prototype TV, an airplane with an aluminum skin was flying and caught the reflection of sunlight.  You almost had to look away.  HDR really makes things come alive.  

Currently we see the latest QLED Samsung TVs with 1500 nits (some report as high as 2,000 nits), which is a big improvement over previous versions.  Standard HDTVs in the past were much dimmer.  OLED is still dimmer than QLED, so you would think that in regard to HDR that Samsung QLED would have the edge.  But OLED is still the winner in blacks and contrast. 

The Dolby Vision standard can handle 4,000 nits brightness, with future plans to support up to 10,000 nits.

Anyone want to comment on the current state of HDR and what you think is better technology, OLED or QLED Quantum Dot.  How bright can the TVs get before they have adverse impact on vision (blue light, etc.)?

However I'm looking to connect to a monitor and use Dex. I've got a couple of USB-C hubs, however when I use these I get a message noting ""Samsung Dex not avalaible while cover open"".

I do have the Samsung keyboard cover, so I've tried closing that same result.

Having done some more reading I'm coming to thhe conlusion that I can't use a hub but will need a straight USB-C to HDMI, quite possibly the offical Samsung one. However in any situation where I'd want to be connnected to a monitor I'm likely to be there some time so being able to charge at the same time would be nice as would being able to plug in some peripherals. Screen mirroring kinda does the job but feels like a let down.

Am I missing something? My searches thusfar haven't turned up much. I'm not too happy with the prospect of having to get another USB-C hub, especially a Samsung one (As they seem outragously epennsive - £30 for  just the USB-C to HDMI one, £64 for the Tab Pro S multiport adaptor) but if thats whats needed. . .

I can use Dolby Digital with some content, and I connect my actually functional blu ray player directly to my speaker setup one for DVD and Blu-Ray. But for a lot of games and streaming, I can only use PCM and DTS Neo, and I significantly prefer to have the surround upmixing of DTS Neo.

On Samsung's website with my student discount I can get the Q6 for $899.99, the Q7 for $1,199.99, or the Q8 for $1299.99. Which one would you recommend for my sort of basic needs? 

Also would you recommend I pay it outright or take advantage of the Samsung financing? I can afford to pay it outright but already have an account open with them and figured why not. The Q6 would be $75/month for 12 months, Q7 would be $100/month for 12 months, and the Q8 would be $36.11 for 36 months.

Final question. Would you go with their extended warranty? This would be my first pricey tv so I just want to make sure going with them would be a good choice.

9vk71l,"One UI is a new development out of left field for most of us. This is something we have grown to know but dismissed as something that was not possible as the norm is UI elements the way it is. I give Samsung BIG KUDOS for recognizing this and being the first to implement this new approach that is One UI.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I loved when the Macintosh first came out was the User Interface guidelines Apple set forth. NO longer does Apple really do this or enforce this.  Application developers needed to adhere to a simple structure so all apps looks and works similar back then. This approach helped the end user ""know"" how to use any application they encountered. Nowadays that is no longer true and on all OSes it is the ""anything goes"" approach. Apple decided to not do this anymore and lost a key part of itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

iOS 12 for example:

\- Phone app - Keypad is on the bottom (good) , but if you go into any other screen (Favorites, Recent, Contacts, Voicemail) you see elements you need to get to the top to select something else. One UI fixes this.

\- Notes, Reminders, Calendar - All suffer from elements at the top and bottom, not just at the bottom where it is easy to reach. One UI fixes this.

\- I could go on but you get the idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Samsung Experience 9.5 for example:

\- Phone - everything is at the top except for the + icon in the lower bottom right. One UI fixes this.

\- Notes, Calendar, Clock - All suffer from elements at the top. One UI Fixes this.

\- I could go on but you get the idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today with One UI - yes, One UI is different but in a good way.  I believe this is the next UI approach for mobile that every company (including APPLE) will adopt in their own way. But Samsung will be the FIRST (that I have seen). 

&amp;#x200B;

If you believe in Samsung's One UI mission like I do - please upvote this.  This makes me more excited about my Note9 when One UI is released in January 2019!",samsung,2018-11-09 12:57:25
9vknz5,"Hello

I bought my Samsung S8 SM-G950U from Samsung it was a TMobile carrier phone for the USA.  Then I moved to Europe. When I reboot the phone is still has the TMobile sign on which is fine with me....a little taste of home as I moved to Switzerland.  But the guts are giving me a few issues.

1- Samsung Pay is wanting US zip codes and I do have a credit card from the US in the phone and it works fine but I cannot add a European credit card apparently as Samsung Pay does not allow it on a US phone?  Any help here?

2- Several apps report back to me that I am not in the correct nation despite being in the correct nation.  Ironically this is seen in a potential credit card replacement app the European bank uses.  So I cannot use Samsung Pay nor TWINT which is the approved app for the new bank.  Any help here?

3- FM here had different spacing...in the US it is 200khz as 94.1 94.3 94.5.  But in Europe it is 100khz as 94.0 94.1 94.2 94.3.  Is there a way to change the FM spacing on the phone?  Any help here?

Then it started happening more often. So what happened TODAY is that I was playing on my tablet, then it turned off. I turned it back on, and 20 secs later, it happened. After an amount of time, (I couldn't remember how many times it happened) it happened again and again. Then, it started getting worse. It turned itself off, so I turned it on. But 1 sec later, it turned off again. It kept repeating for like 3 times, and after THAT, it became just absolutely ridiculous. It turned itself off, as you probably guessed.

9w5jzy,"Hello. I need a new smartphone and I have to admit, I'd like to try a Sony this time. However, there's the A8 2018 which costs around 270€ (Italy) and ticks lots of boxes. There are three things I'm concerned with:

&amp;#x200B;

1. How's the battery life? It scores rather good on Gsmarena, but I'd like to hear it from daily owners.
2. How's the audio quality with headphones? I listen to music a lot on my phone, that's basically why I'm oriented towards a Sony.
3. How's the bloatware on it? I hate it when they put useless apps that I can only disable. I remember trying an A8 in a shop and I couldn't even uninstall games on it like Cut the Rope (which is quite heavy as well).
4. Anything else I should be aware of? I'm reading of an audio bug where the speaker goes off for some time. Moreover, here in Italy, Samsung and Apple have been fined for planned obsolescence (basically updates that intentionally slow your phone down). How's the situation on that?

It used to be decent, but has slowly progressed into a larger and deeper cesspool over the years. But most of the current annoying glitches have seemed to magically form over the past month. 

I can remember back when I could actually use messages in the browser. Unfortunately they stripped that a long time ago, getting more users to download their bloated, ad-infested app instead. So, I'll go ahead and bring that up with the new annoyances with browsing Facebook on mobile, cause why the fuck not. 

Next up, is when I try to use a react on comments. 98% of the time I try to like a comment and emote my ANGER on a post I DISLIKE and instead, I end up LIKING it and I can't change it. Granted, it hasn't been that bad lately, but occasionally I get that bug and it iritates the bejesus outta me. 

Then, although this hasn't bothered me as much, but it still pisses me off, is when I go to read comments or view a certain group/page... The damn top bar becomes useless. I can no longer check my notifications. Instead, it's just a banner with the group/pages post I'm currently viewing.

But now, the ultimate frustration of using Facebook on mobile is the CONSTANT page freezing and app crashing when trying to go BACK on a comment thread or post. It happens EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I try to go back from a comment section of a post I'm reading. I hit back and it FREEZES then CRASHES. I just love unresponsive web pages.

So basically Samsung wanted her to pay them for an engineer to unlock her tablet which I assume is quite expensive and come up with a proof of purchase for a 5 year old tablet!

Result: she found out how to factory reset it herself online and the whole process wqs very simple and took 5 minutes.

I asked them why they wouldn't just tell me that from the beginning and there was some nonsense given about a Google account on the device requiring a sign in even in the event of a factory reset (the issue was the password to unlock the tablet on startup).

In the past few months I've had major issues with software but I figured it being a 2 1/2 year old phone, it was bound to have issues.

I could hear the phone ring but the call answer screen wouldn't come up so I'd have to wait for it to go to VM then call them back from the call log. 
I finally got fed up and bought a Galaxy J7. I've had it for 3 days and now it is doing the EXACT SAME THING! I'm in sales so missing calls is not good for my paycheck.

I have a Galaxy S6 Active which I bought New In Box (despite it being an outdated model, I really prefer the active series) in January of 2018 for use with Cricket. This phone has given me a ton of weird, annoying problems(like where the screen FELL OFF(not as a result of drops/damage) and nobody can fix it since it's an ""Active"" series.)

 

My current issue is that I'm unable to update the software. It's currently running Android version 5.0.2,and when I try to update via the settings or SmartSwitch app, it says it's up to date. Mind you, according to AT&amp;T's website, the S6 active can be updated to 7.0.1, so it's not like it's just TOO old for anything newer than Android 5. Does anyone know any backdoor ways I can update the software so I can continue using certain apps?

 

What I've done already: Spoken to Samsung support ~5 times. They recommended I take it to UbreakIfix, which is their official repair center. There, they informed me they're unable to work on the hardware because it's an Active device that Samsung will Soon(TM) be sending them the equipment to work on. After leaving it there for a few hours, I come back and they tell me they can't update the software because ???????... Samsung Support tells me next to take it to the Samsung Mobile people in Best Buy. I go there, and they tell me ""Lol no we can't do that, it's an older device so you're shit outta' luck."" Even after all that and being faulty in several ways, Samsung says they CANNOT send a replacement under any circumstances whatsoever, and I'd have to send it out for repair and be without a phone for 3-5 weeks(which basically means I have to buy a new phone since I need it for work).

I never, well rarely, have the GPS Location option turned on and activated. I turn it on occasionally if I'm going to a new address or on a road trip, but not during my general everyday activities. I have the Samsung Pay app installed. Several months ago when I got the phone I set it up far enough to add a credit card that I never use. Really just kind of seeing what the app was all about and if it was something I could use. Obviously didn't want to put my debit card info on a new app I know nothing about. Anyway, after that, I have never used the app or even opened it. Never got a notification or anything.

So today I go into GameStop to get a Wii game for my daughter. Location services and wifi is turned off, only cell data is on. I buy the game using a debit card not connected in anyway to Samsung pay or any other pay app on my phone. Don't even have the bank app but sometimes access my account on my phones browser.  Literally as soon as I step out of the store I get a notification from Samsung pay with an offer to purchase a GameStop gift card at a 10% discount.

Question is how did the app know I was there? Strictly through picking up my location through cell data? I did search GameStop on my browser about 6 hours earlier trying to figure out if I could search a stores used game inventory (I couldn't from what I could tell).  Is the app crawling through my browsing history? Or did it just know my location through cell data?

I also had a strange experience with the note 5 several months ago. I was texting a friend through the signal messaging app about his job at a mattress store. Just one text asking if he was still working there. I hadn't talked to him in a while and just making conversation. I never searched mattresses online or anything.

9xvc0o,"Hi all

I recently have a chance to try on the Samsung S3 Frontier watch of my friend for few days and I feel it's is a decent watch even compare to Apple watch. I just want to know is it still worth it to buy since there is a new Galaxy watch out too.

Thanks all",samsung,2018-11-17 10:11:26

Thanks :D

9y1yyq,I have a very old samsung smart tv with smarthub.I think its a fh6200 model and i was wondering if there is a way to cast video from my phone to my tv.There is an app called tv cast and i have followed the instructions (inserting ip on the tv app) but it hasn't worked for me.Does this have to do with my tv not supporting this sort of casting or could i do something to fix it?,samsung,2018-11-18 01:23:25
9y23sl,"Title says it all. I’m switching from an iPhone 6s and have decided on an S9+. I’m on ATT and am going to buy it out right from Samsung as I don’t think ATT had any deals. I can buy it for $639. Those that have experience with Samsung’s Black Friday and cyber Monday deals, what would you suggest?",samsung,2018-11-18 01:43:13
9y2kdv,"I bought this tv yesterday from best buy's black Friday sale. I will be watching YouTube or just browsing my collection and no matter what it turns off after 15 mins. It doesn't turn off when watching the Apple TV just the htpc. 

All the Eco settings are turned off. I have the Apple TV and htpc going into a receiver which goes to HDMI 1 on the tv.

Why would it be turning off like this? It didn't happen with the LG I had before.",samsung,2018-11-18 02:52:52

9y3lo2,I heard from other posts and websites that Samsung is planning on releasing the Gear IconX for 2019 an even better version then the 2018 version is this true or are all of those posts and websites just hoaxes ,samsung,2018-11-18 05:38:28

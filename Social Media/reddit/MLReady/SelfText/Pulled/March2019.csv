avspch,"I pre-ordered the Galaxy S10+ and have been on the hunt for a decent quality case to use with it that doesn't destroy the aesthetics of my new phone. I figured that looking into the official Samsung brand cases might be my best option.

The Green Galaxy S10+ S-View Flip Cover case really caught my eye. I originally wanted to get the Prism Green version, but as we all now know it's not available in the US. On top of the S-View case looking really sleek and allowing me to see the time without having to expose my screen, it comes in that green color that I was after.

It's significantly pricier than any other phone case I have used in the past though. I just wanted to know if anyone around here had any experience with the S-View cases and could tell me if they are worth the money on looks, feel, and build quality.

I'm not really interested in drop protection promises. I mainly use cases to protect against scratches on the back of my phone.",samsung,2019-02-28 16:01:57

I’m wondering if the note 8 is gonna get the One UI update. I like the way it looks and would like to buy it if it’s going to get the update. The phone is Verizon branded if that makes a difference. ,samsung,2019-02-28 21:21:45
avwoik,"This post is my original thread from Verizon detailing my situation:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/anpaym/anyone\_had\_an\_issue\_purchasing\_a\_samsung\_phone/](https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/anpaym/anyone_had_an_issue_purchasing_a_samsung_phone/)

TL;dr: Ordered a Note 9 last August for launch day delivery from Samsung directly. Chose Verizon carrier financing. Received phone, activated, been using it for last 6 months. A couple weeks ago, Samsung notified that Verizon apparently denied financing and thus I have to either pay the entire cost in a lump sum or return the phone. Checked with Verizon, they have no record of the attempt to finance. Samsung partially admits it's their fault (""we are upgrading our systems to prevent this issue"") but is providing me absolutely no consideration or help.

Have talked with multiple Samsung reps both by phone and via Email and each time I get ""Someone will get back to you"" but nobody does.

Samsung claims:

* They need the Note 9 back, **in original box with all original accessories**. I don't have the box anymore. The accessories are possibly in my box of random chargers and cords, but I don't know which ones would be from this phone. 
* They want the AKG headphones I got as a promo back. **I don't have these anymore.** I recall giving them to someone and I may have simply ended up saying to keep them for a small cost - they weren't really my favorite cans. 
* They want the wireless charging pad I **paid for in full at time of purchase** back. Again, I have a few wireless pads, I don't know which one, and in any case I certainly don't have the box anymore.

Questions I've tried to ask Samsung and have gotten absolutely no response (either nothing or a robo-response that doesn't answer the question):

* What happens if I don't send back the box, but only send the phone? The phone is in good condition and I can package it properly. Will I be charged some amount for not having the box? Will Samsung try to claim I didn't send back what was asked for and try to still charge me the whole price of the phone?
* What happens if I can't return the AKG headphones since I don't have them anymore? The invoice says the cost was ""free"" so I don't even know how Samsung could try to claim that I owe some unspecified amount. 
* What happens if I don't return the charging pad, which I paid for and have proof of this in both my initial payment invoice and my credit card statement? I can't be charged again for the same product, can I?

It really just seems I'm being funneled through the automated process. Anyone I've spoken to on the phone has simply said it needs to be ""escalated"" but nobody ever calls back. Email either sends me something like ""I understand you need to return your phone - to do that, pack it in the original box..."" or ""I will send your question to a rep who will get back to you"" which never happens. 

I do not have the $1150 available that Samsung would demand for a full payment, and one of the Emails was a strongly worded threat that nonpayment will be immediately sent to collections. 

I hesitate to even send back the phone now, because I fear Samsung might claim I didn't send it back in the right condition, and then try to both keep the phone **and** charge me (imagine if the phone was broken - mine isn't - how they'd handle that). Given how inept their automated system and CS department has been thus far, I don't have much trust left that this will turn out fairly for me.

Samsung did an amazing job with the S10. And it left too many people wanting this new device. As you can see here or on youtube or forums, a lot of people are ready to make the jump (from iPhones or other brands like the Pixels).

These people (specially iPhone users) are used to long and timely support. If Samsung wants to keep them, it might need to offer something similar. 

I mean, some 5 years old iPhones got iOs 12 and people still using them, if this person starts using a Galaxy S10 and you tell him, he won´t get any major OS update after two years (with all the delays), I don´t think he would like to stay.

awam4l,"I am really strongly debating this. I have never entered a phone contract before but with the latest samsung phones, I'm quite tempted. 

I live in Canada and work for a service provider dealer. Just with my inside knowledge, i can get myself some good deals. To state the numbers plainly, what it will cost me to open a post-paid phone account with a talktextdata plan, minus what i already pay for prepaid, plus what i will be paying for the phone upfront: 

I can get the S9+ over 2 years for $520CAD, or the S10E for $720CAD.

Currently I have just been using an S6 i bought from ebay 2.5 years ago. Still works fine but the new phones have some great features, and its nice to upgrade when you're in a vantage point, rather than when your current phone dies and you have to be in a hurry and miss out on the good deals.

awb60x,"Hey Folks, I've been a pretty avid Apple fan and user since I started using smartphones, but Apple at this point has completely priced me out of their ecosystem, and after looking at the specs of the S10 and all of it's features I couldn't help but start to question if I should make the switch.

I guess I'm here to get some answers about certain things straight from the horse's mouth so to speak. I came here because I could go read tech articles all I want, but I feel more assured if I'm able to talk to actual people and get some personal input before I make any decisions.

The main things that are keeping me from just making the switch immediately are as follows:

Friends who have purchased Samsung devices after switching from Apple have reported pretty severe slowdown after extended use, and part of the draw of Apple for me is although you can do slightly less with each of its features, you're nearly guaranteed they're all going to work and going to work well. My 7Plus still smoothly rips through any of the things I use on it. How common of a problem is this actually? How common is fairly early slowdown and how is the general smoothness of the OS, apps, and features? Security is also somewhat of a concern for me, and to my understanding Apple is one of the only companies that hasn't been involved in any shading dealing with data and seem to be pretty dedicated to protecting users. Finally, the camera. People like to clown on Android cameras and although I'm aware a lot of it is pretty severe hyperbole, most photos I've seen taken on a Samsung device, even the newer ones, just seem.... off? It's almost like they have their own slight filter that they just bake onto every photo taken. I've always been a fan of the slightly more mild and true to life photos Iphones are able to capture.

Overall I'd just like any of you fine folks that have used both to either dispel or help give me  more accurate understanding of my concerns. Thanks!",samsung,2019-03-01 23:26:59

&amp;#x200B;

Samsung is essentially the only true competitor left in the smartphone market that have retained the headphone jack on their phones. Most of the competition have removed the headphone jack from their phones, but Samsung's newly released Galaxy S10 series still keep it, and I am so grateful for that.

By now, most people are very aware of companies removing the headphone jack from their phones, and although most people are familiar as to why it's a bad idea, I'd like to reiterate on the main reasons:

* The headphone jack is still a feature that **many** people use (and it isn't necessarily entitled to headphones).
* Bluetooth audio is not as reliable as just sticking in your headphones and listening. (More on this later) Also, dongles are not fun.

But my personal problem with removing the headphone jack is slightly different. I personally own a pair of Bluetooth headphones and absolutely adore the comfort in using them for running, and I think it's awesome to see the new advancements we make in Bluetooth technology day by day. But I was bothered by the idea that phone manufacturers were taking it away to force us into this new ""wireless future,"" even when they very clearly have space to retain the headphone jack. It's lazy and it's not innovation of any sort.

Again, it's awesome that Bluetooth headphones get increasingly better, and I support the new addition of this technology. I also know that to criticize the companies who have already done away with the headphone jack is completely useless; they have moved on. But we still have one company left. **Samsung**.

So why am I writing this post then?

These days it's so normal to see a phone without a headphone jack, and the pressure from other phone companies to join this trend is growing. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if Samsung is facing some serious flack from others for not being ""progressive"" and doing the same. As the release of the Galaxy Note 10 slowly speculates, this is where we need to show gratitude to Samsung for not giving into the pressure to remove the headphone jack, but also give Samsung a helping hand to stay this way. **We like the headphone jack and please keep it.**

There's so much satisfaction in the small things a headphone jack can do that we take for granted. It's awesome that I can use an AUX cord to plug my phone into my friend's car to play music. It's awesome that I can pull out my tangled earbuds and plug them into listen to music on the subway. And I'm sure many, many others still appreciate it. 

So Samsung, thank you for keeping the headphone jack on your new flagships. Please continue to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl:dr, the headphone jack is still a great feature that people use. Bluetooth technology is great but it's still not as reliable. Samsung, you are a blessing for keeping it on your new Galaxy phones and please don't give into the pressure around you and remove it in your upcoming releases.",samsung,2019-03-02 06:49:41
awf9j7,"Ok, so a I just wanted to take a moment to shout out to Samsung and say that I actually LOVE the punch hole/pill for the cameras on this new line of phones! In almost every video and post I see on the internet someone always at one point or another has to point out that the hole/pill is an issue to them and that ""some people may not like it."" While it's true that not everyone will like this design, I feel that the large number of preorder sales alone speak louder than words that people really love this new phone and the design of the front cameras! One of the reasons I love the hole/pill is because I feel that it is much easier for it to disappear into the background while using the phone and even while watching videos and playing games more so than having a large notch take a huge bite out of your screen. Not to mention the hole is oriented in a corner as most mediums do not use those areas as often, effectively making the hole even less intrusive imo. OF COURSE I would prefer for the hole/pill to be much smaller or for the camera to be under the screen, but as it is right now, this is the best we can get and it can only get better from here.

I want to hear from you guys though, why do you love the hole/pill? How do you feel it stacks up to the notch/competition? For those of you that hate the hole/pill, do you think that the notch or bezels are superior in some way, and if so, why? Thanks and have a great night everyone!",samsung,2019-03-02 07:26:45

Whilst maintaining muscle mass it's generally a good rule of thumb to aim for 1lbs per week for weight loss. My TDEE comes in at about 2200 calories per day so to lose about 1lbs a week I'd be looking at 400 - 500 less a day so let's say about 1800 a day. Samsung is coming in saying 2437 a day + 1027 to be burnt through activity (1410 a day) to lose 1lbs a week? Quite a large difference there... Annoyingly it doesn't seem to let you pick over how long so maybe that's causing the issue...

awj9um," 

I wanted to post my experiences with [Samsung.com](https://samsung.com/) for a while, but now seems like the best time to do so. My fiance and I were able to take advantage of the Note 7 discount when the Note 8 launched. She traded in her S7 Edge, and I traded in my Moto 5G from Amazon. I took multiple videos of both phones showing that everything worked.

Things I documented with the video:

The phones were able to hold a charge, connect to Wi-Fi, the serial number, powering the phone off and on, and factory reseting the phone multiple times to show that they didn't have any additional locks on the phone. Google Account, PIN number etc.

We placed our order on two separate accounts, but both phones were being delivered to the same house. We went on vacation, and both phones arrived shortly after we returned. We sent our trade-in phones, and they were verified by Samsung within a month. No complaints. We also paid outright so we were all set with Samsung.

Fast forward to the end of September 2018. My future in-laws were contemplating getting new phones because they wanted to upgrade from their Pixel XL (Verizon). We ordered two T-Mobile Galaxy Note 8's from Samsung because they were the cheapest at the time, and T-Mobile would SIM unlock them without any issue. I messaged T-Mobile via Twitter, and they unlocked the phones without any issue. We later ported out their numbers to Cricket after the phone was unlocked. I also made similar videos prior to send out the devices.

We received the phone first on October 2nd. Samsung received our trade-in on 10/09. It took Samsung multiple weeks to verify and validate that trade-in. Samsung won't send out the second phone until they process the first trade-in.

After the phone order was complete, we received the second Galaxy Note 8 on Nov 1st. Samsung received our second trade-in on 11/16. I didn't receive an email that our trade in was accepted until January 25th.

The trade in process needs to be improved because it shouldn't take Samsung 121 days to complete two orders. Here is some advice. Make sure you read all of the terms and conditions with Samsung. Make sure that you reset your phone multiple times, and take a video of everything. I'm currently 4/4 with trade-ins to [Samsung.com](https://samsung.com/), but I will never deal with them again. I would recommend trading in your phones locally to your carrier or Best Buy to receive the yes/no for your trade-in on the spot.

I'm trading in my Note 8 later today to Best Buy, and it's in near perfect condition. I had a Zagg screen protector installed from the day I bought the phone, and it's consistently been in a case. I'm losing out on my EPP discount and addition $50 accessory credit, but that's a small price to pay to not have to deal with Samsung trade-in.

I know Samsung claims that there better with the trade-in procedure now, but I wouldn't risk it. What if you send your phone in, and have to wait for them to send it back? You'd most likely lose trade in value. Samsung makes great phones, but their customer service needs to improve.

I hope this sheds some light on the trade-in procedure with Samsung. I've heard some horror stories, but I'm glad more carriers are providing the same trade-in values. I don't really need a new phone, but I would be dumb to turn down $550 for my two year old Note 8. Good luck!",samsung,2019-03-02 16:16:47

awqnux,"Hello fellows! 

I noticed many of you are switching into the android ecosystem from apple, the very change I’m considering making for the first time since my iPhone 5. I currently have an iPhone XS Max, and it is simply lackluster to me. Like many of you, I am hung up on not being able to use iMessage with my closest friends and family, having the titles over group messages, having a joint calendar with my wife, being able to see where each other is at through shared locations—-all through native apps. I think it’ll take some getting used to, but I’ll get passed it. The hype for the phone is real...

...but in seeing the Samsung Watch Active initial hands on videos, I’m not so sure. I had the Apple Watch Series 0 and 3, and loved them both, especially the three. It worked great, had a wonderful screen, and was intuitive and great for both activity and general usage. This new Samsung watch looks OK. The bezel honestly looks huge, especially when compared to the Series 4 Apple Watch. I am genuinely surprised they went with such a big bezel, and knowing it isn’t as fully featured as the Samsung Galaxy Watch, while still being newer, is a bit disappointing as well.

Are there any of you who have already made the switch from Apple to Samsung and switched watches too? How was the experience? Did you find that you missed the watch more than the iPhone? How about those who are switching for the S10+ and are having to give up the Apple Watch in the process, how did you convince yourself of that? 

I ordered both products and will receive both on Friday, so I will obviously make my final decision then, but I definitely think if I end up returning the products and sticking to apple it’d be because of the Watch, not the phone.

&gt;**Samsung is cooperating with Instagram to add a new “Instagram mode” directly to the original camera app on the newly released Galaxy S10.**

*“We’ve worked together to rethink the experience of Instagram on the S10,”* said Instagram’s head of product, Adam Mosseri at the Galaxy Unpacked event.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/daugd944zuj21.jpg

 This new Instagram mode is formed right into Samsung’s stock camera app and is selectable precisely like you would choose the pro shooting or panorama modes. The Instagram mode allows users to capture and upload directly to their Instagram stories, complete with stickers, text, Instagram’s editing tools, hashtags and more, for what Samsung is calling it the “*best Instagram experience on a smartphone.”*

To show it off, Mosseri took a picture and uploaded it to his Instagram story right from the stage, which you can see in the picture below.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to the Instagram community, Samsung is also opening up its camera in an open SDK so that developers can take complete advantage of new camera features in their apps. So far, Snow, Snapchat, and Lime have been stated as partners, with the promise that within the new SDK, pictures you take in those apps will be just as perfect as ones you capture in the native camera app.

**Instagram** will probably take advantage of that access inside its own application, too, but it’s the only platform that will be getting on the spotlight in the camera app itself.

awti4m,"I wish I had known of the horror stories about orders placed with Samsung.com prior to originally pre-ordering an unlocked S10e.  

I indicated I would trade in my immaculate LG G6 for the allowed $300 credit, and placed my order through Samsung's financing department on February 27, at precisely 9:00am. I received an email stating it is received and being processed. At 10:09am I received a follow-up email saying it was being processed and I would be notified as soon as the order shipped.  

The next day while browsing this subreddit I started to come across stories of issues with Samsung.com's terrible practices. Shipping issues, payment issues, financing issues, and trade-in denials on flawless devices. Some of these denied devices even has video evidence of their functionality and lack of damage prior to being sent in! Many of these denials were up to 6 months after receiving the trade-in device.  


While looking into it further, I came across how terrible TD bank is, the bank that handles Samsung Financing, and also noticed that I have no provided information to log into the account via TD bank and have to wait for however long to even receive the required information to access the account. They only provide you with the last 4 digits of your account AFTER you make a purchase. Speaking of Samsung's financing, I didn't even receive the email ""welcoming"" me to Samsung Financing until Feb 28 at 3:31pm, 30 hours and 31 minutes AFTER I placed my order (which used their financing to pay...) So sometime that night I cancelled the order via the Samsung website. I expected to receive an email for my records of the cancellation almost immediately like I had when making the purchase but did not. I figured I'd get one within an hour at least.  

I receive an email at 4:56 am on March 1 stating a NEW order with an entirely different order number had been received and was being processed. The new order was an exact duplicate of the first one; same phone/color/options/LG G6 trade-in/billing and shipping information/using the same Samsung Financing account number.  4 minutes later at 5:00am another email saying they could not cancel my original order ""because it has already left our shipping facility."" At 5:15 am, yet another email saying they actually WERE able to cancel the original order, the one that just 15 minutes prior had been unable to be cancelled due to being shipped. This is making absolutely no sense by now.  

At 7:07am another email. The second, duplicate order which I did not place, is being processed and I'll receive further information once shipped. All of this has happened whilst I was asleep. 

I didn't even notice these emails until around 6pm, by now I'm kind of busy with my Friday night family stuff. I go to Samsungs ""Manage my Accounts"" page to cancel the 2nd order in the same way I had the first. There's no cancellation option. I open a chat to request a cancel, am sitting there for over 30 minutes without being connected to anyone. I get frustrated and close it out, I've got other stuff to do on Friday evening. On Saturday the wife and I have the kitchen already torn apart for a small remodel we've been working on. We get up and basically work all day painting and removing shelves and cabinets, etc. Head to bed. I wake up today early around 3 am and remember this whole order issue and try again to cancel. No cancel option. I open another chat and this time, after waiting about 10 minutes, finally speak to someone. I explain the situation and they say it's been shipped already but that I can just refuse to shipment and it'll be returned to Samsung's with no charges or fees for doing so, and the entire purchase proceed applied to the financing account with be refunded. I'm thinking great, problem solved! I thank the representative for their time and head out. A little bit later it occurs to me I haven't received a tracking number for my ""shipped"" order which is going to give me no proof of return delivery.  

I open a new chat explaining I need the tracking number so I can confirm when the package is returned to Samsung. The representative tells me it hasn't shipped yet but I'll get that information when it does. What the hell??? I told them I was denied cancellation because it had ""shipped"" and all of the previous issues I'd had such as not even placing the 2nd order. They tell me the order is confirmed ready to ship and essentially awaiting to be picked up by the shipping company. I again tell them this order wasn't even placed by me, I have no intentions of accepting it, and it will be returned automatically. I'm basically told there's nothing they can do. So the order I DID NOT place, that I wanted to cancel the day it was generated, a Friday, and not given the option because it had been ""shipped"", will have been sitting there NOT SHIPPED for over 48 hours by the time it's picked up by the courier, and I'm denied cancellation.

awu9kj,"I'm switching from an iPhone X to a Samsung Galaxy 10+ and I'm terrified.  It's just that I had a Samsung Galaxy s3 7 years ago and I had the worst experience.  The apps got super slow after a year and the phone would overheat.  This was the catalyst for me switching to iPhone 6+ and I've never had any issues.  

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend is a huge Samsung fan but when we met 2 years ago I convinced him to get an iPhone X with me for iMessage, Apple cash, Animoji, FaceTime and such.  He wasn't super excited about it but he had an ok experience with the X. The one thing he missed the most was being able to customize his phone and notifications with Samsung that he didn't get with iPhone.  This year, when Samsung released the 10+ he was super excited to switch back and of course he convinced me to give it a try as well.  My S10+ is scheduled to arrive on the 15th and his on the 8th. 

&amp;#x200B;

I currently own a MacBook Air, HomePod, AirPods, Apple Watch Series 3 and 4 and lots of Apple accessories for both the Watch and the iPhone.  I'm a huge music junkie so Apple Music is my LIFE.  I'm just really worried that switching to Samsung will ruin the music experience for me as well as going from the fluid user-friendly iOS to Android.  

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts, tips, suggestions, app recommendations would be greatly welcomed.  ",samsung,2019-03-03 14:06:41

Samsung is committed to delivering consistent battery performance over the lifecycle of the phone to provide users with an optimal experience.

This is an official statement from Samsung. This was regarding the S9(Exynos) battery drain issue. I doubt that that has changed over the period of one year. The differences youll get wont be noticable.

I use it so much now its honestly one of the reasons im glued to samsung and just preordered s10+

Seconds matter, I dont want to say ""ok bixby"" 3 times, wonder if it heard me, stare at the screen, wait for the prompt that its finally ready for me to talk....I doubt I would even use it anymore.  I never use google for that reason except when I'm clicking the microphone on the search bar, or rarely holding the home button.

I never hit the button accidentally (maybe when the phone was a week old years ago)

Bixby does everything I need and the button makes it very easy for me.  Every time I watch a YouTube video that talks about how horrible Bixby is in the hope they'll remove the button in the next phone I cringe.

Are people even trying to use it? I feel like the hate is just a meme.

The deal is that i would really like to buy the phone, but Samsung seems to belive that Romanian people have more money (that is far far away from the truth) that other citizens in this world. 

First of all the price for an s10+ is not at all $900 , it is $1100+ (in local currency 4800 RON).

Second , you do NOT get the Ear Buds guaranteed, they have a shitty campaign witch is like this : if you preorder s10 or s10+ you MAY win the Ear Buds if you sign up in Samsung Members and click the promotiom banner between 1 - 8 April and complete your details in the first 2000 people ! 2000 ! Really guys ? And that is not all, even if they say that is only a preorder ""bonus"" phones bought after the preorder ends untill 15 March can still join the campaign. So basically there is NO preorder bonus. 
Many people adressed this matter on Samsung Romania facebook page but were ignored. Maybe i can get some answers here.

Third, there is not even the Flamingo Pink color available .

Fourth, there is no buyback programe. I had an s4 mini , s5 , s6 edge , s7 edge (1 black and 1 gold) and now i have the s8+ but can't trade back for discount.

I love the phone and i would very much like to buy it, but Samsung is not motivating me in anyway.

2. No guaranteed Buds
3. No pink color
4. No buyback programe

# March 2019 security patch details confirmed by Samsung

Samsung has now confirmed the details of the March 2019 security patch. The latest security maintenance release should start making its way to compatible devices in the coming days. As expected, it brings bug fixes from both Google and Samsung.

We have seen in recent months that one or two devices actually get the new patch even before it’s detailed by Samsung. That happened last week when we reported on [firmware being available for the Galaxy M20 with the March 2019 patch](https://www.sammobile.com/2019/03/01/samsung-galaxy-m20-update-march-2019-security-patch).

## March 2019 security patch brings bug fixes

The security maintenance release for March 2019 includes patches for eight critical vulnerabilities found in the Android OS. That’s in addition to the dozens of high-risk and a single moderate-risk vulnerability patched with this release. The most severe Android OS vulnerability fixed could enable a remote attacker to use a special file to run arbitrary code in the context of a privileged process.

However, Google received no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of the reported issues which have now been patched. Also included in this release are patches for 11 Samsung Vulnerabilities and Exposures (SVE) items. Samsung’s vulnerabilities include one which leaked Private Mode thumbnail contents in Gallery and allowed exposure of Secure Folder preview in recent apps.

Samsung will now get down to the business of rolling out this security patch to compatible devices. We should expect that to happen over the next couple of weeks. Its flagship handsets will most likely be the first to receive the March 2019 security patch.

On previous android versions it (note 8) had a media mode (i don't know the exact name) that would boost screen brightness and Wi-Fi reception etc. And so it seems that the new update removed that, and now we only got the 2 power saving modes and a performance mode, who doesn't boost Wi-Fi at all. In some places at my house I don't get max Wi-Fi signal and needed the boost for 1080p60Fps videos on youtube. Is there anyway that the Wi-Fi boost mode is somewhere hidden?

axqgwn,"Ok, so I always have a tablet on the side of my monitor which has all my emails, whether widgets, alarms etc. I basically use it as a side computer.

&amp;#x200B;

I also always have it at a distance which is why I always have a mouse and keyboard connected to it. The keyboard is always on the somewhere as i almost never use it. I basically use it mostly to get notifications and know exactly where they are from etc. - so the mouse is the thing I always use to interact with it which is sitting on my desk next to my computer mouse.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, prior to the tab s4, I had a tab s2. The mouse on it performed perfectly. What I mean by perfect is that even though it didn't exactly feel like a PC, like for example using the scroll wheel to scroll wouldn't actually scroll in some apps. When I brought my pointer to an item, it didn't highlight it or anything BUT i was able to perform EVERY SINGLE action I could do with my finger using the mouse.

&amp;#x200B;

And here comes the Tab s4. They tried to make it feel more a like a computer in the sense that you can actually drag - highlight text , when you hold your cursor on top of something , it highlights it, shows you its full name in a pop up box, you can scroll with the scroll wheel pretty much anywhere **but oh boy oh boy is this half assed implementation I've ever seen.**

&amp;#x200B;

So, even though you can do all that, there are plenty and plenty of problems and Im going to give you a big fat list because quite simply and quite frankly with the Tab S4, I am NOT able to perform every single action I can do on the touchscreen with JUST a mouse and no keyboard:

* First of all, my launcher - Nova launcher. I use it because I would like to resize my widgets, icons and whatever I want, however I want - something that Samsung experience doesn't let me do as the way that works is it only lets you resize widgets ONLY if it will be usable and readable in BOTH portrait and landscape mode, which basically means setting a minimum length and width for all widgets which is far too big for me. After all I am trying to fit 5 gmail widgets, whether alarm, volume control and a bunch of icons all on the same screen - readable from a distance.
   * Anyway though. The problem with having a launcher on this tablet (and yes I tried other ones - same problem) is that you CAN NOT move any icons. Basically, all the actions that involve holding down items on your desktop and moving / resizing them are IMPOSSIBLE to do with a third party launcher using a mouse
   * The other problem with using Nova launcher is that whole highlight thing. Simply, it is bugged. It highlights one folder on my desktop and it stays highlighted even when I'm highlighting something else
* Second of all , and this happens across ALL apps (except Samsung Internet I believe) is whenever I want to COPY text. Basically, when I highlight it, that menu that usually pops up on top that gives you the option to copy if you were to do it via the touchscreen by holding the text DOES NOT show up on the tab s4. And no, it's not my keyboard that's doing that, this thing does not show up regardless of whether I have the keyboard connected or not and it did show up on my tab s2. 
   * Basically what this means is that you are unable to fully control your tab s4 with your just your mouse, you need a keyboard to be able to copy text via Ctrl + C and if you want to move and resize objects on your screen with a third party launcher, you need to use your touchscreen. **What kind of stupidity is this ?**

&amp;#x200B;

This is not that big of a deal to me since I rarely perform these actions but there isn't a single excuse as to why I was able to do all of that on my 3 year old tab s2 and this brand new tablet can't do it. I don't care what anyone has to say, I should be able to **FULLY** control my device with **JUST** a mouse as a mouse can easily mimic every single action you can do with your finger.

axubq2,"Background : I haven't touched a Samsung device since the Samsung Blackjack 13 years ago. I was on the Huawei P20 Pro before moving to the S10+. Finally, the following are my opinions and experience... YMMV.

&amp;#x200B;

Device : Exynos S10 + 128GB Prism White, bought from local telco Singtel

&amp;#x200B;

Settings : Dark Mode, WQHD+, Reduced Animations, Reduced Animation Time to 0.5x in Developer Settings. 

&amp;#x200B;

Design : Glass sandwich with a almost all screen front. For me, the thing that makes this stand out is the curved display. I know there is some hate for it but this is my first smartphone with a curved display and I love it. Makes the P20 Pro, which is less than a year old, seem ancient. 

&amp;#x200B;

Screen : I read what DisplayMate said about the screen and I concur. Best display I've seen on a smartphone hands down. One of the first settings I change was from the default FHD+ to WQHD+. The display just seems seamless, with the curved display giving the illusion of the screen melting off into the sides. However, the WQHD+ might have affected battery life. More on that later.

&amp;#x200B;

Fingerprint Scanner (FSP) : The FSP has been a hit or a miss so far but I am getting better at it everytime I unlock my phone. A lot of people have said you dont have to use pressure and you just have to tap. It's more like a prolonged tap and as a YouTuber has shown, tapping and leaving your thumb there takes the exact same time to unlock. It just seems faster for you since your thumb doesn't stay on the screen for long but the time taken to go to your homescreen is the same. The update seems to have helped the FSP too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Software : One of the reasons I didn't use Samsung phones for so long was TouchWiz. I hated what they did to Android. But damn, OneUI is amazing. So amazing that I haven't even changed the default launcher to Nova... yet. Of course the default launcher doesn't have the customizability or the gestures of Nova. It's a simplified version but it's fast and smooth. Gets the job done. OneUI has been smooth in the limited time I have used it, no lags or slowdowns noticed. I have also remapped the Bixby button to Assistant using XDA's excellent tool. Also using AdHell 3 as I cannot stand ads. I am glad you don't need to be rooted to block ads on S10. I know there are non-root tools like Blockada that exist but I just prefer an on-device solution.

&amp;#x200B;

Camera : Haven't used them much but in the very limited test shots I did, all the cameras produced better than expected pictures. I was expecting average looking pictures, especially since I am coming from the excellent cameras in the P20 Pro. But the S10+ stood its ground. None of the overexposed looking pictures from previous Samsungs. They look... natural. Of course, more samples need to be taken but as first impressions, I am impressed. One thing to note is that the physical aperture mechanism of the main lens seem to be audible. I don't know if that's the case with the S9 as well but its very noticeable on the S10+.

&amp;#x200B;

Battery : Frankly, the only thing I have been disappointed about the S10+. Bear in mind its only been 24 hours. The device hasn't had the time to learn my habits and use AI to regulate battery yet. But the battery on my S10+ seems to be ticking down really fast, even in normal usage. I am hoping it gets better in a week. Lets see.

&amp;#x200B;

Others : Haven't tried PowerShare yet so I can't comment. I don't plan on using the Galaxy Buds I got with my purchase as well. One thing that really impressed me was the sound from the speakers. They are loud and with Atmos enabled, they just sound a lot better to my ears. Buttons are all nice and clicky but the power button is positioned really high for some reason. If you have small hands (even for some people with big hands), this might be an issue. But with double tap to wake you might not need to use the Power button as much. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, that's all I have folks for now. If you are contemplating getting the S10, go get it. You will not regret it.

I have seen many people talking about Galaxy S10's etc... What about the Galaxy Buds?

However something I liked with other buds that I can't make work: connecting my laptop and phone at the same time.

So that if I get a phone call, I can answer on my phone and if I get a Skype call, I can answer on my laptop in a seamless way. (Jabra's do that).

If I'm not mistaken, the Mi Mix 3 doesn't have Widevine L1, which leads to not being able to stream in HD with Netflix (I mostly use YouTube, so that's fine). And I don't see many accessories for it. But the notch-less display is a great thing.

Mainly due to the news coverage that people are getting vouchers now to cover the price of the buds &amp; the fact they probably are using all their stock for pre-orders. I also work on the day of release &amp; won't get home until a lot of stores close.

So I was considering buying them off ebay instead, &amp; I already see a handful of listings up. I'm wondering how legitimate all of these are, I'm looking at the seller's ratings &amp; some seem reputable. But others I can tell they blantantly used youtbe thumbnails as their pictures (I recognized the thumbnail from Flossy Carter's review of them on some listings lol)

I love my Samsung Galaxy! I went without having a cell phone (by choice) for nearly 10 years. When I decided that I needed one I did months of research before  choosing this phone. After the update I just installed I feel like my phone has been replaced with an apple product. I want nothing more than to uninstall it and pretend it never happened. 

Visually it's not appealing to me but it's more than that. I don't have a Facebook nor do I need any of its apps, I miss quickly being able to switch between apps when I have many of them opened, and I really don't like new notification settings. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I understand that these are all just personal preferences and if you love it, more power to you.

I've tried searching online but I've been unable to find an answer. Is there any way I can uninstall this update? If so, how? Would really appreciate any help you might be able to offer on the topic. 

Thanks in advance!",samsung,2019-03-06 23:28:11
ay5t45,"Long rant here:

Pre ordered the Galaxy watch when it came out last year, used it almost every day in all kinds of conditions and worked great up until a few weeks ago, the rotating bezel started sticking with tiny bits of friction material coming out the edge, since it was still under warranty, I sent the watch back in for repairs, and according to the ticket, the casing was replaced. I recieved it back a week ago, and used it for a little over 4 days when the watch powered off and never turned back on (it was fully charged the night before so it was not a battery issue). Watch was sent back again for repairs, and an email back was sent stating the watch was out of warranty due to water damage, with a repair cost of $600. In the period of 4 days I used it, it was never submerged or rinsed in any kind of liquid. After multiple calls and being on hold collectively for 3-4 hours, I was connected both to the repair center who was quite rude and hung up on me after I explained the issue, and level 2 support who just repeated that water damage is not covered under warranty after I admitted that it may have gotten splashed from washing my hands. All the tier 1 support seem to agree the problem was strange but there's nothing they could do.

Now it seems pretty unreasonable that a watch they claim is ATM5 and capable of being submerged to 50M can have it's warranty voided from splashes in the sink, not to mention that the repair cost is almost double of what a brand new watch costs. I can only guess that something happened to it either during the first repair, or the water seals were not installed or incorrect, but at this point it seems like I'm not going to get anywhere with having it repaired or replaced. Their products have always been reliable to me up to this point, have had the first Galaxy phone up till my current Note 9 but this experience is making me do a double take on how they back their products. Anyone else experience a problem like this or is this pretty odd?

TL;DR Sent in a Galaxy watch for minor repair, watch dies days after it was sent back claiming water damage with a $600 repair bill despite it's never really gotten wet. Samsung support refuses to provide any kind of assistance.",samsung,2019-03-06 23:47:58

ay73r1,"My last phone is the S4 and one of the features I liked about it is user-replaceable batteries. It's not that I need to replace batteries in my daily use--batteries deplete over time and I don't want that to dictate the life of my phone. All that's needed is to replace a battery when it no longer carries enough juice and the phone is essentially ""brand-new"", at least in theory.

The problem I've come across and the reality of the situation is that I wasn't able to find an official Samsung-branded battery for it that's actually new (admittedly it's 4+ years after the phone is released). On Amazon, it seems that the sellers are selling used or third-party batteries. This is perhaps hindsight 50/50--there's probably no good reason for Samsung to sell batteries by itself, let alone years after the phone is released.

It's unfortunate, because I feel the hardware can easily last twice the life of the battery itself (My S4 is 6 years old now and still going strong other than the fact that battery is pretty poor)--I would imagine a phone like an S10 I'm getting could *easily* last longer and be even more useful with massive storage, excellent screen, and good camera. **Once the battery goes to shit though, what options are there?** The trend is that batteries are no longer user-replaceable because water-resistance is prioritized. I've never had experience with having a third-party service replace a smartphone battery--are those still a thing even with newer smartphones (say like the S8 and onwards)? Would the batteries need to be provided by Samsung or is there a decent market for decent third-party batteries for these newer smartphones? Lastly, what general price range can one expect for the service and parts?   


P.S. I'm sure batteries nowadays may be able to last longer, but the technology itself is the same--batteries have a finite charge cycle and even if you don't use those cycles as often, they deplete over time even if you take it out and leave it in the closet, for example. For most people who want to get a new phone every 1-3 years, this is not a concern, but I'm looking to realistically use a phone longer than that and I don't think it's an unfair expectation given the premium price and hardware involved.",samsung,2019-03-07 01:57:45

The weight is definitely noticeable, but premium feeling. The power button location is ok and coming from the Note 9, for sure, the S10+ is a no-kidding design as well as spec bump. 

I’ve seen some videos saying the screen protector is low quality, remains to be seen. For now, it’s on the phone, looks good/perfect install because I would be good for a bubble or two. 

Time to charge to 100% and then commence setup while plugged in. I do it that way so the early battery learning is not one of near max stress downloading, installing and setting up etc. Once done, I unplug and commence the enjoy phase.

Also, does anybody anticipate a deal the day that the S10 launches that could cut the price of the note 9 or do you anticipate any deals in the future that could would encourage me to hold off from buying?

Good Lock is made up of different modules (applications) used to customize your device developed by Samsung. The lockscreen, navigation bar, status bar, quick panel and more can be completely customized and modified to your liking. But that's not all, it also includes other functions that change the way you use your device, like gestures and the MultiStar app, which provides the multi-window functionality from Samsung Experience that was deleted in OneUI because of Google Policy.

**Why the sudden fuss about it?**

With OneUI, almost all of the Good Lock modules stopped working properly. Finally Good Lock has been updated providing compatibility with OneUI as well as many new features.

**Where can I download?**

You can download Good Lock through the Galaxy Store, however it is not available in all regions. If you can't find it you'll have to download and install the APK files manually. I collected all of the Good Lock APKs and can be downloaded conveniently here:

https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1SHT58iWOrU2wItzuYl4FO6UYjjrurAI1

**I can't find the apps, where are they?**

If you decided to install the apps manually, you won't find all of them in your app drawer. The included Bad Lock application in the above link can be used to launch some of the Good Lock modules, however it was designed to work with the old Good Lock, so it may crash when trying to open some apps and does not contain the full list of modules. 

To open the Good Lock apps not listed in Bad Lock (MultiStar, NavStar, Nice Catch, etc.) you'll need an activity launcher or an app which can create an activity widget. An easy way to do this would be to download Nova Launcher. Find it on Google Play, you do not need the paid version and you don't have to use it after installing. On your home screen, go to widgets then find and drag and drop the 'Activities' widget. From there, select a Good Lock app and choose the main activity (usually the first one). Then you'll be able to use the app like any other.

**Notes:**

- To use Good Lock you'll need to have a Samsung device running Android 8.0 or higher. There are a few modules that require Android 8.1 or higher and others Android 9. You can try previous versions of the apps from Good Lock 2018 to see if those work instead.
- Sound Assistant is yet to be updated by Samsung.
- A new Good Lock module, called 'NotiStar', is planned to be released at the end of the month.
- The modules are usually updated monthly. You can download the apps manually from apkmirror.com once they are available. I will also try to keep the provided link updated as possible.
- As of writing this post, the new Good Lock is not yet compatible with the Galaxy S10 series.",samsung,2019-03-07 17:59:29

They assured me that I had accepted everything on their end correctly. I was approved for financing, i accepted the terms, etc. AT&amp;T told me on 3/3 they did advise me that Samsung tried to do a trade in for an iphone. I have a samsung s7 currently. I called Samsung and also did a chat with them. They continued to tell me that it was my carrier. I advised them that my carrier told me that it was not their issue. 

While speaking with someone via chat on 3/5, i received a call from a ""supervisor"" telling me that my purchase was involved in an internal glitch and they offered me a $25 promo code for my issue. They said i could repurchase the phone in 12 hours. I tried again 12 hours later, and I still can't repurchase the phone because my carrier thinks i've upgraded to the S10. I've called every day several times a day and continue to get told to wait.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/anpaym/anyone\_had\_an\_issue\_purchasing\_a\_samsung\_phone/](https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/anpaym/anyone_had_an_issue_purchasing_a_samsung_phone/)

TL;dr: Ordered a Note 9 last August for launch day delivery from Samsung directly. Chose Verizon carrier financing. Received phone, activated, been using it for last 6 months. A couple weeks ago, Samsung notified that Verizon apparently denied financing and thus I have to either pay the entire cost in a lump sum or return the phone. Checked with Verizon, they have no record of the attempt to finance. Samsung partially admits it's their fault (""we are upgrading our systems to prevent this issue"") but is providing me absolutely no consideration or help.

Have talked with multiple Samsung reps both by phone and via Email and each time I get ""Someone will get back to you"" but nobody does.

Samsung claims:

* They need the Note 9 back, **in original box with all original accessories**. I don't have the box anymore. The accessories are possibly in my box of random chargers and cords, but I don't know which ones would be from this phone. 
* They want the AKG headphones I got as a promo back. **I don't have these anymore.** I recall giving them to someone and I may have simply ended up saying to keep them for a small cost - they weren't really my favorite cans. 
* They want the wireless charging pad I **paid for in full at time of purchase** back. Again, I have a few wireless pads, I don't know which one, and in any case I certainly don't have the box anymore.

Questions I've tried to ask Samsung and have gotten absolutely no response (either nothing or a robo-response that doesn't answer the question):

* What happens if I don't send back the box, but only send the phone? The phone is in good condition and I can package it properly. Will I be charged some amount for not having the box? Will Samsung try to claim I didn't send back what was asked for and try to still charge me the whole price of the phone?
* What happens if I can't return the AKG headphones since I don't have them anymore? The invoice says the cost was ""free"" so I don't even know how Samsung could try to claim that I owe some unspecified amount. 
* What happens if I don't return the charging pad, which I paid for and have proof of this in both my initial payment invoice and my credit card statement? I can't be charged again for the same product, can I?

It really just seems I'm being funneled through the automated process. Anyone I've spoken to on the phone has simply said it needs to be ""escalated"" but nobody ever calls back. Email either sends me something like ""I understand you need to return your phone - to do that, pack it in the original box..."" or ""I will send your question to a rep who will get back to you"" which never happens. 

I do not have the $1150 available that Samsung would demand for a full payment, and one of the Emails was a strongly worded threat that nonpayment will be immediately sent to collections. 

I hesitate to even send back the phone now, because I fear Samsung might claim I didn't send it back in the right condition, and then try to both keep the phone **and** charge me (imagine if the phone was broken - mine isn't - how they'd handle that). Given how inept their automated system and CS department has been thus far, I don't have much trust left that this will turn out fairly for me.

It's shady that you can't delete or uninstall Galaxy apps. I believe Samsung is intentionally making shit apps/updates to drain your phone so you get the next Galaxy.... It happens every two years when the new phones come out your phone starts draining or lagging

Please spread the word. I'm so pissed right now that I really want to screw them bad...I want to get a class action lawsuit over consumer rights violation going.

Samsung did an amazing job with the S10. And it left too many people wanting this new device. As you can see here or on youtube or forums, a lot of people are ready to make the jump (from iPhones or other brands like the Pixels).

These people (specially iPhone users) are used to long and timely support. If Samsung wants to keep them, it might need to offer something similar. 

I mean, some 5 years old iPhones got iOs 12 and people still using them, if this person starts using a Galaxy S10 and you tell him, he won´t get any major OS update after two years (with all the delays), I don´t think he would like to stay.

I guess I'm here to get some answers about certain things straight from the horse's mouth so to speak. I came here because I could go read tech articles all I want, but I feel more assured if I'm able to talk to actual people and get some personal input before I make any decisions.

The main things that are keeping me from just making the switch immediately are as follows:

Friends who have purchased Samsung devices after switching from Apple have reported pretty severe slowdown after extended use, and part of the draw of Apple for me is although you can do slightly less with each of its features, you're nearly guaranteed they're all going to work and going to work well. My 7Plus still smoothly rips through any of the things I use on it. How common of a problem is this actually? How common is fairly early slowdown and how is the general smoothness of the OS, apps, and features? Security is also somewhat of a concern for me, and to my understanding Apple is one of the only companies that hasn't been involved in any shading dealing with data and seem to be pretty dedicated to protecting users. Finally, the camera. People like to clown on Android cameras and although I'm aware a lot of it is pretty severe hyperbole, most photos I've seen taken on a Samsung device, even the newer ones, just seem.... off? It's almost like they have their own slight filter that they just bake onto every photo taken. I've always been a fan of the slightly more mild and true to life photos Iphones are able to capture.

Overall I'd just like any of you fine folks that have used both to either dispel or help give me  more accurate understanding of my concerns. Thanks!",samsung,2019-03-01 23:26:59

&amp;#x200B;

Samsung is essentially the only true competitor left in the smartphone market that have retained the headphone jack on their phones. Most of the competition have removed the headphone jack from their phones, but Samsung's newly released Galaxy S10 series still keep it, and I am so grateful for that.

By now, most people are very aware of companies removing the headphone jack from their phones, and although most people are familiar as to why it's a bad idea, I'd like to reiterate on the main reasons:

* The headphone jack is still a feature that **many** people use (and it isn't necessarily entitled to headphones).
* Bluetooth audio is not as reliable as just sticking in your headphones and listening. (More on this later) Also, dongles are not fun.

But my personal problem with removing the headphone jack is slightly different. I personally own a pair of Bluetooth headphones and absolutely adore the comfort in using them for running, and I think it's awesome to see the new advancements we make in Bluetooth technology day by day. But I was bothered by the idea that phone manufacturers were taking it away to force us into this new ""wireless future,"" even when they very clearly have space to retain the headphone jack. It's lazy and it's not innovation of any sort.

Again, it's awesome that Bluetooth headphones get increasingly better, and I support the new addition of this technology. I also know that to criticize the companies who have already done away with the headphone jack is completely useless; they have moved on. But we still have one company left. **Samsung**.

So why am I writing this post then?

These days it's so normal to see a phone without a headphone jack, and the pressure from other phone companies to join this trend is growing. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if Samsung is facing some serious flack from others for not being ""progressive"" and doing the same. As the release of the Galaxy Note 10 slowly speculates, this is where we need to show gratitude to Samsung for not giving into the pressure to remove the headphone jack, but also give Samsung a helping hand to stay this way. **We like the headphone jack and please keep it.**

There's so much satisfaction in the small things a headphone jack can do that we take for granted. It's awesome that I can use an AUX cord to plug my phone into my friend's car to play music. It's awesome that I can pull out my tangled earbuds and plug them into listen to music on the subway. And I'm sure many, many others still appreciate it. 

So Samsung, thank you for keeping the headphone jack on your new flagships. Please continue to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl:dr, the headphone jack is still a great feature that people use. Bluetooth technology is great but it's still not as reliable. Samsung, you are a blessing for keeping it on your new Galaxy phones and please don't give into the pressure around you and remove it in your upcoming releases.",samsung,2019-03-02 06:49:41
awf9j7,"Ok, so a I just wanted to take a moment to shout out to Samsung and say that I actually LOVE the punch hole/pill for the cameras on this new line of phones! In almost every video and post I see on the internet someone always at one point or another has to point out that the hole/pill is an issue to them and that ""some people may not like it."" While it's true that not everyone will like this design, I feel that the large number of preorder sales alone speak louder than words that people really love this new phone and the design of the front cameras! One of the reasons I love the hole/pill is because I feel that it is much easier for it to disappear into the background while using the phone and even while watching videos and playing games more so than having a large notch take a huge bite out of your screen. Not to mention the hole is oriented in a corner as most mediums do not use those areas as often, effectively making the hole even less intrusive imo. OF COURSE I would prefer for the hole/pill to be much smaller or for the camera to be under the screen, but as it is right now, this is the best we can get and it can only get better from here.

I want to hear from you guys though, why do you love the hole/pill? How do you feel it stacks up to the notch/competition?

I've recently bought a Galaxy Watch so looked to start using more of the health features but the daily calories don't seem to stack up at first glance.... 

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst maintaining muscle mass it's generally a good rule of thumb to aim for 1lbs per week for weight loss. My TDEE comes in at about 2200 calories per day so to lose about 1lbs a week I'd be looking at 400 - 500 less a day so let's say about 1800 a day. Samsung is coming in saying 2437 a day + 1027 to be burnt through activity (1410 a day) to lose 1lbs a week? Quite a large difference there... Annoyingly it doesn't seem to let you pick over how long so maybe that's causing the issue...

I wanted to post my experiences with [Samsung.com](https://samsung.com/) for a while, but now seems like the best time to do so. My fiance and I were able to take advantage of the Note 7 discount when the Note 8 launched. She traded in her S7 Edge, and I traded in my Moto 5G from Amazon. I took multiple videos of both phones showing that everything worked.

Things I documented with the video:

The phones were able to hold a charge, connect to Wi-Fi, the serial number, powering the phone off and on, and factory reseting the phone multiple times to show that they didn't have any additional locks on the phone. Google Account, PIN number etc.

We placed our order on two separate accounts, but both phones were being delivered to the same house. We went on vacation, and both phones arrived shortly after we returned. We sent our trade-in phones, and they were verified by Samsung within a month. No complaints. We also paid outright so we were all set with Samsung.

Fast forward to the end of September 2018. My future in-laws were contemplating getting new phones because they wanted to upgrade from their Pixel XL (Verizon). We ordered two T-Mobile Galaxy Note 8's from Samsung because they were the cheapest at the time, and T-Mobile would SIM unlock them without any issue. I messaged T-Mobile via Twitter, and they unlocked the phones without any issue. We later ported out their numbers to Cricket after the phone was unlocked. I also made similar videos prior to send out the devices.

We received the phone first on October 2nd. Samsung received our trade-in on 10/09. It took Samsung multiple weeks to verify and validate that trade-in. Samsung won't send out the second phone until they process the first trade-in.

After the phone order was complete, we received the second Galaxy Note 8 on Nov 1st. Samsung received our second trade-in on 11/16. I didn't receive an email that our trade in was accepted until January 25th.

The trade in process needs to be improved because it shouldn't take Samsung 121 days to complete two orders. Here is some advice. Make sure you read all of the terms and conditions with Samsung. Make sure that you reset your phone multiple times, and take a video of everything. I'm currently 4/4 with trade-ins to [Samsung.com](https://samsung.com/), but I will never deal with them again. I would recommend trading in your phones locally to your carrier or Best Buy to receive the yes/no for your trade-in on the spot.

I'm trading in my Note 8 later today to Best Buy, and it's in near perfect condition. I had a Zagg screen protector installed from the day I bought the phone, and it's consistently been in a case. I'm losing out on my EPP discount and addition $50 accessory credit, but that's a small price to pay to not have to deal with Samsung trade-in.

I know Samsung claims that there better with the trade-in procedure now, but I wouldn't risk it. What if you send your phone in, and have to wait for them to send it back? You'd most likely lose trade in value. Samsung makes great phones, but their customer service needs to improve.

I hope this sheds some light on the trade-in procedure with Samsung. I've heard some horror stories, but I'm glad more carriers are providing the same trade-in values. I don't really need a new phone, but I would be dumb to turn down $550 for my two year old Note 8. Good luck!",samsung,2019-03-02 16:16:47

awqnux,"Hello fellows! 

I noticed many of you are switching into the android ecosystem from apple, the very change I’m considering making for the first time since my iPhone 5. I currently have an iPhone XS Max, and it is simply lackluster to me. Like many of you, I am hung up on not being able to use iMessage with my closest friends and family, having the titles over group messages, having a joint calendar with my wife, being able to see where each other is at through shared locations—-all through native apps. I think it’ll take some getting used to, but I’ll get passed it. The hype for the phone is real...

...but in seeing the Samsung Watch Active initial hands on videos, I’m not so sure. I had the Apple Watch Series 0 and 3, and loved them both, especially the three. It worked great, had a wonderful screen, and was intuitive and great for both activity and general usage. This new Samsung watch looks OK. The bezel honestly looks huge, especially when compared to the Series 4 Apple Watch. I am genuinely surprised they went with such a big bezel, and knowing it isn’t as fully featured as the Samsung Galaxy Watch, while still being newer, is a bit disappointing as well.

Are there any of you who have already made the switch from Apple to Samsung and switched watches too? How was the experience? Did you find that you missed the watch more than the iPhone? How about those who are switching for the S10+ and are having to give up the Apple Watch in the process, how did you convince yourself of that? 

I ordered both products and will receive both on Friday, so I will obviously make my final decision then, but I definitely think if I end up returning the products and sticking to apple it’d be because of the Watch, not the phone.

&gt;**Samsung is cooperating with Instagram to add a new “Instagram mode” directly to the original camera app on the newly released Galaxy S10.**

*“We’ve worked together to rethink the experience of Instagram on the S10,”* said Instagram’s head of product, Adam Mosseri at the Galaxy Unpacked event.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/daugd944zuj21.jpg

 This new Instagram mode is formed right into Samsung’s stock camera app and is selectable precisely like you would choose the pro shooting or panorama modes. The Instagram mode allows users to capture and upload directly to their Instagram stories, complete with stickers, text, Instagram’s editing tools, hashtags and more, for what Samsung is calling it the “*best Instagram experience on a smartphone.”*

To show it off, Mosseri took a picture and uploaded it to his Instagram story right from the stage, which you can see in the picture below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/41kqyym5zuj21.jpg

In addition to the Instagram community, Samsung is also opening up its camera in an open SDK so that developers can take complete advantage of new camera features in their apps. So far, Snow, Snapchat, and Lime have been stated as partners, with the promise that within the new SDK, pictures you take in those apps will be just as perfect as ones you capture in the native camera app.

**Instagram** will probably take advantage of that access inside its own application, too, but it’s the only platform that will be getting on the spotlight in the camera app itself.

awti4m,"I wish I had known of the horror stories about orders placed with Samsung.com prior to originally pre-ordering an unlocked S10e.  

I indicated I would trade in my immaculate LG G6 for the allowed $300 credit, and placed my order through Samsung's financing department on February 27, at precisely 9:00am. I received an email stating it is received and being processed. At 10:09am I received a follow-up email saying it was being processed and I would be notified as soon as the order shipped.  

The next day while browsing this subreddit I started to come across stories of issues with Samsung.com's terrible practices. Shipping issues, payment issues, financing issues, and trade-in denials on flawless devices. Some of these denied devices even has video evidence of their functionality and lack of damage prior to being sent in! Many of these denials were up to 6 months after receiving the trade-in device.  


While looking into it further, I came across how terrible TD bank is, the bank that handles Samsung Financing, and also noticed that I have no provided information to log into the account via TD bank and have to wait for however long to even receive the required information to access the account. They only provide you with the last 4 digits of your account AFTER you make a purchase. Speaking of Samsung's financing, I didn't even receive the email ""welcoming"" me to Samsung Financing until Feb 28 at 3:31pm, 30 hours and 31 minutes AFTER I placed my order (which used their financing to pay...) So sometime that night I cancelled the order via the Samsung website. I expected to receive an email for my records of the cancellation almost immediately like I had when making the purchase but did not. I figured I'd get one within an hour at least.  

I receive an email at 4:56 am on March 1 stating a NEW order with an entirely different order number had been received and was being processed. The new order was an exact duplicate of the first one; same phone/color/options/LG G6 trade-in/billing and shipping information/using the same Samsung Financing account number.  4 minutes later at 5:00am another email saying they could not cancel my original order ""because it has already left our shipping facility."" At 5:15 am, yet another email saying they actually WERE able to cancel the original order, the one that just 15 minutes prior had been unable to be cancelled due to being shipped. This is making absolutely no sense by now.  

At 7:07am another email. The second, duplicate order which I did not place, is being processed and I'll receive further information once shipped. All of this has happened whilst I was asleep. 

I didn't even notice these emails until around 6pm, by now I'm kind of busy with my Friday night family stuff. I go to Samsungs ""Manage my Accounts"" page to cancel the 2nd order in the same way I had the first. There's no cancellation option. I open a chat to request a cancel, am sitting there for over 30 minutes without being connected to anyone. I get frustrated and close it out, I've got other stuff to do on Friday evening. On Saturday the wife and I have the kitchen already torn apart for a small remodel we've been working on. We get up and basically work all day painting and removing shelves and cabinets, etc. Head to bed. I wake up today early around 3 am and remember this whole order issue and try again to cancel. No cancel option. I open another chat and this time, after waiting about 10 minutes, finally speak to someone. I explain the situation and they say it's been shipped already but that I can just refuse to shipment and it'll be returned to Samsung's with no charges or fees for doing so, and the entire purchase proceed applied to the financing account with be refunded. I'm thinking great, problem solved! I thank the representative for their time and head out. A little bit later it occurs to me I haven't received a tracking number for my ""shipped"" order which is going to give me no proof of return delivery.  

I open a new chat explaining I need the tracking number so I can confirm when the package is returned to Samsung. The representative tells me it hasn't shipped yet but I'll get that information when it does. What the hell??? I told them I was denied cancellation because it had ""shipped"" and all of the previous issues I'd had such as not even placing the 2nd order. They tell me the order is confirmed ready to ship and essentially awaiting to be picked up by the shipping company. I again tell them this order wasn't even placed by me, I have no intentions of accepting it, and it will be returned automatically. I'm basically told there's nothing they can do. So the order I DID NOT place, that I wanted to cancel the day it was generated, a Friday, and not given the option because it had been ""shipped"", will have been sitting there NOT SHIPPED for over 48 hours by the time it's picked up by the courier, and I'm denied cancellation.

The apps got super slow after a year and the phone would overheat.  This was the catalyst for me switching to iPhone 6+ and I've never had any issues.

My boyfriend is a huge Samsung fan but when we met 2 years ago I convinced him to get an iPhone X with me for iMessage, Apple cash, Animoji, FaceTime and such.  He wasn't super excited about it but he had an ok experience with the X. The one thing he missed the most was being able to customize his phone and notifications with Samsung that he didn't get with iPhone.  This year, when Samsung released the 10+ he was super excited to switch back and of course he convinced me to give it a try as well.  My S10+ is scheduled to arrive on the 15th and his on the 8th.

i finally got my Gear S3 Frontier after 4 months of saving money. And now, i got really upset... im still trying to get it started. It wont Charge and it wont start, and i really dont know why. 

Im trying it for about 6 hours now. When i put it on its charging dock, the orange LED will Show up and starts to blink. 

Google said that could be low voltage on the Dock, thats why its Orange. Its supposed to be RED when its charging. 
But i dont have RED. When i plug in my charging dock, three LEDS will appear: 

GREEN
YELLOW
ORANGE 

I dont know what to do anymore.. and by the way, i cant bring it Back to the shop, because the receipt was in my pocket which got stolen earlier that day..

Hi,

I  would like to use the DEX capability of my Samsung S8 (Pie) -  connecting it to a monitor, mouse, and keyboard. Is there any  S8/DEX-compatible USB C hub out there that can output 4k@60Hz?

\-  hub because I'd like to connect mouse and keyboard and ethernet-  4k@60Hz because I'd like to have that option for other uses - will  probably mean DisplayPort, which is fine

Cheers!

The S10 will be my first Samsung phone so I have a few questions for you guys. Since I had the iPhone 7 Plus I kind of started to dislike the large screen since I can’t comfortably text with just one hand. Do guys think it’s still worth it to pick up the S10+ for the larger battery and extra front camera? Also, for those who are getting the S10 and not the S10+, what is your reasoning?

ax6f6b,"&gt;The Galaxy S9 is a reimagined smartphone designed to provide the best experience possible. Battery discharge time is dependent upon each user's specific installed apps and settings, as well as other environmental factors. Both processors go through strict and rigorous testing considering real life usage scenarios, in order to provide the same top-of-the-line experience regardless of processor. Samsung is committed to delivering consistent battery performance over the lifecycle of the phone to provide users with an optimal experience.

This is an official statement from Samsung. This was regarding the S9(Exynos) battery drain issue. I doubt that that has changed over the period of one year. The differences youll get wont be noticable.

I never hit the button accidentally (maybe when the phone was a week old years ago)

Bixby does everything I need and the button makes it very easy for me.  Every time I watch a YouTube video that talks about how horrible Bixby is in the hope they'll remove the button in the next phone I cringe.

axecu9,"Hey guys, here i am posting again.

The deal is that i would really like to buy the phone, but Samsung seems to belive that Romanian people have more money (that is far far away from the truth) that other citizens in this world. 

First of all the price for an s10+ is not at all $900 , it is $1100+ (in local currency 4800 RON).

Second , you do NOT get the Ear Buds guaranteed, they have a shitty campaign witch is like this : if you preorder s10 or s10+ you MAY win the Ear Buds if you sign up in Samsung Members and click the promotiom banner between 1 - 8 April and complete your details in the first 2000 people ! 2000 ! Really guys ? And that is not all, even if they say that is only a preorder ""bonus"" phones bought after the preorder ends untill 15 March can still join the campaign. So basically there is NO preorder bonus. 
Many people adressed this matter on Samsung Romania facebook page but were ignored. Maybe i can get some answers here.

Third, there is not even the Flamingo Pink color available .

Fourth, there is no buyback programe. I had an s4 mini , s5 , s6 edge , s7 edge (1 black and 1 gold) and now i have the s8+ but can't trade back for discount.

I love the phone and i would very much like to buy it, but Samsung is not motivating me in anyway. 
1. Price higher that announced
2. No guaranteed Buds
3. No pink color
4. No buyback programe

All of these are Country related !! Can't we all just be equal ? It's the same goddamn product...",samsung,2019-03-05 00:02:21

# March 2019 security patch details confirmed by Samsung

Samsung has now confirmed the details of the March 2019 security patch. The latest security maintenance release should start making its way to compatible devices in the coming days. As expected, it brings bug fixes from both Google and Samsung.

We have seen in recent months that one or two devices actually get the new patch even before it’s detailed by Samsung. That happened last week when we reported on [firmware being available for the Galaxy M20 with the March 2019 patch](https://www.sammobile.com/2019/03/01/samsung-galaxy-m20-update-march-2019-security-patch).

## March 2019 security patch brings bug fixes

The security maintenance release for March 2019 includes patches for eight critical vulnerabilities found in the Android OS. That’s in addition to the dozens of high-risk and a single moderate-risk vulnerability patched with this release. The most severe Android OS vulnerability fixed could enable a remote attacker to use a special file to run arbitrary code in the context of a privileged process.

However, Google received no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of the reported issues which have now been patched. Also included in this release are patches for 11 Samsung Vulnerabilities and Exposures (SVE) items. Samsung’s vulnerabilities include one which leaked Private Mode thumbnail contents in Gallery and allowed exposure of Secure Folder preview in recent apps.

Samsung will now get down to the business of rolling out this security patch to compatible devices. We should expect that to happen over the next couple of weeks. Its flagship handsets will most likely be the first to receive the March 2019 security patch.

axqgwn,"Ok, so I always have a tablet on the side of my monitor which has all my emails, whether widgets, alarms etc. I basically use it as a side computer.

&amp;#x200B;

I also always have it at a distance which is why I always have a mouse and keyboard connected to it. The keyboard is always on the somewhere as i almost never use it. I basically use it mostly to get notifications and know exactly where they are from etc. - so the mouse is the thing I always use to interact with it which is sitting on my desk next to my computer mouse.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, prior to the tab s4, I had a tab s2. The mouse on it performed perfectly. What I mean by perfect is that even though it didn't exactly feel like a PC, like for example using the scroll wheel to scroll wouldn't actually scroll in some apps. When I brought my pointer to an item, it didn't highlight it or anything BUT i was able to perform EVERY SINGLE action I could do with my finger using the mouse.

&amp;#x200B;

And here comes the Tab s4. They tried to make it feel more a like a computer in the sense that you can actually drag - highlight text , when you hold your cursor on top of something , it highlights it, shows you its full name in a pop up box, you can scroll with the scroll wheel pretty much anywhere **but oh boy oh boy is this half assed implementation I've ever seen.**

&amp;#x200B;

So, even though you can do all that, there are plenty and plenty of problems and Im going to give you a big fat list because quite simply and quite frankly with the Tab S4, I am NOT able to perform every single action I can do on the touchscreen with JUST a mouse and no keyboard:

* First of all, my launcher - Nova launcher. I use it because I would like to resize my widgets, icons and whatever I want, however I want - something that Samsung experience doesn't let me do as the way that works is it only lets you resize widgets ONLY if it will be usable and readable in BOTH portrait and landscape mode, which basically means setting a minimum length and width for all widgets which is far too big for me. After all I am trying to fit 5 gmail widgets, whether alarm, volume control and a bunch of icons all on the same screen - readable from a distance.
   * Anyway though. The problem with having a launcher on this tablet (and yes I tried other ones - same problem) is that you CAN NOT move any icons. Basically, all the actions that involve holding down items on your desktop and moving / resizing them are IMPOSSIBLE to do with a third party launcher using a mouse
   * The other problem with using Nova launcher is that whole highlight thing. Simply, it is bugged. It highlights one folder on my desktop and it stays highlighted even when I'm highlighting something else
* Second of all , and this happens across ALL apps (except Samsung Internet I believe) is whenever I want to COPY text. Basically, when I highlight it, that menu that usually pops up on top that gives you the option to copy if you were to do it via the touchscreen by holding the text DOES NOT show up on the tab s4. And no, it's not my keyboard that's doing that, this thing does not show up regardless of whether I have the keyboard connected or not and it did show up on my tab s2. 
   * Basically what this means is that you are unable to fully control your tab s4 with your just your mouse, you need a keyboard to be able to copy text via Ctrl + C and if you want to move and resize objects on your screen with a third party launcher, you need to use your touchscreen. **What kind of stupidity is this ?**

&amp;#x200B;

This is not that big of a deal to me since I rarely perform these actions but there isn't a single excuse as to why I was able to do all of that on my 3 year old tab s2 and this brand new tablet can't do it. I don't care what anyone has to say, I should be able to **FULLY** control my device with **JUST** a mouse as a mouse can easily mimic every single action you can do with your finger.

axubq2,"Background : I haven't touched a Samsung device since the Samsung Blackjack 13 years ago. I was on the Huawei P20 Pro before moving to the S10+. Finally, the following are my opinions and experience... YMMV.

&amp;#x200B;

Device : Exynos S10 + 128GB Prism White, bought from local telco Singtel

&amp;#x200B;

Settings : Dark Mode, WQHD+, Reduced Animations, Reduced Animation Time to 0.5x in Developer Settings. 

&amp;#x200B;

Design : Glass sandwich with a almost all screen front. For me, the thing that makes this stand out is the curved display. I know there is some hate for it but this is my first smartphone with a curved display and I love it. Makes the P20 Pro, which is less than a year old, seem ancient. 

&amp;#x200B;

Screen : I read what DisplayMate said about the screen and I concur. Best display I've seen on a smartphone hands down. One of the first settings I change was from the default FHD+ to WQHD+. The display just seems seamless, with the curved display giving the illusion of the screen melting off into the sides. However, the WQHD+ might have affected battery life. More on that later.

&amp;#x200B;

Fingerprint Scanner (FSP) : The FSP has been a hit or a miss so far but I am getting better at it everytime I unlock my phone. A lot of people have said you dont have to use pressure and you just have to tap. It's more like a prolonged tap and as a YouTuber has shown, tapping and leaving your thumb there takes the exact same time to unlock. It just seems faster for you since your thumb doesn't stay on the screen for long but the time taken to go to your homescreen is the same. The update seems to have helped the FSP too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Software : One of the reasons I didn't use Samsung phones for so long was TouchWiz. I hated what they did to Android. But damn, OneUI is amazing. So amazing that I haven't even changed the default launcher to Nova... yet. Of course the default launcher doesn't have the customizability or the gestures of Nova. It's a simplified version but it's fast and smooth. Gets the job done. OneUI has been smooth in the limited time I have used it, no lags or slowdowns noticed. I have also remapped the Bixby button to Assistant using XDA's excellent tool. Also using AdHell 3 as I cannot stand ads. I am glad you don't need to be rooted to block ads on S10. I know there are non-root tools like Blockada that exist but I just prefer an on-device solution.

&amp;#x200B;

Camera : Haven't used them much but in the very limited test shots I did, all the cameras produced better than expected pictures. I was expecting average looking pictures, especially since I am coming from the excellent cameras in the P20 Pro. But the S10+ stood its ground. None of the overexposed looking pictures from previous Samsungs. They look... natural. Of course, more samples need to be taken but as first impressions, I am impressed. One thing to note is that the physical aperture mechanism of the main lens seem to be audible. I don't know if that's the case with the S9 as well but its very noticeable on the S10+.

&amp;#x200B;

Battery : Frankly, the only thing I have been disappointed about the S10+. Bear in mind its only been 24 hours. The device hasn't had the time to learn my habits and use AI to regulate battery yet. But the battery on my S10+ seems to be ticking down really fast, even in normal usage. I am hoping it gets better in a week. Lets see.

&amp;#x200B;

Others : Haven't tried PowerShare yet so I can't comment. I don't plan on using the Galaxy Buds I got with my purchase as well. One thing that really impressed me was the sound from the speakers. They are loud and with Atmos enabled, they just sound a lot better to my ears. Buttons are all nice and clicky but the power button is positioned really high for some reason. If you have small hands (even for some people with big hands), this might be an issue. But with double tap to wake you might not need to use the Power button as much. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, that's all I have folks for now. If you are contemplating getting the S10, go get it. You will not regret it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen many people talking about Galaxy S10's etc... What about the Galaxy Buds?

&amp;#x200B;

I got them, I really enjoy the sound quality when connected to the S10.

However something I liked with other buds that I can't make work: connecting my laptop and phone at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

So that if I get a phone call, I can answer on my phone and if I get a Skype call, I can answer on my laptop in a seamless way. (Jabra's do that).

&amp;#x200B;

If I'm not mistaken, the Mi Mix 3 doesn't have Widevine L1, which leads to not being able to stream in HD with Netflix (I mostly use YouTube, so that's fine). And I don't see many accessories for it. But the notch-less display is a great thing.

Pre ordered the Galaxy watch when it came out last year, used it almost every day in all kinds of conditions and worked great up until a few weeks ago, the rotating bezel started sticking with tiny bits of friction material coming out the edge, since it was still under warranty, I sent the watch back in for repairs, and according to the ticket, the casing was replaced. I recieved it back a week ago, and used it for a little over 4 days when the watch powered off and never turned back on (it was fully charged the night before so it was not a battery issue). Watch was sent back again for repairs, and an email back was sent stating the watch was out of warranty due to water damage, with a repair cost of $600. In the period of 4 days I used it, it was never submerged or rinsed in any kind of liquid. After multiple calls and being on hold collectively for 3-4 hours, I was connected both to the repair center who was quite rude and hung up on me after I explained the issue, and level 2 support who just repeated that water damage is not covered under warranty after I admitted that it may have gotten splashed from washing my hands. All the tier 1 support seem to agree the problem was strange but there's nothing they could do.

Now it seems pretty unreasonable that a watch they claim is ATM5 and capable of being submerged to 50M can have it's warranty voided from splashes in the sink, not to mention that the repair cost is almost double of what a brand new watch costs. I can only guess that something happened to it either during the first repair, or the water seals were not installed or incorrect, but at this point it seems like I'm not going to get anywhere with having it repaired or replaced. Their products have always been reliable to me up to this point, have had the first Galaxy phone up till my current Note 9 but this experience is making me do a double take on how they back their products. Anyone else experience a problem like this or is this pretty odd?

ay73r1,"My last phone is the S4 and one of the features I liked about it is user-replaceable batteries. It's not that I need to replace batteries in my daily use--batteries deplete over time and I don't want that to dictate the life of my phone. All that's needed is to replace a battery when it no longer carries enough juice and the phone is essentially ""brand-new"", at least in theory.

The problem I've come across and the reality of the situation is that I wasn't able to find an official Samsung-branded battery for it that's actually new (admittedly it's 4+ years after the phone is released). On Amazon, it seems that the sellers are selling used or third-party batteries. This is perhaps hindsight 50/50--there's probably no good reason for Samsung to sell batteries by itself, let alone years after the phone is released.

It's unfortunate, because I feel the hardware can easily last twice the life of the battery itself (My S4 is 6 years old now and still going strong other than the fact that battery is pretty poor)--I would imagine a phone like an S10 I'm getting could *easily* last longer and be even more useful with massive storage, excellent screen, and good camera. **Once the battery goes to shit though, what options are there?** The trend is that batteries are no longer user-replaceable because water-resistance is prioritized. I've never had experience with having a third-party service replace a smartphone battery--are those still a thing even with newer smartphones (say like the S8 and onwards)? Would the batteries need to be provided by Samsung or is there a decent market for decent third-party batteries for these newer smartphones? Lastly, what general price range can one expect for the service and parts?   


P.S. I'm sure batteries nowadays may be able to last longer, but the technology itself is the same--batteries have a finite charge cycle and even if you don't use those cycles as often, they deplete over time even if you take it out and leave it in the closet, for example. For most people who want to get a new phone every 1-3 years, this is not a concern, but I'm looking to realistically use a phone longer than that and I don't think it's an unfair expectation given the premium price and hardware involved.",samsung,2019-03-07 01:57:45

Did you preorder through Samsung or other retailer? Any reason for not going through your cellular carrier?
Did you preorder through your cellular carrier? What are they offering that made you choose this route?

ay7xph,"Ok, just opened my tech goodness and I’ve got to say, not since the Note 7 has a phone felt this good in-hand. The ceramic white is exquisite and the gold band separating the front and back exudes quality throughout. 

The weight is definitely noticeable, but premium feeling. The power button location is ok and coming from the Note 9, for sure, the S10+ is a no-kidding design as well as spec bump. 

I’ve seen some videos saying the screen protector is low quality, remains to be seen. For now, it’s on the phone, looks good/perfect install because I would be good for a bubble or two. 

Time to charge to 100% and then commence setup while plugged in. I do it that way so the early battery learning is not one of near max stress downloading, installing and setting up etc. Once done, I unplug and commence the enjoy phase. 

Again, I have to say how good this variant feels in-hand.

Is getting the 8GB version worth the extra money or should I save the money and get the 6GB. I know this can help the performance, but I’m wondering by how much? With the current deals now I would manage to get the 6GB ver. for a little less than $800 and getting the the 8GB for around $1000 and I’m wondering which is a better investment.(I plan on having this phone for a while and also I have the tendency to use up storage.)

Also, does anybody anticipate a deal the day that the S10 launches that could cut the price of the note 9 or do you anticipate any deals in the future that could would encourage me to hold off from buying?

I’m sorry if I sound like a noob, but I’m just curious with what everyone else here thinks. Thank you!

A great screen, as expected.  Colors aren't as vivid as the pixel, even in saturated mode.  Very natural looking. 


Best feature, the wide angle camera.  It's really wide!  Love it. 

Worst feature, the fingerprint sensor. Slow and finicky compared to the pixel.  On the back is better. 

Overall, it's ok. As usual, Samsung makes wonderful hardware, but their software is still annoying. Pixel navigation is better.  Samsung messenger doesn't do RCS.  Bixby still sucks.   Launcher is weak.  


The Buds:  They are pretty good.  Sound quality is close to the JBL Elite 65t Active. Nod to the 65s.  Sennheiser Momentum crush both in sound quality, as they should for the price. The Buds size is fantastic. Case much more comfortable in pocket.   Comfort is high in the Galaxy's.   Well worth the $130.

ayfjm2,"**What is Good Lock?**

Good Lock is made up of different modules (applications) used to customize your device developed by Samsung. The lockscreen, navigation bar, status bar, quick panel and more can be completely customized and modified to your liking. But that's not all, it also includes other functions that change the way you use your device, like gestures and the MultiStar app, which provides the multi-window functionality from Samsung Experience that was deleted in OneUI because of Google Policy.

**Why the sudden fuss about it?**

With OneUI, almost all of the Good Lock modules stopped working properly. Finally Good Lock has been updated providing compatibility with OneUI as well as many new features.

**Where can I download?**

You can download Good Lock through the Galaxy Store, however it is not available in all regions. If you can't find it you'll have to download and install the APK files manually. I collected all of the Good Lock APKs and can be downloaded conveniently here:

https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1SHT58iWOrU2wItzuYl4FO6UYjjrurAI1

**I can't find the apps, where are they?**

If you decided to install the apps manually, you won't find all of them in your app drawer. The included Bad Lock application in the above link can be used to launch some of the Good Lock modules, however it was designed to work with the old Good Lock, so it may crash when trying to open some apps and does not contain the full list of modules. 

To open the Good Lock apps not listed in Bad Lock (MultiStar, NavStar, Nice Catch, etc.) you'll need an activity launcher or an app which can create an activity widget. An easy way to do this would be to download Nova Launcher. Find it on Google Play, you do not need the paid version and you don't have to use it after installing. On your home screen, go to widgets then find and drag and drop the 'Activities' widget. From there, select a Good Lock app and choose the main activity (usually the first one). Then you'll be able to use the app like any other.

**Notes:**

- To use Good Lock you'll need to have a Samsung device running Android 8.0 or higher. There are a few modules that require Android 8.1 or higher and others Android 9. You can try previous versions of the apps from Good Lock 2018 to see if those work instead.
- Sound Assistant is yet to be updated by Samsung.
- A new Good Lock module, called 'NotiStar', is planned to be released at the end of the month.
- The modules are usually updated monthly. You can download the apps manually from apkmirror.com once they are available. I will also try to keep the provided link updated as possible.
- As of writing this post, the new Good Lock is not yet compatible with the Galaxy S10 series.",samsung,2019-03-07 17:59:29

aykvff,"How is this possible? I haven't dropped it. None of the 4 button combinations work. The lights at the bottom (home, back) illuminate and it seems the phone is working fine but the screen is unresponsive.

Do I need to replace the entire screen or is there something with the circuitry that is possibly messed?",samsung,2019-03-08 02:11:39

ayl6p2,"Hi guys, it's my first time pre-ordering from BestBuy as Samsung cancelled my order. I'm going to pick it up tomorrow. 

My question is: Has anyone's order moved from ""in-progress"" yet? It's been stuck there for a week and I'm supposed to get an email saying it's ready, but I've received no such email yet. The cancel button is still there.

I ordered a 256GB S10e in Prism Black. ",samsung,2019-03-08 02:45:22

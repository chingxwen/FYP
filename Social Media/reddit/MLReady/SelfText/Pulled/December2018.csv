a1uo60,"I just got the note 9, and I am very happy with it, except the bluetooth audio is weird. In my earbuds the volume is fine. When I use my blue tooth speaker, or in my car I need to turn the volume all the way up on both the phone and the speaker/car. And even then it's not very loud, at about normal conversation level. And I like my music loud. 

I had the S8+ and S7 edge, previous to the Note 9. And the volume was fine on everything, I never had to crank up the volume for it to be loud. There seems to be no change with earbuds. I usually listen to the earbuds at a lower volume, so maybe I am turning them up more, but I don't think so. With my wife's S7 connected to the speaker the volume goes much louder.

I've tried installing the Samsung sound assistant. It didn't make the volume go any louder, I also tried turning on developer mode and selecting the different codecs, and there was no difference.

Does anyone have any idea how to get the volume louder?",samsung,2018-11-30 17:49:02

There used to be a switch app button, a home button and a back button at the bottom.

So before I literally could hit the home button w/o looking and thats not possible.  I have to look at the phone to swipe it because your window to swipe is very narrow, half the time I end up just scrolling up in whatever app I'm in instead of opening up the home button. Using your phone while driving is always a bad idea but at least I could Hey google, call my girlfriend. But I cant even do that because I have to swipe up to get to the home button to hold it down. Scrolling the internet is frustrating because every time i go to a new page and wanna go back, I gotta do steps.   


And the worst part is I cant see any upside to this. What is gained by this? an extra 1/8th of an inch on whats already one of the biggest screens out there? I contacted Samsung to ask if theres an option to disable this/revert back to a regular home button and the answer is no (though I'm don't trust the person in tech support, they sounded very inexperienced).

About 4 days later, Samsung randomly cancelled my order citing ATT as the reason for the cancellation. They said ""Failure to Activate, contact your carrier."" So I call ATT multiple times only to be told that the reason for the cancellation was listed as a Samsung-related internal code. 

ATT tells me to call Samsung and figure out what went wrong. Samsung refuses to tell me, basically trying to send me back to ATT again. Finally I get put on hold and they come back to tell me ""This is a known problem, and all you have to do is re-order to phone at full price and call for a price match."" Super shady.

So basically, Samsung cancelled my sale price phone to trick me into re-ordering the phone at full price. On top of all that, they changed me in the ATT system to being no longer eligible for an upgraded phone until 2021, so I cant even repurchase the new phone.

To that end I pulled the little bar up and it got me started, so to u see Samsung pay I have to agree to the terms of service, standard stuff up to now and there is also an option to tick if you want to opt in (opt in not out) of the marketing stuff which it clearly states is optional.

So I don't bother ticking that I mean who wants a fuck load of spam bullshit trying to flog me shit I don't need, no one right.

I then tick the box for I accept the terms and conditions but wait what's this...... Doing that has now ticked the marketing box opting me in, you know the marketing that's optional that one the one I didn't tick... So I untick it again only for the box saying I agree to the Ts&amp;Cs to untick itself.... Odd I thought and ticked it again only for you guessed it the marketing box to tick its self again.



So far from being optional you cant accept Samsungs Ts&amp;Cs without accepting their marketing either and unless you accept the marketing you can not use Samsung pay.

So they can fuck off, it pisses me right off telling me I didn't have to opt in then trying to force me. I won't bother using it ever the fucking smelly cunts can sniff my arse crack (optional)  if they want me to use Samsung pay now. ",samsung,2018-12-03 15:35:25

&amp;#x200B;

So I've gotten a Samsung Q7FN and I'm having some issues with it that I thought maybe the community here could help me with.

&amp;#x200B;

There's two things going on. One is I'm getting rolling bars when using VRR/FreeSync with my XboxOneX. Don't matter if it's 1440p@120Hz or 2160p@60Hz. The flicker is there regardless. The video is lying a bit as eyes on the TV the bars are not that visiable. But it's clearly there.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK7cE5bPthM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK7cE5bPthM)

&amp;#x200B;

Next is a dark area on the TV. It is noticeable in dark grey images or in dark games with HDR activated. In games I can look around like you see in the video and you see this dark area. The next strange thing is that if I move my phone around the dark area follows it. And as you can see when I sit down it still is there.

&amp;#x200B;

First I thought it could be as simple as my reflection. But it cant be that as it's effectively darkening the entire panel light strength and colors in the area.

I got the case number and they sent the phone back to me with a note that said, ""We regret that we were unable to complete the repair of your Samsung product."" They sent my exact same phone right back to me.

I called ""customer service"" to see why it couldn't be repaired and after calling the repair center, they tell me that it was because my phone was rooted. I want to be very clear. I bought this phone brand new and on release day, along with my wife's Note 9. I have NEVER rooted this phone or even my last 2 phones. I checked the status of the phone and it is still currently UNROOTED. Now they sent me an ""escalation ticket"" number, where allegedly someone will call me in 24-48 hours from the ""exchange"" department.

I will also say that she also told me that the phone was ""beyond economical repair"" and told me that ""rooted"" was the same thing as ""BEM"". I cut her off and said absolutely not. They are in no way the same thing. So after a 2nd call to the repair center, I was told that my Note 9 had been jail broken.

Has anyone has a situation like this? Was my phone potentially rooted at some point prior to me knowing about it? Is Samsung just lying about the rooting status to get out of repairing the phones?

I read about things happening like this where when a phone is sent in Samsung claims they can't repair it because of ""water damage"" and the phone owner says that phone was never around water. I thought situations like this only happen on the internet. I can't believe I am in a situation where I actually had to say that the Samsung repair center is lying.

a31bqg,"They released in 2017 and were initially in terrible shape. I've been keeping my eyes on them since then however. They've gotten more firmware updates than any other monitor I've ever seen in my life. The 27"" is currently on 1020.0 I think and the 32"" is on 1019.0 I think.

I wouldn't get the 32"" version because it uses PWM (pulse width modulation) for some stupid reason which means it's not flicker-free. And flickering monitors cause me to get headaches when using them for long periods of time.

There were so many issues with these monitors at release that I don't even know where to begin to list them. There are a lot of good and in depth reviews of them. The main issue that existed in my opinion was the lack of an adjustable ""overdrive"" setting for increasing the responsiveness of the pixels. This is something called pixel response time. If pixels are slow then there is a lot of blur during movement and high refresh rates become pointless because the pixels can't keep up with the high refresh rate and there's blur.

Basically, every other gaming monitor brand has an adjustable overdrive setting. But the CHG70 didn't for some reason. When it launched, it seemed like the overdrive setting they were using was either too low/conservative or there was no overdrive being applied at all. 

Has this issue been fixed yet? I hope it has been because if this issue is fixed then it makes the CHG70 the overall best FreeSync monitor in the market. 

Note: In the Settings on the monitor OSD there was a setting called ""Pixel Response Time"" and had three options, Standard, Faster, and Fastest. Which is a very misleading thing to call it because it's actually not an ""Overdrive"" setting at all. It controls the backlight strobing. It's a black frame insertion feature. Standard is off. Faster is some strobing. And Fastest is a lot of strobing. This is not a replacement for Overdrive because this can't be used with 60Hz or FreeSync and it limits the backlight brightness level a lot. I don't think it can be used with HDR either. ",samsung,2018-12-04 14:51:36

&amp;#x200B;

2 weeks ago I ordered a Samsung S9 for Black Friday as it was £200 off. I ordered the phone, and chose 3-5 day delivery. After 6 days, I contacted support as the tracker still displayed order received instead of order processed. I was told they don't know where my order is, I contacted support again via email and was told there could be an issue with payment.

&amp;#x200B;

I followed this up with what should I do then, change the card, cancel the order? I did not receive a reply and yet again several days passed. I contacted again and was told they would ask the payment department what the issue is. A few more days pass, with no update and no information. Eventually I ask and am told that there was an issue with payment and that I should cancel the order.

&amp;#x200B;

This is frustrating to receive as by now it has been 2 weeks since the order, and each time I had to contact support and receive little information in return. At no point did Samsung reach out first to inform of any issue with payment, all I received was confirmation of order.

&amp;#x200B;

I replied, asking if they would still honor the Black Friday deal, as the payment issue is likely not due to me as the card was being used perfectly fine after. They replied saying they would \*\*not honor the original Black Friday deal\*\*, and was told that ""I suggest you can place another website and please use another card.""

My TV arrived on time and the local terminal manager could not have been more helpful in keeping me updated on the delivery. The drivers who delivered the unit were courteous and called me 30 minutes before the delivery.

I would suggest finding out the phone number for the local AGS terminal in your area, speak with the terminal manager and giving that person the shipping information that's provided. The terminal manager in the DFW terminal was more than helpful.

1. **August 20:** Order Note9.
2. **August 31:** After numerous previous efforts, successfully sign up for e-statements from Samsung Financing (run by TD Bank) 
3. **September 27:** Note9 actually ships.
4. **October 2:** Note9 delivered.
5. **November 22:** Samsung Financing emails me their 1st e-statement, oddly 3 days after it was generated (it's dated November 19.) You'd think the entire point of e-statements is they get delivered as soon as they're generated, but I digress. I pay bills on the 10th of every month and assumed it was my 1st statement, so I didn't look at it at the time.
6. **December 3:** I get a letter in the mail telling me the account is past due.
7. **December 3:** I call the 1-800 number in the account letter; agent demands payment over the phone in return for refunding the late fee. I refuse and tell them: A) I never received an October statement either in the mail or electronically and so can't be past due on something I was never informed of B) I assumed the November 22 statement was my 1st since I'd never received any from them previously C) The December 3 letter is the 1st payment request in the mail I've received from them. I ask that the issue be escalated and was told they'd call me back in 24 to 48 business hours. 
8. **December 3:** I log in to my bank account and schedule a payment matching the past due amount for December 4. Since my bank can't find Samsung Financing in their e-pay payees list, it'll be a paper check that's guaranteed to arrive by December 11. 

I did everything right, from signing up for e-statements almost 2 months before the October statement should have been emailed to me to paying right away online when I found out about the past due amount. I'm hoping to get the late fee refunded anyway, but I don't appreciate TD Bank/Samsung Financing totally dropping the ball on statements and then treating me like some delinquent.

A little backstory first: I bought the note 9 on black friday for $740 (student discount and black friday deal), apparently if you try to ship it to a university dorm address it will come up as erroneous. As a result, I not only waited almost 2 weeks to be told my item was not coming, but samsung customer service refused to do anything about it. They just told me once my package was returned to the warehouse I would get a refund and I could repurchase the phone. I asked them if I would receive the same pricing as before, and they said the only way I could do that was basically to get a rebate for the price difference. After I receive my phone I could send them my order number and shipping number and they would mail me a check for the difference.

a3pxo5,"So I bought a top loading Samsung Washer like 3 years ago when I bought my house.  It had a recall on it where you could either get bought out of your unit or get it repaired with an extended warranty.  I chose to get it repaired as that seemed easier at the time.  After the repair, either because of it or incidentally, the washer started having consistent errors with unbalancing, and probably without us knowing about it wasted a ton of water because it would try to self-repair the unbalance by refilling the load with water.  Once we noticed how pervasive of an issue this was, we requested a repair under warranty.  A technician from Dish network, which I'm assuming is just who services Samsungs in my area, came out twice, seemed to do a diligent job, but was unable to repair.  They tried to order additional parts to resolve it, but Samsung cancelled that repair, and said they were going to process a refund for us.  Since then, they have closed my ticket at least 4 times, despite me confirming that I've sent over all necessary documentation, which included cutting the cord off my washer and removing the serial number stickers and sending a bill of purchase from Home Depot.  I have literally called Samsung 10 times since then, and have yet to actually here from a refund specialist or whoever the fuck I need to talk to to just get a check cut for the refund.  I've already purchased a new Samsung washer, and felt at first like this whole thing was working out in our favor and that Samsung had treated us very fairly, and now a month later I can't figure out how any company's customer service can be this haphazard and disorganized, and feel like I'm being forced to fight tooth and nail for a refund that I was promised and that forced me to make my already poorly running washer completely inoperable by cutting the power cord.  /endrant",samsung,2018-12-06 17:13:47

a485c0,"Apparently not many people have went into checking the Game Tuner app, so I thought I might share. If you go in there, you will see under each game a ""hardware performance limiter"" option. By default, if this is turned off, the phone will use the known ""recommended"" setting, which is basically throttling the hardware when gaming. For example, for Assassin's Creed Rebellion, the recommended hardware limit is at +3, however, you can raise hardware performance for games using this up to +5.

Apparently this feature is there to limit performance in exchange for less heat production. However, for really heavy games, this also means you will not see the full potential of the phone and may lead to dropped frames or stuttering unless you lower the game graphics settings.

Another feature you can toggle here is the resolution. You like to use your phone on full QHD for videos and pictures, but annoyed at the decreased game performance? You can set games here to use lower resolution. If your base resolution is at QHD, setting it to 50-60% is 1080p, and 25%-30% is 720p for that particular game.

Alternatively, capping the FPS to something like 45 instead of 60 may also provide better smoothness if you don't want to lower the resolution. This can also be controlled here.",samsung,2018-12-08 05:49:06

a4fioq,"So a little back story.  I have always been a HTC guy even before android and iphone was a thing. I upgraded every chance I got. I had my HTC one M8 and once the M9 came out I was really disappointed.  That was around the time the S6 edge came out. After seeing the screen I really wanted it. So I went and bought it. Sadly my experience with that phone was less then pleasing. Touchwiz was frustrating to say the least and no SD card slot proved to be quite annoying.  I told myself I would never get another samsung product. Then I saw the S8. It was a sexy looking phone but I wasnt sold on it. I wanted to see what issues people were having with it. I decided I would wait and see what the s9 had to offer. By then HTC had pretty much gone down the drain(RIP). Once the s9 came out I decided to go after the coral blue s9+. After owning this phone since launch I have to say I have really changed my mind about samsung. This is an amazing phone. I dont even have the urge to upgrade like I use to cause this phone is that good. It's got every feature i could want including a headphone jack. 

My next samsung purchase was to replace my aging galaxy tab S. I ending up getting the tab S4. What a tablet! Yes it was expensive but considering my last tab lasted over 4 years I was ok will the price. I got to play with samsung flow which was pretty cool getting notifications from my phone on my tablet. Samsung experience has been superb and the battery life is outstanding. And that OLED display sent chills down my spine.

 Next thing that happened was my LG sport wear OS took a crap( it was crap to begin with) just in time for samsung to release the new samsung galaxy watch. I was unsure about it being that it had tizen but decided to give it a try mainly because of the battery life. Haven't looked back. This watch is fast, smooth and integrated very well with my s9+. Its basically everything I wish wear OS could be.

My latest purchase was the iconx 2018 edition ear buds. I was really hesitant about getting these considering all the bad reviews but I also realize most the time the only people who post reviews are for complaints. I must say that so far no issues although I've only had them for about a week. 

Basically before I knew it I became invested in the samsung ecosystem.  I still cant believe it. But at the same time I couldnt be happier. My experience with Samsung products this time around has been the best I've ever had. So to samsung I say good job keep up the work!

I bought a Note 9 over a week ago which is my first Samsung device and I'm very impressed. Especially with the display as an ex-iPad owner.

However I bought the tablet very interested by the exclusive 'Galaxy' (I think it's called) outfit skin the Fortnite video game. The requirements for the outfit ([here](https://samsungpromotions.com/galaxyskin/)) were to own either a Note 9 or Tab s4, downlod the game through the galaxy app play 3 matches (this isn't hard to do since you only need to die to complete a match). I played 5 just to be sure and after a week I've yet to recieve my exclusive outfit. 

I called Samsung who asked me contact the games developer EPIC. The developer have no support line and have not replied to my emails sent through support forms. I posted on their forums also to no avail.

Has any else using either of the devices had this issue and could offer me advice on how I may resolve this? Alternatively does anyone not play this game and could help by downloading my account and attempt the process for me?

a4o4y0,"Hello,

 My Note 8 will *no longer* connect to my car Bluetooth media audio. It connects to Bluetooth call audio, but it will not connect to media audio. My Ford is equipped with SYNC 2, and I have the Note 8 since its release. It used to connects fine for both media audio and call audio. Few days ago it stopped connecting as media audio, just calls. 

I have tried all these but **NONE** of them helped:

* I tried to unpair the other devices I have paired with my phone
* I tried delete my Note 8, and my wife S7 Edge (works fine) from my car and added it only the Note 8 again
* I deleted the most recent apps I installed (MacAfee for T-Mobile &amp; LastPass)
* I spent time with T-Mobile Tech support clearing cache, adding and deleting Bluetooth pairing, and a few other attempts but none are helping
* I also spent some time with LastPass and MacAfee Customer Services but they say their apps don't cause that
* I tried to open Bluetooth Devices and tap on SYNC and try to enable the Media Audio, but it disables immediately once its enabled with no message on the screen
* I tried to use Samsung Smart Things and tap on Set as audio output device, still nothing happens at all
* I tried to open Spotify and start playing a song to see if output source options would change, they did not, the music plays through the phone
* I also checked and both my Note 8 and SYNC 2 have the latest updates installed

Is there anything else I can try? The first thing T-Mobile Tech Support suggested is to Factory Reset my Note 8, but I want that to be my last resort. Thank you in advance for your help.",samsung,2018-12-09 19:59:35

I'm looking for an inexpensive new (Samsung) phone, I settled on two older flagship models and my main concern is the battery life. I don't mind buying the older one in S7E if the battery life is a significant improvement, as the 3500 mAh capacity would suggest... But I have found some comparisons that placed S7E's battery life lower than the S8's 3000 mAh battery, so I thought I'd ask here if people have experience with both.

Does the S7E offer a better battery life, or is the newer model more efficient despite the lower capacity?",samsung,2018-12-09 21:58:21

It usually takes many tries to successfully scan my finger (and I can only scan 3?) for unlocking the phone or apps which support it, and this is the first phone where I have to put my finger on the scanner in the exact orientation I used to scan it in order for unlock to work.

As this is my first Samsung after a brief stint with a Galaxy Nexus years ago (which didn't have a scanner) I wonder whether I have a phone with a bad sensor that could be replaced in service, or whether this phone model or the budget A series phones in general are just like that. I got that phone among other things like the gorgeous display for finger print unlock because if it works it's so convenient. But at the moment I find myself using the code to unlock more often than I would like to.

I have battery saver on ALL the time and it still goes down really quickly. From 100% charge at 8 o'clock in the morning to 4 o'clock in the evening, it ends up with 45 percent battery and it's just idling with no apps open for the duration of time. A friend suggested I use accubattery to check my battery health and it's already at 94% (however I have heard it isn't the most accurate thing in the world).

My current phone is the LG G4 and I have had it for 3 years. It held up pretty well before it sadly started to bootloop, it's why I'm looking for a replacement. Only real gripe was the lack of updates from LG both Android updates and security updates. Apart from that it was pretty good for my usage.

Had my eye on the Galaxy Note 9. I like to keep a phone for at least 3 years and hope to do the same with my next phone. So with that in mind, will the performance of the Note 9 last for at least 3 years and how long do Samsung tend to officially support their devices in terms of Android updates and security updates?

I know from my research that the Pixel line will get 3 years, OnePlus have stated 2 years. I can't find anything definitive about Samsung.

I sent the phone back to samsung and they supposedly fixed it. When I went to pick it up I decided to perform some tests on one of the phones in the store and it was the exact same thing. Then I went to another store on my way back home and tested yet another Note 9 and once again - the exact same issues. So don't come on here telling me that this is my problem.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been multiple updates and this phone still feels laggy if I start looking really close at the scroll when scrolling. Here are some of the problems:

&amp;#x200B;

* Samsung Internet on the S8 is SIGNIFICANTLY better scrolling wise (scrolling up and down with FINGER ON SCREEN)
* The horizontal scrolling in google search results (im talking about those tiles in the results such as videos) is also significantly smoother on the S8
* Google playstore's home page is also SOMETIMES smoother on the s8, many times it is equal between the two
* Twitter USED to be WAY worse on the Note 9 but it was fixed I guess
* There is also slightly more blur compared to the s8 with images and text when scrolling

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am going to say that the Note 9 boots faster and opens the majority of these apps SLIGHTLY faster, but the specs and whether or not you load something up slightly faster means NOTHING compared to how well it performs inside of the app itself. Even if one phone takes 5 extra seconds to load something but then performs significantly better once it's loaded, that phone is the winner, not the one that opened it first.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, why is this phone so terribly optimized for scrolling, why is this not getting updated ? This is supposed to be Samsung's most premium phone. I really don't get it. It is simply unacceptable to me for a brand new phone, released 1.5 years after the S8, with superior specs to be performing the same and slower in scrolling. It should be butter smooth. I don't know if they did this for a better battery life but quite frankly I CAN WIPE MY A$$ with a better battery life. Even when I used my s8 there were only a few times when I let it go below 50%. The only thing I am concerned about is 100% butter smooth performace that IS BETTER than my s8.",samsung,2018-12-16 02:12:15

​Faster animations -- Go on your Note 9 and go into the settings, enter developer options (if you don't know how to do this then click here ), next up just scroll down until you find Window animation scale, Transition animation scale and Animator duration scale. Default they are set on 1x, change them to 0.5x or even off if that suits you. After you have changed all of them, your device will feel a lot faster.✨

&amp;#x200B;

​

&amp;#x200B;

​Auto restart. Go on your Note 9 and go into settings, next go to Device Maintenance and tap the three dots in the top right corner and click on Auto restart. Turn on Auto restart and select your schedule and your phone will automatically reboot on your set time.

&amp;#x200B;

​Download YouTube Vanced, it's basically YouTube but a lot better. Videos can play in the background, no ads, supports 4k video quality if you enable it in the VANCED settings and a lot more. Download it here or here from the official Vanced website. Also download MicroG to be able to log in to your YouTube account.✨

​A good launcher. If you prefer the default TouchWiz launcher, then kudos to you. If you want something else then download one of either, Nova Launcher, Action launcher, Evie launcher, Microsoft launcher or even a Pixel launcher from XDA apps.✨

&amp;#x200B;

​

&amp;#x200B;

​Change your phone display resolution depending on what you are gonna do, personally I run the highest display setting which is 2960x1440 when watching movies, videos but when I play games I set it to the default resolution which is 2220x1080, perhaps you can go lower to 1480x720 if you have issues with frames when playing games but that should not be a problem on the Note 9.✨

a6q33t,Hey guys. I've recently purchased 65 '' Q9fn TV and the soundbar hw-n850. Apparently TV can't give an atmos signal throughout the arc hdmi port. Here comes my question. What kind of device would you recommend me to get in order to able to get Atmos signal? I've been thinking about some blu-ray player from Samsung. Also Xbox one is an option here. Although I would  want to be able to use one remote for all the devices so most probably I will choose a blu-ray. Which blu-ray model would be best for my setup?  Will I be able to use TV remote to control Blu-ray?  How the setup would look like? Do I need to connect Blu-ray through soundbar or tv? All the answers would be very much helpfully for me! I would love to finally try the Atmos at my place 😁,samsung,2018-12-16 15:59:49

Now my phone is stuck in a eternal restart, installs to 50% and it resets. Over, and over again. I took it to a Samsung Phone Repair location and they told me since the screen has a crack, that Samsung doesn't let them fix the software issue until I buy a whole new screen for it. An S7 Edge screen cost $280 to install. Plus the charge for the software fix.   


So basically they are forcing me into paying for a new screen I don't need, to fix a problem thats totally unrelated.   
I don't know, maybe I'm missing something here and they are related to eachother, but i went to another store that wasn't partnered with Samsung to at least diagnose the problem and they took 40$ from me just to tell me they can't fix the issue due to not ""having the right equipment"".   


$800 dollar price tag on the phone + 40 for the pointless diagnoses + Them literally ruining my phone and refusing to fix it = My divorce from Samsung and Androids.

We took it to the Samsung Service Kiosk in the shopping mall I'm in and they couldn't get his apps to transfer with their management software either.

Both phones were completely up to date, we tried all the obvious stuff, the new Note 9 could receive apps from other phones but the S7 Edge couldn't send any apps anywhere.

It started happening last night, where I can use the phone as long as I want, however when I press the power button or let the phone auto timeout, the always on display will be on for about 30 seconds, and then the phone shuts off and reboots. 

From what I have read, articles suggest it is a software problem, but I have uninstalled every app except for the one I need to clock into work, removed the sd and sim, cleared the cache partition, and then a factory reset. The problem still persists.

The phone has never been dropped and I always have a drop proof case on it. I work outside, but none of my coworkers have a similar problem, so it's not environmental damage.

Is there anything else I can do to try to solve the problem? If it happens to be some hardware defect, why does it only happen when the phone is idle? Worst case scenario, will Samsung replace my device, or is the warranty only applicable to repairs?",samsung,2018-12-17 15:59:16

I already have Verizon and am using a LG G4 LOL so I couldn't really say no to this. However, my order is still processing. The website says it is waiting for carrier activation. Whatever. 

So I call up their customer support because it's been 10 days and they just told me it's the holidays and it's slow and wait another 5 or so business days. Seemed a little weird to me to wait another 5 days as it seems like a problem through Verizon? So I used their customer support chat and they then told me that there indeed was a problem that is preventing it from processing. Wouldn't tell me what the problem was, just kept assuring me that I'll get a confirmation email when it ships!!

Has anyone experienced anything like this? If I have to go ahead and call verizon myself I can obviously do that. Samsung wasn't very helpful at all.

I've been eyeballing upgrading to the Note 9 early next year rather than getting the S10 (I'm kind of afraid of the S10's screen and cracks, plus no bezel at all for holding). I'm curious as to what incentives there will be price-wise for buying one vs the other. Ex will the Note 9 price be slashed? What free things will Samsung offer for pre-ordering/buying the S10 at launch?

-Ideally Spotify on watch
-on watch navigation 
-good battery life
-accurate sleep tracking
-not too big (I have small wrists)

a79ohj,"Hello everyone, first time posting here, so if there's a better place I can ask, let me know please.  


Currently I'm an iPhone user, (hand-down previous gen, never bought my smartphone on my own and when the time comes, I'm going for Samsung for sure, but that's besides the point now...)  


So, I don't have much experience in online shopping in general, but I'd love to buy the perfect gift for my niece who has this [Samsung phone](https://imgur.com/a/EelMyqb). It's [J2 Pro](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_j2_pro_(2018)-8904.php), aka  ""Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime Pro"" as far as I'm concerned, and so far everything I saw online is either shady (probably different case will be delivered) or tacky.  


For instance, [this seems like the perfect case](https://www.amazon.com/Silicone-Cartoon-Unicorn-Rainbow-Fashion/dp/B07CGRJM6C/ref=mp_s_a_1_13?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545073506&amp;sr=8-13&amp;pi=AC_SX236_SY340_FMwebp_QL65&amp;keywords=samsung%20galaxy%20j2%20prime%20case%20for%20girls&amp;fbclid=IwAR3ffAn3x8htiAbd1YuMUcRpBsXulBNNsuiN1SCWh_qTnDcB5g-J7Vq95Ro) to get for her, however, besides the fact that it has just 1 image which looks shopped, it has no reviews, and  ANYA's (the seller on amazon) other items mostly don't have reviews. One that has reviews, for instance, [this one](https://www.amazon.com/IPhone-Fashion-Classic-Cartoon-Silicone/dp/B015WFQ8IK/ref=lp_9455863011_1_10?srs=9455863011&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545125248&amp;sr=8-10#customerReviews), it says that different case was delivered and that it was late on top of it all... so I'm suspicious of ANYA's quality of business...  


Second best would be [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B07H29X4QS/ref=dp_olp_0?ie=UTF8&amp;condition=all&amp;qid=1545122892&amp;sr=8-5), but similar thing here, no item reviews, and check out [this out](https://i.imgur.com/DEpz8mm.png)... somethings off right?  


I went to ebay too, which is basically diving head first into the unknown for me (never used it in my life, I'm living outside US btw)  


[This](https://www.ebay.com/itm/3D-Cartoon-Animals-Soft-Silicone-Case-For-Huawei-Mate-10-Lite-Samsung-J2-Pro/163329272177?hash=item26072ee971:m:mLERJa0JuqGVElfUoqnVsWA:rk:4:pf:0) seems like has the choice for Samsung Galaxy J2 Pro 2018 / Grand Prime Pro.... why both as different options? Could someone please let me know what would be the most secure way of getting a cute phone case that will be fit for model I need it to be fit for?  


I also snooped around on alibaba and found [this](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/3D-Rainbow-Diamond-TPU-Case-For_60797247919.html?spm=a2700.galleryofferlist.normalList.317.1db23b0dZVbUKo&amp;fbclid=IwAR2WFZXKGHHPDf9gyR1rc0ohbJ81txMwa4Yf5NCY4awDsUGgY6g0KhtKQ_c) option, which has [what looks like the right model case for J2](https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1g2HEvHwrBKNjSZPcq6xpapXaA/3D-Rainbow-Diamond-TPU-Case-For-Samsung.jpg_350x350.jpg), but no info in written form.  


Time of delivery is secondary, but still important. I hope someone can help me who has experience in online shopping. I hope you got the idea, Unicorns are best, cuter the better, the big ones are top choice if available (bigger than phone cases)... 

&amp;#x200B;

Please put me on the right track if you can, and thank you for your time.

The problem is that after that message I can only choose to enable the wifi, and the phone remain stuck on ""turning on...(the wifi)"". Now my understanding is that samsung created a way to prevent the thieves to use the device if they stole it, but I can't verify my account if I can't pass the wifi problem, there is a way to reset my hard reset and use the phone as if it were new again?

a7gftl,"I have owned a top of the line Samsung washer and dryer set for less than 2 years and they have been the worst purchase I have ever made. To start; after purchasing we found out that our washer was impacted by the exploding top recall and had to wait 6-9 months for a decision as to what Samsung would do to resolve. They ended up offering to reinforce the top and extend the warranty by a year or replace with a different Samsung dryer (reimbursing the fair market value of the current machine which is total bullshit considering a customer had her jaw smashed open by a faulty washer). Since we did not want a mis-matched pair we opted for the fix. Before they were able to schedule an appointment our dryer stopped working. This was covered under warranty and took 2 service visits, over more than a week, to diagnose and replace the motor. After they repaired the dryer they came to fix the washer and-in truth-I haven’t had issues with it since. However, approximately 1 month after the warranty ended the dryer began squealing like a herd (pack, flock?) or pigs being molested by dirty ole farmer joe. I opted to repair myself to save some cash and had to replace all 4 drum rollers at the cost of $40 and 3 hours of my time. I have now done this procedure 3 times and every time I have to scrub the inside of the machine to removes the rust and rubber shavings that come from the bad rollers. 

Samsung has/had a reputation for quality but due to my experience I will never buy an appliance from them again. After tearing down this dryer 3 times I can tell you it is just a larger and more cheaply built clone of every dirt-cheap dryer on the market with a slick paint job and stainless steel front panel.

And the worst part is I cant see any upside to this. What is gained by this? an extra 1/8th of an inch on whats already one of the biggest screens out there? I contacted Samsung to ask if theres an option to disable this/revert back to a regular home button and the answer is no (though I'm don't trust the person in tech support, they sounded very inexperienced). Anyway, I know its a #firstworldproblem but I really hate this new ""enhancement""",samsung,2018-12-01 04:29:46

On the Verizon branded S8, you had the ""Advanced Features"" option in Settings to enable Wifi Calling.

On the Samsung.com Unlocked S9 I received, the ""Advanced Features"" was absent so after some digging around, I found the WiFi Calling option in the settings of the Phone Dialer app itself where you make calls. At the very bottom, you *should* see the option to enable WiFi Calling.

S9

Battery dying very fast, need to charge phone 2-3 times a day to last until evening

Once i unplugged charger at 100% and one hour later of just playing music i was at 37%

Internet connection drops randomly

Random lags, sometimes for seconds




Gear icon x 2018

Stutters

Sound delays multiple seconds at times

One headphone is at maybe 10% volume of the other

Sometimes connects and drains battery when in the case

a2i9vu,"So I ordered a phone on Black Friday through Samsung with ATT contract renewal agreement. I got a Samsung Galaxy S9 for $519.00 supposedly. About 4 days later, Samsung randomly cancelled my order citing ATT as the reason for the cancellation. They said ""Failure to Activate, contact your carrier."" So I call ATT multiple times only to be told that the reason for the cancellation was listed as a Samsung-related internal code. 

ATT tells me to call Samsung and figure out what went wrong. Samsung refuses to tell me, basically trying to send me back to ATT again. Finally I get put on hold and they come back to tell me ""This is a known problem, and all you have to do is re-order to phone at full price and call for a price match."" Super shady.

So basically, Samsung cancelled my sale price phone to trick me into re-ordering the phone at full price. On top of all that, they changed me in the ATT system to being no longer eligible for an upgraded phone until 2021, so I cant even repurchase the new phone.

So I don't bother ticking that I mean who wants a fuck load of spam bullshit trying to flog me shit I don't need, no one right.

So far from being optional you cant accept Samsungs Ts&amp;Cs without accepting their marketing either and unless you accept the marketing you can not use Samsung pay.

So I've gotten a Samsung Q7FN and I'm having some issues with it that I thought maybe the community here could help me with.

&amp;#x200B;

There's two things going on. One is I'm getting rolling bars when using VRR/FreeSync with my XboxOneX. Don't matter if it's 1440p@120Hz or 2160p@60Hz. The flicker is there regardless. The video is lying a bit as eyes on the TV the bars are not that visiable. But it's clearly there.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK7cE5bPthM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK7cE5bPthM)

&amp;#x200B;

Next is a dark area on the TV. It is noticeable in dark grey images or in dark games with HDR activated. In games I can look around like you see in the video and you see this dark area. The next strange thing is that if I move my phone around the dark area follows it. And as you can see when I sit down it still is there.

Items still on backorder in the email I get, again no problem. This afternoon I get the same email stating the order was cancelled. I double check everything and my shipping address looks fine and place it again. I'm hoping this time it goes through, but if I get that email again what can I do? I haven't recieved anything in the mail yet about my account. I'm confused why it keeps cancelling it. Any advice?",samsung,2018-12-04 01:00:02
a2w0y1,"You can search my recent history on this, but I sent my Verizon Note 9 off for repair for a camera buzzing/vibration issue. I got the case number and they sent the phone back to me with a note that said, ""We regret that we were unable to complete the repair of your Samsung product."" They sent my exact same phone right back to me.

I called ""customer service"" to see why it couldn't be repaired and after calling the repair center, they tell me that it was because my phone was rooted. I want to be very clear. I bought this phone brand new and on release day, along with my wife's Note 9. I have NEVER rooted this phone or even my last 2 phones. I checked the status of the phone and it is still currently UNROOTED. Now they sent me an ""escalation ticket"" number, where allegedly someone will call me in 24-48 hours from the ""exchange"" department.

I will also say that she also told me that the phone was ""beyond economical repair"" and told me that ""rooted"" was the same thing as ""BEM"". I cut her off and said absolutely not. They are in no way the same thing. So after a 2nd call to the repair center, I was told that my Note 9 had been jail broken.

Has anyone has a situation like this? Was my phone potentially rooted at some point prior to me knowing about it? Is Samsung just lying about the rooting status to get out of repairing the phones?

I read about things happening like this where when a phone is sent in Samsung claims they can't repair it because of ""water damage"" and the phone owner says that phone was never around water. I thought situations like this only happen on the internet. I can't believe I am in a situation where I actually had to say that the Samsung repair center is lying. I felt bad about doing it, but I am unbelievably frustrated. This is absolute nonsense.

I'm sorry. I just needed to vent.",samsung,2018-12-04 02:17:19

I was given a Galaxy Gear Sport as a gift but will be either returning or selling it already. It’s wildly inaccurate on runs and I’m not a watch guy so it’s not worth having just as a step counter.

I did the reset on the watch itself and it seems like it was wiped. Is there anything else I need to do to get it off of my Samsung account? The unit and serial # are still found as registered under my account in the Samsung app. Whether it’s back to the store, or a private sale, I want to make sure whoever ends up owning this next isn’t going to have access to my phone # or anything on my Samsung account.

a31bqg,"They released in 2017 and were initially in terrible shape. I've been keeping my eyes on them since then however. They've gotten more firmware updates than any other monitor I've ever seen in my life. The 27"" is currently on 1020.0 I think and the 32"" is on 1019.0 I think.

I wouldn't get the 32"" version because it uses PWM (pulse width modulation) for some stupid reason which means it's not flicker-free. And flickering monitors cause me to get headaches when using them for long periods of time.

There were so many issues with these monitors at release that I don't even know where to begin to list them. There are a lot of good and in depth reviews of them. The main issue that existed in my opinion was the lack of an adjustable ""overdrive"" setting for increasing the responsiveness of the pixels. This is something called pixel response time. If pixels are slow then there is a lot of blur during movement and high refresh rates become pointless because the pixels can't keep up with the high refresh rate and there's blur.

Basically, every other gaming monitor brand has an adjustable overdrive setting. But the CHG70 didn't for some reason. When it launched, it seemed like the overdrive setting they were using was either too low/conservative or there was no overdrive being applied at all. 

Has this issue been fixed yet? I hope it has been because if this issue is fixed then it makes the CHG70 the overall best FreeSync monitor in the market. 

Note: In the Settings on the monitor OSD there was a setting called ""Pixel Response Time"" and had three options, Standard, Faster, and Fastest. Which is a very misleading thing to call it because it's actually not an ""Overdrive"" setting at all. It controls the backlight strobing. It's a black frame insertion feature. Standard is off. Faster is some strobing. And Fastest is a lot of strobing. This is not a replacement for Overdrive because this can't be used with 60Hz or FreeSync and it limits the backlight brightness level a lot. I don't think it can be used with HDR either. ",samsung,2018-12-04 14:51:36

a32ypr,"Samsung is offering £150 deals for Christmas on several Samsung products, but if you buy these products intending to gift them, \*\*I would not recommend it.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

2 weeks ago I ordered a Samsung S9 for Black Friday as it was £200 off. I ordered the phone, and chose 3-5 day delivery. After 6 days, I contacted support as the tracker still displayed order received instead of order processed. I was told they don't know where my order is, I contacted support again via email and was told there could be an issue with payment.

&amp;#x200B;

I followed this up with what should I do then, change the card, cancel the order? I did not receive a reply and yet again several days passed. I contacted again and was told they would ask the payment department what the issue is. A few more days pass, with no update and no information. Eventually I ask and am told that there was an issue with payment and that I should cancel the order.

&amp;#x200B;

This is frustrating to receive as by now it has been 2 weeks since the order, and each time I had to contact support and receive little information in return. At no point did Samsung reach out first to inform of any issue with payment, all I received was confirmation of order.

&amp;#x200B;

I replied, asking if they would still honor the Black Friday deal, as the payment issue is likely not due to me as the card was being used perfectly fine after. They replied saying they would \*\*not honor the original Black Friday deal\*\*, and was told that ""I suggest you can place another website and please use another card.""

Well, after all the worrying and consternation I have to report I had nothing but a good experience with everyone. My TV arrived on time and the local terminal manager could not have been more helpful in keeping me updated on the delivery. The drivers who delivered the unit were courteous and called me 30 minutes before the delivery.

I would suggest finding out the phone number for the local AGS terminal in your area, speak with the terminal manager and giving that person the shipping information that's provided. The terminal manager in the DFW terminal was more than helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently bought a Samsung Gear Fit2 Pro and just did my first running session only to notice my SHealth app doesn't upload it to strava (my Strava is connected in the settings).

I've read there is a problem with the app and the Strava API or something. My question now is, is there a free alternative like SHealth? Like an app that works on it's own so I can completely delete SHealth and link my Gear Fit to that app which then uploads to Strava?

If not I'm probably returning the watch cuz this problem is 1+ year old and still not resolved and I don't want to fiddle with 5 apps to make it work. Also manual upload isn't an option because I just did but GPX files don't contain my heart rates.

a3486f,"Timeline:

1. **August 20:** Order Note9.
2. **August 31:** After numerous previous efforts, successfully sign up for e-statements from Samsung Financing (run by TD Bank) 
3. **September 27:** Note9 actually ships.
4. **October 2:** Note9 delivered.
5. **November 22:** Samsung Financing emails me their 1st e-statement, oddly 3 days after it was generated (it's dated November 19.) You'd think the entire point of e-statements is they get delivered as soon as they're generated, but I digress. I pay bills on the 10th of every month and assumed it was my 1st statement, so I didn't look at it at the time.
6. **December 3:** I get a letter in the mail telling me the account is past due.
7. **December 3:** I call the 1-800 number in the account letter; agent demands payment over the phone in return for refunding the late fee. I refuse and tell them: A) I never received an October statement either in the mail or electronically and so can't be past due on something I was never informed of B) I assumed the November 22 statement was my 1st since I'd never received any from them previously C) The December 3 letter is the 1st payment request in the mail I've received from them. I ask that the issue be escalated and was told they'd call me back in 24 to 48 business hours. 
8. **December 3:** I log in to my bank account and schedule a payment matching the past due amount for December 4. Since my bank can't find Samsung Financing in their e-pay payees list, it'll be a paper check that's guaranteed to arrive by December 11. 

I did everything right, from signing up for e-statements almost 2 months before the October statement should have been emailed to me to paying right away online when I found out about the past due amount. I'm hoping to get the late fee refunded anyway, but I don't appreciate TD Bank/Samsung Financing totally dropping the ball on statements and then treating me like some delinquent.

A little backstory first: I bought the note 9 on black friday for $740 (student discount and black friday deal), apparently if you try to ship it to a university dorm address it will come up as erroneous. As a result, I not only waited almost 2 weeks to be told my item was not coming, but samsung customer service refused to do anything about it. They just told me once my package was returned to the warehouse I would get a refund and I could repurchase the phone. I asked them if I would receive the same pricing as before, and they said the only way I could do that was basically to get a rebate for the price difference. After I receive my phone I could send them my order number and shipping number and they would mail me a check for the difference. But after what I experienced with Samsung customer service, there is NO WAY I am trusting them to do that.

It had a recall on it where you could either get bought out of your unit or get it repaired with an extended warranty.  I chose to get it repaired as that seemed easier at the time.  After the repair, either because of it or incidentally, the washer started having consistent errors with unbalancing, and probably without us knowing about it wasted a ton of water because it would try to self-repair the unbalance by refilling the load with water.  Once we noticed how pervasive of an issue this was, we requested a repair under warranty.  A technician from Dish network, which I'm assuming is just who services Samsungs in my area, came out twice, seemed to do a diligent job, but was unable to repair.  They tried to order additional parts to resolve it, but Samsung cancelled that repair, and said they were going to process a refund for us.  Since then, they have closed my ticket at least 4 times, despite me confirming that I've sent over all necessary documentation, which included cutting the cord off my washer and removing the serial number stickers and sending a bill of purchase from Home Depot.  I have literally called Samsung 10 times since then, and have yet to actually here from a refund specialist or whoever the fuck I need to talk to to just get a check cut for the refund.  I've already purchased a new Samsung washer, and felt at first like this whole thing was working out in our favor and that Samsung had treated us very fairly, and now a month later I can't figure out how any company's customer service can be this haphazard and disorganized, and feel like I'm being forced to fight tooth and nail for a refund that I was promised and that forced me to make my already poorly running washer completely inoperable by cutting the power cord.  /endrant",samsung,2018-12-06 17:13:47

a485c0,"Apparently not many people have went into checking the Game Tuner app, so I thought I might share. If you go in there, you will see under each game a ""hardware performance limiter"" option. By default, if this is turned off, the phone will use the known ""recommended"" setting, which is basically throttling the hardware when gaming. For example, for Assassin's Creed Rebellion, the recommended hardware limit is at +3, however, you can raise hardware performance for games using this up to +5.

Apparently this feature is there to limit performance in exchange for less heat production. However, for really heavy games, this also means you will not see the full potential of the phone and may lead to dropped frames or stuttering unless you lower the game graphics settings.

Another feature you can toggle here is the resolution. You like to use your phone on full QHD for videos and pictures, but annoyed at the decreased game performance? You can set games here to use lower resolution. If your base resolution is at QHD, setting it to 50-60% is 1080p, and 25%-30% is 720p for that particular game.

Alternatively, capping the FPS to something like 45 instead of 60 may also provide better smoothness if you don't want to lower the resolution. This can also be controlled here.",samsung,2018-12-08 05:49:06

a4fioq,"So a little back story.  I have always been a HTC guy even before android and iphone was a thing. I upgraded every chance I got. I had my HTC one M8 and once the M9 came out I was really disappointed.  That was around the time the S6 edge came out. After seeing the screen I really wanted it. So I went and bought it. Sadly my experience with that phone was less then pleasing. Touchwiz was frustrating to say the least and no SD card slot proved to be quite annoying.  I told myself I would never get another samsung product. Then I saw the S8. It was a sexy looking phone but I wasnt sold on it. I wanted to see what issues people were having with it. I decided I would wait and see what the s9 had to offer. By then HTC had pretty much gone down the drain(RIP). Once the s9 came out I decided to go after the coral blue s9+. After owning this phone since launch I have to say I have really changed my mind about samsung. This is an amazing phone. I dont even have the urge to upgrade like I use to cause this phone is that good. It's got every feature i could want including a headphone jack. 

My next samsung purchase was to replace my aging galaxy tab S. I ending up getting the tab S4. What a tablet! Yes it was expensive but considering my last tab lasted over 4 years I was ok will the price. I got to play with samsung flow which was pretty cool getting notifications from my phone on my tablet. Samsung experience has been superb and the battery life is outstanding. And that OLED display sent chills down my spine.

 Next thing that happened was my LG sport wear OS took a crap( it was crap to begin with) just in time for samsung to release the new samsung galaxy watch. I was unsure about it being that it had tizen but decided to give it a try mainly because of the battery life. Haven't looked back. This watch is fast, smooth and integrated very well with my s9+. Its basically everything I wish wear OS could be.

My latest purchase was the iconx 2018 edition ear buds. I was really hesitant about getting these considering all the bad reviews but I also realize most the time the only people who post reviews are for complaints. I must say that so far no issues although I've only had them for about a week. 

Basically before I knew it I became invested in the samsung ecosystem.  I still cant believe it. But at the same time I couldnt be happier. My experience with Samsung products this time around has been the best I've ever had. So to samsung I say good job keep up the work!

I lived in British Columbia, Canada and I owned a Samsung S9 plus.

They also said they will mail my phone to a third party authorized Samsung service center if I give them my phone. I just want to know is the damage really covered by warranty and will those so-called third-party service center do anything shady to my phone. I used to have iPhone and numerous other Android devices and seen many people's original phone being swapped to a second hand (even a fake one) by those third-party service center.

I bought a Note 9 over a week ago which is my first Samsung device and I'm very impressed. Especially with the display as an ex-iPad owner.

However I bought the tablet very interested by the exclusive 'Galaxy' (I think it's called) outfit skin the Fortnite video game. The requirements for the outfit ([here](https://samsungpromotions.com/galaxyskin/)) were to own either a Note 9 or Tab s4, downlod the game through the galaxy app play 3 matches (this isn't hard to do since you only need to die to complete a match). I played 5 just to be sure and after a week I've yet to recieve my exclusive outfit. 

I called Samsung who asked me contact the games developer EPIC. The developer have no support line and have not replied to my emails sent through support forms. I posted on their forums also to no avail.

Has any else using either of the devices had this issue and could offer me advice on how I may resolve this? Alternatively does anyone not play this game and could help by downloading my account and attempt the process for me?

My Ford is equipped with SYNC 2, and I have the Note 8 since its release. It used to connects fine for both media audio and call audio. Few days ago it stopped connecting as media audio, just calls.

* I tried to unpair the other devices I have paired with my phone
* I tried delete my Note 8, and my wife S7 Edge (works fine) from my car and added it only the Note 8 again
* I deleted the most recent apps I installed (MacAfee for T-Mobile &amp; LastPass)
* I spent time with T-Mobile Tech support clearing cache, adding and deleting Bluetooth pairing, and a few other attempts but none are helping
* I also spent some time with LastPass and MacAfee Customer Services but they say their apps don't cause that
* I tried to open Bluetooth Devices and tap on SYNC and try to enable the Media Audio, but it disables immediately once its enabled with no message on the screen
* I tried to use Samsung Smart Things and tap on Set as audio output device, still nothing happens at all
* I tried to open Spotify and start playing a song to see if output source options would change, they did not, the music plays through the phone
* I also checked and both my Note 8 and SYNC 2 have the latest updates installed

I’ve been between the Samsung Galaxy S9/+ (I have little hands so I’m wary of bigger screens) and the One Plus 6 - I was considering the Pixel 3 but I’ve heard Pixels just aren’t reliable. 

I’m in Canada so the networks are limited, and from the brief search I did the S9 is around $1050 before tax, and the OnePlus 6 is around $600. 

The most important features to me are battery life and reliability (when tech things stop working I get stressed lol). I also listen to a lot of music but have a Bose QC 35 II and have no issues with using a dongle (Plus most of my music is on Spotify so I won’t be missing iTunes too much).

But eventually got rid of them to come back to these old friends for my school work. (I am so broke that I can't afford iPad Pros or newer Samsung tablets).

I have a Samsung Tab 4 that us currently running Android 4.4.2. I'm running into issues with apps no being compatible with it and found out it's because I need android 5.0 and up. The problem is the tablet says it has the most updated software.

I did some research and found a forum that told me I can do it manually with Kies. I downloaded it and it turns out the tablet is unsupported by Kies but it suggested I download smart switch. I did, but there's no update prompt.

a67y1k,"Hello All,

My current phone is the LG G4 and I have had it for 3 years. It held up pretty well before it sadly started to bootloop, it's why I'm looking for a replacement. Only real gripe was the lack of updates from LG both Android updates and security updates. Apart from that it was pretty good for my usage.

Had my eye on the Galaxy Note 9. I like to keep a phone for at least 3 years and hope to do the same with my next phone. So with that in mind, will the performance of the Note 9 last for at least 3 years and how long do Samsung tend to officially support their devices in terms of Android updates and security updates?

I know from my research that the Pixel line will get 3 years, OnePlus have stated 2 years. I can't find anything definitive about Samsung.

However, Fedex told me they had to send it back due to a policy by Sasmung because I added an extra digit onto my street address by accident. To clarify, they attempted to deliver it to my house, even with the incorrect address, but had to send it back due to Samsung anyways.

No biggy, I was told by Samsung that I just need to reorder it once it arrives at the warehouse and prove to them that I bought it for the discounted price. Well I just got off a chat with support and they said they cannot honor the Black Friday price ($539 instead of $739) because discounts are time dependent.

The monitor (in the title) by itself hasn't got any speaker, so I'd connect it to my Philips HTS5540 home theater system.

It's probably a dumb question, but are the two HDMI ins also outs? Because I was meaning to use a HDMI to RCA converter to go from there to the home theater, but I'm not 100 % sure I can, and I'd like to be sure before purchasing anything.

I'm using Verizon wireless in the United States, and I'm having trouble getting my text messages and iMessages to transfer over. Every time I use Smart Switch for some unknown reason it fails at 1.7%. It states that the USB cable was removed when it wasn't, so I try to use the Mac Smart Switch app. That worked for everything except for text messages.

For some unknown reason it acts like it's starting to transfer it I do the iTunes backup I shut off iCloud messages. Finishes and then smart switch does it on he note 9 and it get to about 5% and says ""smart switch had stopped working"" 

I have tried to talking to Samsung Care and they said type on my phone dialer pad *#9900# to get the log files so I could send this to them so they can figure out. I just want to make sure I don't get stuck with $1,000 phone that isn't working the way I wanted to. I got to return the Best buy if I don't like.

I never wanted to update it. But the damn messages kept proping up and every time I said ""not now"".

a6l9lw,"I got my note 9 months ago. Right off the bat I noticed how in some applications and scenarios there was scroll lag much more noticeable than my s8. I sent the phone back to samsung and they supposedly fixed it. When I went to pick it up I decided to perform some tests on one of the phones in the store and it was the exact same thing. Then I went to another store on my way back home and tested yet another Note 9 and once again - the exact same issues. So don't come on here telling me that this is my problem.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been multiple updates and this phone still feels laggy if I start looking really close at the scroll when scrolling. Here are some of the problems:

&amp;#x200B;

* Samsung Internet on the S8 is SIGNIFICANTLY better scrolling wise (scrolling up and down with FINGER ON SCREEN)
* The horizontal scrolling in google search results (im talking about those tiles in the results such as videos) is also significantly smoother on the S8
* Google playstore's home page is also SOMETIMES smoother on the s8, many times it is equal between the two
* Twitter USED to be WAY worse on the Note 9 but it was fixed I guess
* There is also slightly more blur compared to the s8 with images and text when scrolling

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am going to say that the Note 9 boots faster and opens the majority of these apps SLIGHTLY faster, but the specs and whether or not you load something up slightly faster means NOTHING compared to how well it performs inside of the app itself. Even if one phone takes 5 extra seconds to load something but then performs significantly better once it's loaded, that phone is the winner, not the one that opened it first.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, why is this phone so terribly optimized for scrolling, why is this not getting updated ? This is supposed to be Samsung's most premium phone. I really don't get it. It is simply unacceptable to me for a brand new phone, released 1.5 years after the S8, with superior specs to be performing the same and slower in scrolling. It should be butter smooth. I don't know if they did this for a better battery life but quite frankly I CAN WIPE MY A$$ with a better battery life. Even when I used my s8 there were only a few times when I let it go below 50%. The only thing I am concerned about is 100% butter smooth performace that IS BETTER than my s8.",samsung,2018-12-16 02:12:15

​Faster animations -- Go on your Note 9 and go into the settings, enter developer options (if you don't know how to do this then click here ), next up just scroll down until you find Window animation scale, Transition animation scale and Animator duration scale. Default they are set on 1x, change them to 0.5x or even off if that suits you. After you have changed all of them, your device will feel a lot faster.✨

​Change your phone display resolution depending on what you are gonna do, personally I run the highest display setting which is 2960x1440 when watching movies, videos but when I play games I set it to the default resolution which is 2220x1080, perhaps you can go lower to 1480x720 if you have issues with frames when playing games but that should not be a problem on the Note 9.✨

a6q33t,Hey guys. I've recently purchased 65 '' Q9fn TV and the soundbar hw-n850. Apparently TV can't give an atmos signal throughout the arc hdmi port. Here comes my question. What kind of device would you recommend me to get in order to able to get Atmos signal? I've been thinking about some blu-ray player from Samsung. Also Xbox one is an option here. Although I would  want to be able to use one remote for all the devices so most probably I will choose a blu-ray. Which blu-ray model would be best for my setup?  Will I be able to use TV remote to control Blu-ray?  How the setup would look like? Do I need to connect Blu-ray through soundbar or tv? All the answers would be very much helpfully for me! I would love to finally try the Atmos at my place 😁,samsung,2018-12-16 15:59:49

a6vcis,"So last night after weeks of delaying my Galaxy S7 Edge's software update due to being scared of getting my phone stuck in a ""bootloop"", I downloaded and installed it and it got stuck in a bootloop. Now my phone is stuck in a eternal restart, installs to 50% and it resets. Over, and over again. I took it to a Samsung Phone Repair location and they told me since the screen has a crack, that Samsung doesn't let them fix the software issue until I buy a whole new screen for it. An S7 Edge screen cost $280 to install. Plus the charge for the software fix.   


So basically they are forcing me into paying for a new screen I don't need, to fix a problem thats totally unrelated.   
I don't know, maybe I'm missing something here and they are related to eachother, but i went to another store that wasn't partnered with Samsung to at least diagnose the problem and they took 40$ from me just to tell me they can't fix the issue due to not ""having the right equipment"".   


$800 dollar price tag on the phone + 40 for the pointless diagnoses + Them literally ruining my phone and refusing to fix it = My divorce from Samsung and Androids.

Except when we went to smart switch his data, the Apps and App Data selection was greyed out and said ""No Items"" even though there were around 30 apps installed. 

We took it to the Samsung Service Kiosk in the shopping mall I'm in and they couldn't get his apps to transfer with their management software either.

Both phones were completely up to date, we tried all the obvious stuff, the new Note 9 could receive apps from other phones but the S7 Edge couldn't send any apps anywhere.

It started happening last night, where I can use the phone as long as I want, however when I press the power button or let the phone auto timeout, the always on display will be on for about 30 seconds, and then the phone shuts off and reboots. 

From what I have read, articles suggest it is a software problem, but I have uninstalled every app except for the one I need to clock into work, removed the sd and sim, cleared the cache partition, and then a factory reset. The problem still persists.

The phone has never been dropped and I always have a drop proof case on it. I work outside, but none of my coworkers have a similar problem, so it's not environmental damage.

Is there anything else I can do to try to solve the problem? If it happens to be some hardware defect, why does it only happen when the phone is idle? Worst case scenario, will Samsung replace my device, or is the warranty only applicable to repairs?",samsung,2018-12-17 15:59:16

I already have Verizon and am using a LG G4 LOL so I couldn't really say no to this. However, my order is still processing. The website says it is waiting for carrier activation. Whatever. 

So I call up their customer support because it's been 10 days and they just told me it's the holidays and it's slow and wait another 5 or so business days. Seemed a little weird to me to wait another 5 days as it seems like a problem through Verizon? So I used their customer support chat and they then told me that there indeed was a problem that is preventing it from processing. Wouldn't tell me what the problem was, just kept assuring me that I'll get a confirmation email when it ships!!

Has anyone experienced anything like this? If I have to go ahead and call verizon myself I can obviously do that. Samsung wasn't very helpful at all.

Currently I'm an iPhone user, (hand-down previous gen, never bought my smartphone on my own and when the time comes, I'm going for Samsung for sure, but that's besides the point now...)  


So, I don't have much experience in online shopping in general, but I'd love to buy the perfect gift for my niece who has this [Samsung phone](https://imgur.com/a/EelMyqb). It's [J2 Pro](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_j2_pro_(2018)-8904.php), aka  ""Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime Pro"" as far as I'm concerned, and so far everything I saw online is either shady (probably different case will be delivered) or tacky.  


For instance, [this seems like the perfect case](https://www.amazon.com/Silicone-Cartoon-Unicorn-Rainbow-Fashion/dp/B07CGRJM6C/ref=mp_s_a_1_13?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545073506&amp;sr=8-13&amp;pi=AC_SX236_SY340_FMwebp_QL65&amp;keywords=samsung%20galaxy%20j2%20prime%20case%20for%20girls&amp;fbclid=IwAR3ffAn3x8htiAbd1YuMUcRpBsXulBNNsuiN1SCWh_qTnDcB5g-J7Vq95Ro) to get for her, however, besides the fact that it has just 1 image which looks shopped, it has no reviews, and  ANYA's (the seller on amazon) other items mostly don't have reviews. One that has reviews, for instance, [this one](https://www.amazon.com/IPhone-Fashion-Classic-Cartoon-Silicone/dp/B015WFQ8IK/ref=lp_9455863011_1_10?srs=9455863011&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545125248&amp;sr=8-10#customerReviews), it says that different case was delivered and that it was late on top of it all... so I'm suspicious of ANYA's quality of business...  


Second best would be [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B07H29X4QS/ref=dp_olp_0?ie=UTF8&amp;condition=all&amp;qid=1545122892&amp;sr=8-5), but similar thing here, no item reviews, and check out [this out](https://i.imgur.com/DEpz8mm.png)... somethings off right?  


I went to ebay too, which is basically diving head first into the unknown for me (never used it in my life, I'm living outside US btw)  


[This](https://www.ebay.com/itm/3D-Cartoon-Animals-Soft-Silicone-Case-For-Huawei-Mate-10-Lite-Samsung-J2-Pro/163329272177?hash=item26072ee971:m:mLERJa0JuqGVElfUoqnVsWA:rk:4:pf:0) seems like has the choice for Samsung Galaxy J2 Pro 2018 / Grand Prime Pro.... why both as different options? Could someone please let me know what would be the most secure way of getting a cute phone case that will be fit for model I need it to be fit for?  


I also snooped around on alibaba and found [this](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/3D-Rainbow-Diamond-TPU-Case-For_60797247919.html?spm=a2700.galleryofferlist.normalList.317.1db23b0dZVbUKo&amp;fbclid=IwAR2WFZXKGHHPDf9gyR1rc0ohbJ81txMwa4Yf5NCY4awDsUGgY6g0KhtKQ_c) option, which has [what looks like the right model case for J2](https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1g2HEvHwrBKNjSZPcq6xpapXaA/3D-Rainbow-Diamond-TPU-Case-For-Samsung.jpg_350x350.jpg), but no info in written form.  


Time of delivery is secondary, but still important. I hope someone can help me who has experience in online shopping. I hope you got the idea, Unicorns are best, cuter the better, the big ones are top choice if available (bigger than phone cases)... 

&amp;#x200B;

Like the battery drops like an iphone and im worried i messed my phone up. Im not sure if i can do anything other than getting a new phone? But i am glad my phone isnt bricked.,samsung,2018-12-18 13:50:25
a7ci61,"In Samsung Experience you could tap the three dots in the top right of the recent apps screen and there was a ""view as list"" option or something along those lines that made all the recently used apps show in a list form. This was one of my favorite things about Samsung's skin, but I don't see that option on the One UI Beta on my Note 9. Is it just not there or am I missing it? If it's not there that's super disappointing. I already left feedback requesting it be added back.",samsung,2018-12-18 16:21:49
a7eguq,"Hello! I currently have a S8 and I'm looking forward to upgrading my phone to another Samsung. I have an app installed which has its backing up disallowed, so Google won't backup this app. For those who don't know, Android apps' manifests can have a flag declared named ""allowBackup"", which is self explanatory :P . Its size is also abnormal, the data is around 3 GB. 

My question is: does Smart Switch still transfers/backups these apps to the new phone? 

Thanks in advance!",samsung,2018-12-18 19:45:19
a7erja,"Bought the note 9 through Samsung’s website, and it was confirmed and processed on Dec 15. Yesterday, I found out it was cancelled because “activation cannot be completed” and that I would need to contact my carrier to complete my purchase. 
Contacted AT&amp;T, all they did was told me to try to order it again later tonight or tomorrow. 
Has anyone had anything similar happen to them and how was it resolved? I tried google but I wasn’t able to find anyone with a similar issue. ",samsung,2018-12-18 20:16:26
a7erwn,"Hi I had a memo in the Memo app on my Samsung S7 and all the text in it (apart from the title) got erased. It had important information in it and I really want to get it back. I guess maybe I did something, and then saved but I don't remember doing anything like this, so maybe there's a different reason? Anyways is there a way for me to get the text back or if not then a way to ensure next time this happens I can? Thanks for the help",samsung,2018-12-18 20:17:36

a7flre,"I'm a bit confused about the shipping process with a TV I just ordered. I got my confirmation emails from Samsung with a delivery date of 12/28. I also got the tracking info for AGS so I looked it up on their website. I see that it's listed as in-transit and was apparently shipped from another part of my own state, with the same airport listed for both the origin and destination. It also lists a ship date of 12/17 and a part that says to call them to schedule appointment to setup delivery.

Should I actually bother calling AGS/is it possible they already have it locally and are just waiting on me? Or should I just assume the original date given by Samsung of 12/28 is correct.

Thank you!",samsung,2018-12-18 21:43:14

a7gftl,"I have owned a top of the line Samsung washer and dryer set for less than 2 years and they have been the worst purchase I have ever made. To start; after purchasing we found out that our washer was impacted by the exploding top recall and had to wait 6-9 months for a decision as to what Samsung would do to resolve. They ended up offering to reinforce the top and extend the warranty by a year or replace with a different Samsung dryer (reimbursing the fair market value of the current machine which is total bullshit considering a customer had her jaw smashed open by a faulty washer). Since we did not want a mis-matched pair we opted for the fix. Before they were able to schedule an appointment our dryer stopped working. This was covered under warranty and took 2 service visits, over more than a week, to diagnose and replace the motor. After they repaired the dryer they came to fix the washer and-in truth-I haven’t had issues with it since. However, approximately 1 month after the warranty ended the dryer began squealing like a herd (pack, flock?) or pigs being molested by dirty ole farmer joe. I opted to repair myself to save some cash and had to replace all 4 drum rollers at the cost of $40 and 3 hours of my time. I have now done this procedure 3 times and every time I have to scrub the inside of the machine to removes the rust and rubber shavings that come from the bad rollers. 

Samsung has/had a reputation for quality but due to my experience I will never buy an appliance from them again. After tearing down this dryer 3 times I can tell you it is just a larger and more cheaply built clone of every dirt-cheap dryer on the market with a slick paint job and stainless steel front panel. Anyone reading this wondering if they should buy a Samsung appliance...just get the LG.",samsung,2018-12-18 23:12:19

I have never had a Samsung phone before so this would be a good chance to try one, cos you know I'm all for the 'don't knock it till you try it' thing...

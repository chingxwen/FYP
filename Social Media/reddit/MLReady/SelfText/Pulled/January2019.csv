I have googled and tried clearing the app cache, the only other option is to clear the app data, however I can't seem to find a straight yes or no answer on whether doing this will delete the text messages. If it does, this obviously defeats the purpose as the texts I am trying to screenshot will be gone

abcnf6,Hello. I was wondering has anyone encountered major graphical issues regarding the Samsung Galaxy s6. Recently mine has started to have major graphical issues. This involves the screen clipping out. The screen replicating itself half way up the screen. The screen keyboard randomly moving about the screen and streteching text. Apps will get a square box around them when clicked which can range fom black and white lines to red and black and other odd graphical errors. I was wondering has anyone else experienced something similiar. Sorry for the long post and any spelling errors its difficult to type with the keyboard like this.,samsung,2018-12-31 23:38:24

It's hooked up to a Sapphire RX 580 8GB via a DP cable. I keep my PC as up to date as possible (update wise).

**Here's what's happening:**

When **browsing the internet** or going into settings or folders, I'll get some intermittent flickering and blinking. Not always, but occasionally. Most of the time it's fine, but like watching or turning on YouTube videos it'll quickly blink. Sometimes opening a new tab in Chrome or going to another web page will cause a quick flicker.

Surprisingly, it **DOES NOT** blink or flicker at all during gaming.

I did some searching and many say that the DP cable that comes with the display is trash and should be changed for a VESA certified cable... See below.

**Here's what I've tried:**  
\- Installing this driver off [Samsung.com](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/uhd-monitor-ue590-series) (when it downloads, the file name is U24E590.exe but I have a 28"" display)  
\- Uninstalling driver  
\- Changing my DP cable (bought an [ACCELL DP cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0098HW0EA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1), I got the 3' one)  
\- Changing setting to ""Fastest"" response time. I've also tried the other two, but no luck.  
\- Turning Game Mode on and off. Currently off.

Nothing seems to work. Still get intermittent blinking while only surfing the web. Asking for some friends!

acabzm,"I bought a Samsung 850 PRO 2 TB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-7KE2T0BW), put it in my laptop, and it never worked, failed/etc. I checked it with a SSD reader plugged into multiple laptops, showing it didn't read. I think it was a firmware update that happened automatically that bricked it. This is in retrospect, because I returned it, re-ordered, and reinstalled it into my laptop. This was sometime around July 2016.  That one bricked too, I never removed it, and finally bought a new laptop. I uninstalled that drive, and now it's basically Jan 2019, 2.5 years later.  It's a bad drive, originally both purchased from Amazon. Amazon wouldn't take a return (I think the seller was samsung, and immediately took back the first drive.

If I contact Samsung, will they take this drive back, doing what's right? Or is this spendy brick my own to love and hold forever, with no recourse?

acaetr,"Hello everyone, happy new year! How is everyone doing today?

I've been having issues with using my Galaxy Note 9 with a Dex Pad and a Smart TV.

For some reason, every time I open an app with Widevine DRM like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, I'm able to hear the audio from the TV, and I'm able to see the apps' UI, yet the video appears blank with a solid black instead.

I have contacted Samsung and was told that this happened because the Dex Pad is not compatible with the phone, even though my Galaxy S8+ used to have the same issue.

They blame the failure on a lack of bandwidth from the USB interface, and they are asking me to purchase an USB C to HDMI adapter to confirm where the issue lies.

acfe5j,"Let's suppose I have a Samsung phone/tablet that isn't in a known-good state. Maybe I've rooted it before. Maybe its firmware has had exploitable bugs (gotta love fragmentation and slow security updates) in the past and I'm not sure malware hasn't taken advantage of them. Maybe it's a used/refurbished device and I don't know what's been done with it before I bought it. Bottom line is, the /data might contain malicious apps, the /system might be infected with some malware that installed itself there using root privileges, and the boot loader might even be infected too. A factory reset will wipe out /data, but it doesn't touch /system.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm essentially looking for a way to restore a device to a fully-offical state using as few unofficial tools as possible. On iOS devices, putting the device in DFU (which AFAIK is baked into the hardware) and restoring with iTunes does the trick. Is there something comparable for Samsung devices? I've tried Kies and Smart Switch to no avail, as it says ""&lt;model name&gt; does not support initializing"" for all my test devices. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know there's Odin for flashing. Apparently this is a Samsung tool, but I can't just go to [samsung.com](https://samsung.com) and download it, as it's a leaked internal tool. Furthermore, the firmware files aren't officially available from Samsung, forcing users to rely on sites like SamMobile and Updato. Is there any way to confirm that firmwares from these sites are legitimate? Does the device do this automatically when the firmware is installed? 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do I even really need to worry about a corrupted /system? There are things like dm-verify that apparently try to ensure the (system?) partition is in a trusted state. I seem to remember certain apps (e.g., Avast Anti-Theft) being able to persistently install themselves on /system. Was this blocked by dm-verify?
2. If the bootloader were compromised, would there be any way to get the device back to known-good state? Couldn't the bootloader just lie to Odin/Kies/whatever and say it overwrote itself (with the known-good image) when it really didn't?
3. Is there a way to get Kies/Kies3/Smart Switch working. I'd prefer to use only officially-released software if possible. Also, where is there a concrete list of devices supported by these 3 tools?",samsung,2019-01-04 06:26:59

acorkc,"Hello, all. 2 days ago, I ran into an odd problem. I had set an alarm, and when I woke up after the alarm not going off, I noticed my phone had shut off. This was odd, as I have all power saving features disabled on my phone. Still, I went on with the day thinking this was possibly just a one-off thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the day went on, though, my phone more and more frequently shut down, eventually reaching the point where it will not stay on for even more than 30 seconds. 

&amp;#x200B;

The characteristic of the phone crashing is just going straight to a black screen, and not restarting. There is never a 'Samsung' shutdown logo. One thing that seems to relatively consistently trigger the shutdown is locking the phone, although this just causes the issue more quickly, and isn't the only cause. Additionally, one thing that almost completely prevents this shutdown is being in a phone call. The phone has only shut down once, in a phone call, and that was only after having it going for about 4 hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my efforts to try and resolve the issue, I first tried uninstalling all the apps I recently installed, and the phone still crashed. I then tried running the phone in safe mode, and it still crashed. I then tried doing a factory reset, and it still crashed. Finally, I fully flashed the phone using Odin3, and it still crashes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm reaching my wit's end with this issue, as the tech in me is saying that at this point, it's likely a hardware issue, except it makes no sense why being in a phone call would stop a hardware issue from crashing the phone.

I was planning on eventually bringing it out again once I had enough money to get it fixed up, so I could get all the pictures and videos I had saved on it off it and stored properly. 

I finally had enough to get it fixed up, went to retrieve it and found that the battery had bulged out so much that the case came apart.. 

I have two questions here:

Is this thing even safe to handle? It looks like the battery could burst any second.. Id like to take it to a repair shop but is it dangerous for even the repair guy to deal with at this point?

Is there anything I could do to get Samsung to fix this? This really doesnt seem like it should have happened in the first place. I left my old Nexus in storage for years before going back to it and it worked just like it did when i stored it.",samsung,2019-01-05 22:07:25

My carrier is Boost Mobile which is on the Sprint network and i bought the phone online through Boost Mobile's site since nobody had one in stock locally. My S6 was able to pair to my smart watch just fine but i cant get my S9 to pair. I've tried clearing the network cache, system cache, updated the phone to the latest version and all apps are currently up to date, i even tried turning NFC on for laughs. Of course nothing happened when i did.

I was able to get Smart Things to detect and pair to my watch. And in my blue tooth settings i can see it paired. But my watch says its not connected and the watch app on my phone doesn't see it connected to the phone. So it seems to me like its ""paired' but not connected. I think part of the reason why this is happening is Smart Things is changing the MAC address of the phone all the time. Whenever i try to pair through Smart Things, my watch keeps the same MAC address but, according to my watch, the MAC address available to pair to is a different one every time i scan. And every time i try to pair through the watch, i do get an alert on my phone asking if i want to pair to my watch. I don't understand why Smart Things is changing the MAC address all the time either, its not helping the situation.

I've contacted Samsung support and they recommend doing what i mentioned above, and also doing a factory reset, which i did already when i opened up the box. I normally do one in case it was ever tampered with. I don't want to do another factory reset because it took me several hours to set up my phone the way i wanted it and don't want to do it again. Worst case I'll go to the retailer to get them to look at it.

From what i can gather, the Casio watch uses Bluetooth v4.1 and the S9 uses Bluetooth v5. But Bluetooth v5 is supposed to be backwards compatible to work with my watch on v4.1. I'm also seeing a lot of posts regarding this same issue for a number of different products but none of their solutions, besides pairing through Smart Things, worked.

ad073g,"So I'm a complete noob in the world of credit cards, scores, reports, APR, etc. From what I understand, it seems that my credit score will be negatively impacted by just the application for financing, regardless of whether I get approved or not and that it can take some two years for the effects of that to be neutralized. I'm not terribly worried about that as I'm actively planning to not make any purchases that would even require any checking into of my credit (aside from apartment applications). I did one of those credit karma checks and got a pretty middle of the road score (670). I don't know how that translates into my odds of getting approval, but I'm only applying for like $500 of credit so I'm hoping the relatively low amount will improve my odds of approval.

I'm not really worried about being able to make payments because the monthly payment is only like $20 a month anyway. Though I have read some horror stories about TD Bank and their alleged inability to send bills out on time and then we the customer get stuck with a late fee we shouldn't have to pay. 

So I guess I'm asking this: for those of you who have successfully gotten approval for Samsung financing, was it worth it? What kind of credit score did you have when you got approved? Or even if you didn't apply but know some stuff about credit and whatnot, could you offer your insight?

However, with all this talk about One UI and with Samsung themselves starting the public/stable release to phone's on the 20th of December - it leaves me wondering, will I ever get this update? (Yes I am aware that January is the official timeline but I am getting worried).

I contacted Samsung yesterday through their live chat and they said I must find out where my phone was originally from. I didn't purchase directly from Samsung, however it was brand new and from a seller based in the UK (my SIM is also on a UK network (EE)).

My theory is this: if I put my phone into a state where it's not connected to any mobile network and reset it back to factory settings, will I potentially be able to get the update from the setup stage?

I was forced to update the firmware and the phone runs like shit now. Now I understand that companies push out bad firmwares Apple included and that’s why I wait to update so I can read the reviews of the update before changing the firmware of my phone that is working exactly how I want it to. Anyways back to my question seriously drawn out question, how can Samsung force a firmware update on a device that they do not own, in fact I would expect this from Apple first. And maybe I am missing a setting to turn that off but I have not been able to find it. Seems to me that Samsung pushed a bad firmware onto my device right at the time of their new phone releases but I didn’t get to chose to update.

ad92lz,"Hi Reddit:

I have a SM-G930FD that is stuck in Odin mode.  I believe I inadvertently trapped it in this mode trying different key combinations while attempting to reboot the phone after it froze while listening to Spotify.  I have tried a number of remedies so far but they have all failed.  I don't believe that a button is stuck because I can completely depress all of them and hear a click at the bottom of the press.  The phone has never been rooted and was running a stock ROM of whatever the newest android update was as of around Christmastime.  I live in the US and am on AT&amp;T's network.

&amp;#x200B;

I have:

\-Done all of the reset button combinations. Upon reboot, the Samsung splash screen comes up as normal, but then it does directly into the Downloading screen.  No menus or warnings, no prompts.

\-Completely drained the battery.  The initial freeze happened over a week ago and after letting it drain that first day and spending a lot of time trying to fix it, I left it alone to die.  Upon recharging, it goes directly into the downloading screen as if I had reset the device.

\-Tried some recovery software.  The only one I can remember off the top of my head was Dr Fone which didn't recognize the device and wouldn't work.

\-Tried to flash a new stock ROM.  I downloaded various ROMS (including some for FD versions and some for just the F version) from various sites and tried to flash them using Odin.  I tried doing just the AP as well as loading all of the other files (including trying both versions of the CSC file), and none were successful.  The most common error was something regarding a pit file. I think the phone was originally loaded with a middle eastern ROM as it included some sort of arabic news network with the original bloatware on the phone, but I am not sure exactly.  I purchased it open box from newegg almost three years ago and never had any problems before now, although there were some peculiarities with the phone including that I never received emergency notifications (other than the presidential one a little while back) and my phone's internal clock lagged a few minutes behind those of my friends, causing my contributions to group texts to appear out of order (although this never happened with individual texts or with certain other group texts).

Samsung Space Monitor SR75   
\#samsungspacemonitor #samsung #samsungSR75  


Hi Guys … welcome to 360 60 … the one place you get all your information in just 60 seconds.   


Samsung recently announced a cool monitor (Samsung Space Monitor SR75) with a unique design. And because I am a sucker for monitors… and cool design overall …  here it is.   
Supported by an adjustable arm stand,  the Samsung Space Monitor gives you extra desk space when you want it, and a close-up view when you need it.   
The stand clamps to the rear of a desk, letting the screen push all the way back against a wall or tilt and extend forward until it hits the desk surface — or sit anywhere in between.   
Probably you are tired of wire clutter behind your monitor. In this case, the SAMSUNG SPACE MONITOR will be the right solution for your clutterless and clean desk future.   
It's available in a QHD 27-inch model or 4K-resolution 32-inch variant.  The bigger, the better!  
All the cords are hidden into the arm for a clean look. But where did I see this before?! SAMSUNG SPACE MONITOR just somehow reminds me … of Microsoft surface in some way?! Do you agree?   
What do you think about the SAMSUNG SPACE MONITOR?! Is this a smart solution … or just a stupid design - we don't need?! Do you want to see a longer 360 seconds review …  Vote with a simple like or comment. And maybe  …  I will buy the monitor and do the in-depth analysis.   
See you in the next 360in60  …  please subscribe! Peace!

So I filed a return.

The return shipping was pretty slow, took 5 days. About 4 days after the phone was delivered back to the warehouse, I received the full amount back with no issues.

Now I'm back on the Note 9, and have a way better selfie camera on this unit. Just saw so many bad experiences with Samsung phone returns, thought I'd add the opposite experience.",samsung,2019-01-09 00:18:37

My phone is not under sunlight when charging.
I don't have an phone.
Critical Ops has consumed the most battery since last week with 367%, 0% on background and Samsung keyboard 256%, all while on background.

5.1 seems to be the highest version of android that the phone will automatically update to, but I've read online that I can manually upgrade to 6 (Marshmallow) or 7 (Nougat). I'm curious if I should or not?

I'm worried that the newer OS updates won't be well optimized for a phone this old and that it'll result in slowing down the phone's general use while also lowering the battery life.

I have reported it on their forums and through the app with a screenshot. I got a standard response on Samsung Members telling me to delete the App data, even though I stated that I already did that and I tried it with my wife's S9+ (final Pie firmware) too. On their web forums they also just tell people to delete the app data.

Besides the fact that this is not helpful at all I just want to rant how the hell they even thought this is the proper way to display the notification. Every media player app under the sun uses the colored Oreo style notifications. And the cover art is this shrunk abomination which expands when you expand the notification, BUT WHY.

Mostly, I was interested in using art programs on it, because I've heard that Samsung products have really good screens and styluses. I'd like to get into digital art and this tablet seems like a good option for the price. Just want something I can doodle on.

I know there are dedicated digital art tablets as well, but I'm also interested in just having a tablet/laptop I can have on the go for general use too (also dedicated hardware is a hard sell since I'm just interested at this point, but maybe later if I really get into it). Two birds, one stone you know?

But yeah, not sure how well anything will run on it. There doesn't seem to be a lot of agreement on whether Windows 10 on ARM is good or not. If not I'd be looking at one of the lower end Surface tablets instead (but that's a topic for a different subreddit).",samsung,2019-01-09 21:15:14

I'm definitely calling the Samsung Germany support tomorrow (that's gonna be interesting, seeing as I don't speak German) since it was the solution I found online, but on the meantime it doesn't hurt to ask on reddit, particularly to people who've bought their samsungs in Europe to take elsewhere, since it seems like a common problem.

aetw01,"I'm using my s3 for...everything these days. That includes a lot of drawing and painting. I like Infinite Painter and Infinite Design. I've used those across an original note 10 tab, a note 10.1 2014, and this S3. I really like Autodesk Sketchbook and Sculpt+ too. Haven't really delved outside those. Anything else I should be checking out? CAD stuff is one thing I *need* to do on a PC, so idc about those.

In my stylus collection, I have a cheapo friendly swede stylus with a couple tips. Old school mesh bubble tip, fine point fiber tip, one of those disc tips, and the reason I bought it. A capacitive paint brush. Works pretty nice too. No pressure flow controls, but it's kinda fun using an actual paintbrush. I also have a decent rechargeable copper nib pen, the OEM pen, a pen that was sold as OEM but is clearly a knockoff, one of the old bamboo for samsung. The ones that looked like an actual nice pen, and it had that big fat nib. And the norris pencil. 

Out of the bunch, I'm pretty much in love with the norris pencil. The really fine tip and the extra length is beautiful when you're drawing. I actually bought extra nibs as soon as I'd used it just to make sure I never run out, lol. The stock pen and the knockoff are functionally identical. Stock feels a little heavier, but they write exactly the same. It's a vast improvement over the teeny slide out note stylus on the 10 and 10.1, but it's not terribly fun to draw with. It will do, but it's way better for handwriting and s pen functions.

The copper tipped stylus is basically my all purpose tool. You gotta charge it, but it lasts like 8 hours. The tip won't wear out from Swype typing, and it doesn't seem to be damaging my screen protector at all. It was 15 bucks, I think. Not great for drawing and painting. No pressure sensitivity or hand rejection. Real nice for games though. Playing through TWEWY with it was great. 

The old bamboo for samsung still works well. It has kind of an annoying level of offset, but you can adjust. I love how that fat nib feels on the screen, so I keep it in rotation.

Are there any other pressure sensitive emr stylus out there? I'd love to add more tips and paperfeel to the arsenal?",samsung,2019-01-11 09:54:00

af09l6,"The Galaxy Watch looks really nice.  For the most part it's a decent watch.  But there's a huge flaw in it's fitness tracking algorithm:  it does not take into account your weight or heart rate when calculating calories burned.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance,  if I weigh 300 pounds and do 30 minutes worth of jumping jacks, I am going to burn way more calories than I would if I weighed 150.  Also, if my heart is beating faster during walking, I will obviously also be burning more calories.  The Galaxy Watch shows the exact same number of calories burned for each exercise, regardless of our individual weight or heart rate - DESPITE THE FACT that I have told the watch how much I weighed, and it's always reading my heart rate.

&amp;#x200B;

This is ridiculous.  I can spend 90% less on other watches that will correctly count calories.  What's sad is even though many people have submitted similar feedback to Samsung, the only response they ever give is that they ""will forward the information to the correct department.""  I am a huge consumer of Samsung products and this is simply lazy, unacceptable, and the information needs to be more widespread so they can address the issue.  It's something that could literally be fixed in a software update.

&amp;#x200B;

When you choose a carrier model, say AT&amp;T you see the carrier -$200 discount. That brings the phone from 999 to 799.

You then elect to trade in a note 8 as well, which is currently valued at $300. Which would then bring the price from 799 to $499. However, when you go to pay in full... the price goes up by $200, 499 to 699.

&amp;#x200B;

What gives samsung? Why show me the discount but not let me do the trade in as well? That's essentially paying me only $100 for the note 8 as opposed to the carrier who gives me $200. Why should I then trade it in instead of selling it via a 3rd party and getting the $200 off from the carrier?

I'm only asking because my first android phone was a S7 Edge, before that I always had an iPhone. I got a Note 8 and gave my mom the S7 Edge, she dropped the phone a lot of times and the front and back are cracked. The phone still works fine and I want to replace the front and back just because its my first Android and Samsung phone but Samsung wants 279.99 plus tax for the front and 59.99 plus tax for the back which seems like a lot. If I could get a new legit S7 Edge for around that much money I would rather just do that.",samsung,2019-01-13 22:09:48

afs3xt,"Hi there

I've got a note 8 for about 3 months. Bought brand new, from local store, the phone is in perfect condition, no scratches, had case from day one. 
Never put it in the same pocket with other items, it always had its own pocket. 

The question is, could the screen crack from sudden temp changes? I was charging it with a wireless charger, which causes it to overheat a little. I went out to buy some groceries, mid winter, -10 to -15 Celsius degrees. Had the phone in my jacket's chest pocket, on the inside. Upon arriving at the store where it was warm and waiting in line to pay, I wanted to check my account balance and noticed the crack http://imgur.com/a/N0C7BE9 . It went from the speaker into 6 different directions. I couldn't have smashed it against anything, as it was right on my chest. Is it possible to get it replaced by Samsung? I've seen some other people complaining about this issue. I went to the local store and they said there is no such thing and it can only be fixed by paying 400$. 

I don't need you to believe me, but I want you to, please try to walk a mile in my shoes. Please give an honest opinion, I cared for my baby since day 0 and I never ever dropped it. ",samsung,2019-01-14 04:31:24

aft7e2,"I just recently a few months ago bought 2x Samsung smart TVs (nu7100)  since I've have a smart things hub the past few years and wanted to upgrade not only to 4k but to integrate them into smart things. Now for my issues.. these TV's randomly turn on ALL THE TIME.  They don't work 90% of the time via the old or new smart things app and the apps always say they are on or off when in reality they aren't. I haven't been a huge Samsung user but since they bought out smarthings I thought I'd try some of their stuff. 

Which makes me wonder does anything they make work?? These TV's have so many issues other then what I just listed, their cloud is down almost 1-2 times a week making my smart home offline and my roommate is on his 4th s9+ because hardware issues keep popping up.. I won't even start of their smart things hub 3 issues..

ag3iub,"I am renting a place I live in 60% of the time for work. The landlord is on a long term trip. We email but he's pretty hands off.

The Samsung washer stopped working before Christmas. Landlord had a friend come to check it while I was away and the friend couldn't fix it but luckily it's still under warranty. I returned to the house last week and called Samsung after a few days of back and forth with the landlord. They took all the model/serial info, the address, place and time of purchase, etc. Asked me if I was in front of the machine so I could troubleshoot. I said no but asked if they could ask me the troubleshooting questions so I could confirm if I did them. They refused, gave me a ticket number and asked me to call back.

I call back from the house, give the ticket number and they still make me go through the model/serial number, address, place and time of purchase. The troubleshooting questions are ""is it plugged in"" and ""did you flip the breaker."" I'm like ""well, I don't have a gaping head wound and you could have asked me that off the bat."" Then the guy asks for the receipt. I don't have it, I'm a tenant. He assures me that he can still set up the ticket without it and that I should have talked to him the first time I called because he would have got this sorted out. I have to text a photo of the model and serial number to him and then I should text a photo of the receipt to the same number when I get it--BUT THEY ARE SENDING OUT THE TICKET NOW. I

That was Friday. I called the only service place within 300 km today to check on the ticket status. They didn't have it--we chatted and figured out some strategies to make sure they were able to come out to my area the same days that I am actually out there. I call the appliance store, they send me the receipt PDF and I text it to Samsung. I call Samsung because I don't trust them. I give them the ticket number. They ask me for serial/model and I'm just like like ""I. Already. Did. This. Why. Is. There. A. Ticket. Number. If; You Aren't. Saving. Information."" I tell them I texted the PDF and I want to confirm that the service is scheduled. The guy is like ""oh, no, you need to send this to an email address and then they will schedule the service. I will generate the email address.""

I was polite but clearly not happy. I asked him why the last person told me I could text the photo and asked why they are using three different communication methods to get this serviced. My displeasure resulted in him supposedly creating my ticket and submitting it to the service company while I was on the phone with him. He put me on hold, told me that I didn't need to send the receipt in (BUT I DID) and then said that I'd get a call soon to book the service appointment. I asked if it was the repair company and he said he couldn't say. I'd rather have just emailed the email address and get confirmation in writing that something had been done.

I don't understand Samsung's MO here. Like, if I spend a couple thousand on a washing machine, I'm going to want it fixed under the warranty. They already have my (landlord's) money. This is customer retention. I was already never going to buy another Samsung phone again, now I will never buy another Samsung product.",samsung,2019-01-15 02:19:13

So somewhere in the past year, they halved the points for transactions. I actually completely forgot Platinum level gave 40 points until I just saw it. It's now 5, 10, 15, 20 points depending on your level.

Furthering that, they only allow 50 transactions per month, giving a potential max of 12,000 points per year. Furthering even more.. points expire after a year. You literally can't even bank enough points for the 3 current featured rewards that cost 20,000 points. You can't even get a SmartThings Hub at 14,000 points without buying more points. The biggest feature they removed was being able to buy a Visa Gift Card with your points.

That all being said, is it even worth it now? I literally have to fumble with my phone in order to get it working flawlessly about 50% of the time. I even have to wait a hot second for it to open and start the payment process so there are times I could've just pulled out a credit card and it would've been faster. There are also times where it just won't work 3 times in a row and I ended up using a credit card anyway.  I was literally only using it for the points but they seem worthless at this point.

The cool thing was if I stopped the car and the phone disconnected I could simply pick up where I left off the next time I start driving. It pauses automatically and then continues, very convenient.  

Now, after having upgraded to S9, the book (the audio file) starts from the beginning every time I disconnect from the car Bluetooth. I tried manually pausing from my phone before turning off the engine and disconnecting, but no use; the seekbar still went back to the beginning of the book.

I decided to finally write up the oh so pleasant experiences i've had with Samsung support. Due to these experiences (and the fact that their phones always because super slow 6 months in) i can no longer recommend any samsung devices to anybody, and i avoid them whenever possible, even though they have some cool shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

My experiences with Samsung: (loooooooong)

&amp;#x200B;

My galaxy s2 bricks while performing a standard factory reset. Goes to a screen with an error that says its corrupted and to contact samsung. I call samsung and they just keep saying it shouldnt have happened, but not offering a resolution. They refuse to take it or do anything about it, and keep trying to shift the blame to me. Finally they agree to look at it, for a service fee of around $60. I keep pushing, and getting transferred and move to different managers, and after 5 hours of talking/waiting, they agree to fix it for free. I ship it in and wait 4 weeks and get nothing in response. I contact them and they say that after reviewing it (2 weeks ago) they decided its out of warranty, and my options are: A. Pay $120 for service/replacement (needs a new component), or B. Pay $15 for return shipping and handling, and evaluation time. Essentially the phone is being held hostage until i pay them something. I spend another 3 hours arguing with them on the phone, and explaining how they already said they would repair it for free. Finally they agree to repair it. 2 weeks later i get the phone back, and now it boots. Problem is that they damaged the power button while repairing it (or gave me somebody elses device, mine had no scratches, and this one was dinged on the sides). The power button didnt spring back out right, so it was difficult to press, and would periodically trigger itself. Locking and unlocking the device on its own at first, then turning the phone on and off by itself, progressing (over the course of just 4 days) to pressing itself constantly. so now it cant be booted up at all. I contact them again, and this time they just flat out refuse to do anything about it at all, no matter how much i press. Phone was a loss.

&amp;#x200B;

Galaxy note 4 develops ridiculous burnin (through normal use) within 7 months. Screen has so many competing burnin images that none of the colors are showing right. Something very defective. (and the burn-in development went from almost none to a shit load in the period of about a month). I contact samsung and they say that burn-in is just a natural side effect of amoled panels, but doesnt usually develop til around 1.5-2.5 years, so i have nothing to worry about. I keep explaining that i ALREADY have it, and they keep brushing it off saying its normal, but wont happen yet. I tried going to managers and nothing changed. I waited a week and called again, this time using my wifes name (it was her phone anyway) and number to get a clean ticket. Now the tone was not that its normal, but that screen DAMAGE (what they called it) was not covered under warranty, and is only covered under the accidental damage plan. No amount of talking changed this. No repair or replacement was given.

&amp;#x200B;

My wifes 2 week old galaxy s7 edge swells up and cracks while charging on the counter overnight. You could clearly see the the cracks and swollen area (not splitting open swollen, but you could see a different in thickness in that area, increasing towards the center of the cracks). The phone was in pristine condition on the front and sides, and camera area, and it was obvious it had never been dropped. I called and they immediately accused me of dropping the phone and trying to lie to get a replacement, i offered to show them photos of the area (which did show it quite well). They said thats not something that could happen, and that if i dont have accidental coverage, it would be $300 for the repair. I explain that since it happened, the phone battery only lasts about 45 minutes, and if i put it on the charger it heats up and stops charging periodically. They say that this was just a result of me dropping the phone. I start getting too frustrated after 2 hours so i stop for the day. I have my brother call for me the next day (under my name), since he has used samsungs for a while, and he seems to know the necessary tricks to getting appropriate service from him. This time the idea samsung kept pushing was that if the battery swelled up, that means my wife was using a bad/unapproved charger. My wife had recently switched from iphone, and the only charger she owned was the official samsung charger. They kept fighting it, but since their chosen argument was that the battery swelled because of a battery charger, they sort of backed themselves into a corner because they could no longer say that the battery couldnt cause that damaged. They eventually agreed to repair it. I send it in, and 3 weeks later i receive the device as it was. I contact them and they say that the repair was denied, due to there being damage to the back panel (which they claim is an automatic void of warranty, no matter what the issue is). I argue that they already knew the back was broken and thats why i sent it in, they say that that doesnt make sense, as it wouldnt be approved. I eventually convice them to take it back and repair it. 4 weeks later ive heard nothing, i call and they say again that the repair has been denied due to a broken panel. They say i either pay a discounted $150 to get it repaired, or they can ship it back for free (at least no more holding it ransom). I send them text transcripts and recordings from the phone calls, showing the multiple instances in which I stated the glass was broken, and the multiple times they said they understood, and the multiple times they said they would repair anyway. I send the clips in which reps finally admitted this was likely their problem, and a conversation from the last time i talked to them, where they said they promise they will fix it even though it is cracked. They finally just send me a new/refurb one. Combined 12 hours on the phone/chat for this issue.

&amp;#x200B;

The left earbud on my Icon X wireless earbuds stops working correctly (super super low volume). I contact them and they say make me go through over an hour of basic troubleshooting, often repeating the same exact steps. Finally they say they will fix it, but they need an original proof or purchase or receipt. I obviously dont have this (who would? i received it 8 months prior, for christmas, from my wife). And they say that there is absolutely nothing they can do for me unless i have the receipt. I search everywhere i can think of, and ask my wife where she got it, turns out she bought them from a local independent tmobile store, which has since closed and turned into an official Metro PCS store. They cant provide me with a copy of the receipt. I argue for hours that the warranty cant be tied to a receipt, and just because i no longer have that doesnt mean i shouldn't get service. A manager finally agrees, and i get it in writing from him saying ""repair will not be denied do due lack of proof of purchase"". He says that since the serial number i provided them appears to be in warranty, it should be fine after all. I send them in. 5 weeks go by and nothing. I contact them (with an idea of where this is going), and they say that the repair has been approved, but they are backed up. They said to call again in a week. I call again, and they have no info. They cant tell me anything. 3 days later i get an email saying that my repair has been denied, due to failure to include proof of purchase in the box. I call them and get a different dept now, they say that its been denied and that i cant do anything about it now, since they have been waiting for me to respond to this for 3 weeks, and said that they might have been able to approve it without proof of purchase, Had i at any point given them the serial number. I explain that i already provided the serial number in the beginning, and that i have contacted them multiple times. He keeps saying that i am mistaken and that since his records dont show that i contacted them, then its not true. He also says that since his records dont show that i gave them a serial number, then that means i did not, and he keeps repeating that i am just mistaken. I find the transcript of when i sent the serial number and send it to him. he says that there is no way to verify that was from a samsung ticket chat. I give him the chat number and tell him to look it up, and he refuses. Finally he does and he apologizes saying that it looks like i did in fact give them the serial. He then says that he looked it up and it shows that its out of warranty (i know at this point that he is just lying out his ass, and the headphones are 8 months old). I get transfered to management and I explain what happened, they said that no matter what i need a proof of purchase. I show him the time the other manager said that they repair would be approved and the new guy says he doesnt know why the other guy said that, and that it wont be approved. An hour later he agrees to repair it. 7 days later i get the headphones back, still broken, with a paper inside saying they were sent back due to missing proof of purchase. I try contacting them again, and they wouldn't even allow me to open or continue my ticket, as it was marked as repaired and fulfilled.",samsung,2019-01-15 16:18:26

aggae3,"Samsung consistently is at the forefront of all of these smartphone technological breakthrough's but never gets to reap the rewards of being first on the scene because they get beaten. 

I remember samsung talking about bendable phones for literally 5 years. They finally ""are on the verge of releasing one"" (If i had a dollar for every time i heard that...) and now it is officially possible to purchase a phone that folds in half. 

Now I know what you're thinking ""well hey, being the ABSOLUTE first person to do something isn't as important as being the first BIG name company to push it to mass market"" and I agree. If a no-name chinese smartphone beats you its because their standard of quality is way lower. We all remember the shitty in-fingerprint display phones of the last year that used inferior technology and had none of the polish of modern flagship smartphones. 

But its not just small little no-name companies anymore. The oneplus 6t has an in-screen finger print reader. As someone in a computer science program, I always see people with oneplus phones even though most americans had never heard of them. But now that they're available on a major US retailer, they've officially become the first phone with an in-fingerprint display available on a nationwide american carrier. 

And now the hole-punch notch. Just like I said before, I understand that new tech needs more polish on a large phone maker like samsung than some rinky-dink phone company. Which is why samsung wanted to put their infinity-o display on a lower end phone first to get all the kinks worked out. Well now huawei (a major us phone maker) has a phone out with a hole-punch display. 

My point is: is samsung taking TOO long in the R&amp;D phase of their projects?

Samsung has always been a beacon of great hardware in the sea of android phones. Where the pixel is the king of software, samsung has always been the pioneer with hardware. But now... they seem to be lagging behind. 

I know in some regards, ""lagging behind"" is good. 3.5 mm headphone jack and no notch is great. But thats starting to seem less of a power move by samsung and more of a symptom of them just being too slow. ",samsung,2019-01-16 02:10:20

It's hooked up to a Sapphire RX 580 8GB via a DP cable. I keep my PC as up to date as possible (update wise).

**Here's what's happening:**

When **browsing the internet** or going into settings or folders, I'll get some intermittent flickering and blinking. Not always, but occasionally. Most of the time it's fine, but like watching or turning on YouTube videos it'll quickly blink. Sometimes opening a new tab in Chrome or going to another web page will cause a quick flicker.

Surprisingly, it **DOES NOT** blink or flicker at all during gaming.

I did some searching and many say that the DP cable that comes with the display is trash and should be changed for a VESA certified cable... See below.

**Here's what I've tried:**  
\- Installing this driver off [Samsung.com](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/uhd-monitor-ue590-series) (when it downloads, the file name is U24E590.exe but I have a 28"" display)  
\- Uninstalling driver  
\- Changing my DP cable (bought an [ACCELL DP cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0098HW0EA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1), I got the 3' one)  
\- Changing setting to ""Fastest"" response time. I've also tried the other two, but no luck.  
\- Turning Game Mode on and off. Currently off.

Nothing seems to work. Still get intermittent blinking while only surfing the web. Asking for some friends!

I have experienced this with almost all the phones I have owned in the past, with the exception of the Note 9. I have NO idea how on earth I haven't gotten a bad micro-scratch yet. I literally use it every single day in a gym/weight room environment.

ac830b,So I am in the market to buy a new tablet and was looking at the Samsung Galaxy Ta s4 that came out a few months ago. I started researching about it online and came across a website predicting that there will be a new s5 most likely coming out in the beginning of the 2019 year. Has anyone else heard of this prediction? Is it worth it to wait or should I just go ahead and get the s4? I'm not the type of person to keep upgrading when a new one comes out so when I buy it I want it to last a few years. Thanks so much. ,samsung,2019-01-03 17:45:42

I've been having issues with using my Galaxy Note 9 with a Dex Pad and a Smart TV.

For some reason, every time I open an app with Widevine DRM like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, I'm able to hear the audio from the TV, and I'm able to see the apps' UI, yet the video appears blank with a solid black instead.

I have contacted Samsung and was told that this happened because the Dex Pad is not compatible with the phone, even though my Galaxy S8+ used to have the same issue.

They blame the failure on a lack of bandwidth from the USB interface, and they are asking me to purchase an USB C to HDMI adapter to confirm where the issue lies.

acfe5j,"Let's suppose I have a Samsung phone/tablet that isn't in a known-good state. Maybe I've rooted it before. Maybe its firmware has had exploitable bugs (gotta love fragmentation and slow security updates) in the past and I'm not sure malware hasn't taken advantage of them. Maybe it's a used/refurbished device and I don't know what's been done with it before I bought it. Bottom line is, the /data might contain malicious apps, the /system might be infected with some malware that installed itself there using root privileges, and the boot loader might even be infected too. A factory reset will wipe out /data, but it doesn't touch /system.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm essentially looking for a way to restore a device to a fully-offical state using as few unofficial tools as possible. On iOS devices, putting the device in DFU (which AFAIK is baked into the hardware) and restoring with iTunes does the trick. Is there something comparable for Samsung devices? I've tried Kies and Smart Switch to no avail, as it says ""&lt;model name&gt; does not support initializing"" for all my test devices. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know there's Odin for flashing. Apparently this is a Samsung tool, but I can't just go to [samsung.com](https://samsung.com) and download it, as it's a leaked internal tool. Furthermore, the firmware files aren't officially available from Samsung, forcing users to rely on sites like SamMobile and Updato. Is there any way to confirm that firmwares from these sites are legitimate? Does the device do this automatically when the firmware is installed? 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do I even really need to worry about a corrupted /system? There are things like dm-verify that apparently try to ensure the (system?) partition is in a trusted state. I seem to remember certain apps (e.g., Avast Anti-Theft) being able to persistently install themselves on /system. Was this blocked by dm-verify?
2. If the bootloader were compromised, would there be any way to get the device back to known-good state? Couldn't the bootloader just lie to Odin/Kies/whatever and say it overwrote itself (with the known-good image) when it really didn't?
3. Is there a way to get Kies/Kies3/Smart Switch working. I'd prefer to use only officially-released software if possible. Also, where is there a concrete list of devices supported by these 3 tools?",samsung,2019-01-04 06:26:59

acorkc,"Hello, all. 2 days ago, I ran into an odd problem. I had set an alarm, and when I woke up after the alarm not going off, I noticed my phone had shut off. This was odd, as I have all power saving features disabled on my phone. Still, I went on with the day thinking this was possibly just a one-off thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the day went on, though, my phone more and more frequently shut down, eventually reaching the point where it will not stay on for even more than 30 seconds. 

&amp;#x200B;

The characteristic of the phone crashing is just going straight to a black screen, and not restarting. There is never a 'Samsung' shutdown logo. One thing that seems to relatively consistently trigger the shutdown is locking the phone, although this just causes the issue more quickly, and isn't the only cause. Additionally, one thing that almost completely prevents this shutdown is being in a phone call. The phone has only shut down once, in a phone call, and that was only after having it going for about 4 hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my efforts to try and resolve the issue, I first tried uninstalling all the apps I recently installed, and the phone still crashed. I then tried running the phone in safe mode, and it still crashed. I then tried doing a factory reset, and it still crashed. Finally, I fully flashed the phone using Odin3, and it still crashes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm reaching my wit's end with this issue, as the tech in me is saying that at this point, it's likely a hardware issue, except it makes no sense why being in a phone call would stop a hardware issue from crashing the phone.

I've tried clearing the network cache, system cache, updated the phone to the latest version and all apps are currently up to date, i even tried turning NFC on for laughs. Of course nothing happened when i did.

I was able to get Smart Things to detect and pair to my watch. And in my blue tooth settings i can see it paired. But my watch says its not connected and the watch app on my phone doesn't see it connected to the phone. So it seems to me like its ""paired' but not connected. I think part of the reason why this is happening is Smart Things is changing the MAC address of the phone all the time. Whenever i try to pair through Smart Things, my watch keeps the same MAC address but, according to my watch, the MAC address available to pair to is a different one every time i scan. And every time i try to pair through the watch, i do get an alert on my phone asking if i want to pair to my watch. I don't understand why Smart Things is changing the MAC address all the time either, its not helping the situation.

I've contacted Samsung support and they recommend doing what i mentioned above, and also doing a factory reset, which i did already when i opened up the box. I normally do one in case it was ever tampered with. I don't want to do another factory reset because it took me several hours to set up my phone the way i wanted it and don't want to do it again. Worst case I'll go to the retailer to get them to look at it.

From what i can gather, the Casio watch uses Bluetooth v4.1 and the S9 uses Bluetooth v5. But Bluetooth v5 is supposed to be backwards compatible to work with my watch on v4.1. I'm also seeing a lot of posts regarding this same issue for a number of different products but none of their solutions, besides pairing through Smart Things, worked. 

Does anyone have any recommendations/solutions? I really don't want to get another smart watch, i just bought this watch 6 months ago and it ain't cheap either.",samsung,2019-01-05 22:11:48

ad073g,"So I'm a complete noob in the world of credit cards, scores, reports, APR, etc. From what I understand, it seems that my credit score will be negatively impacted by just the application for financing, regardless of whether I get approved or not and that it can take some two years for the effects of that to be neutralized. I'm not terribly worried about that as I'm actively planning to not make any purchases that would even require any checking into of my credit (aside from apartment applications). I did one of those credit karma checks and got a pretty middle of the road score (670). I don't know how that translates into my odds of getting approval, but I'm only applying for like $500 of credit so I'm hoping the relatively low amount will improve my odds of approval.

I'm not really worried about being able to make payments because the monthly payment is only like $20 a month anyway. Though I have read some horror stories about TD Bank and their alleged inability to send bills out on time and then we the customer get stuck with a late fee we shouldn't have to pay. 

So I guess I'm asking this: for those of you who have successfully gotten approval for Samsung financing, was it worth it? What kind of credit score did you have when you got approved? Or even if you didn't apply but know some stuff about credit and whatnot, could you offer your insight?

However, with all this talk about One UI and with Samsung themselves starting the public/stable release to phone's on the 20th of December - it leaves me wondering, will I ever get this update? (Yes I am aware that January is the official timeline but I am getting worried).

I contacted Samsung yesterday through their live chat and they said I must find out where my phone was originally from. I didn't purchase directly from Samsung, however it was brand new and from a seller based in the UK (my SIM is also on a UK network (EE)).

My theory is this: if I put my phone into a state where it's not connected to any mobile network and reset it back to factory settings, will I potentially be able to get the update from the setup stage?

I was forced to update the firmware and the phone runs like shit now.

And maybe I am missing a setting to turn that off but I have not been able to find it.

ad92lz,"Hi Reddit:

I have a SM-G930FD that is stuck in Odin mode.  I believe I inadvertently trapped it in this mode trying different key combinations while attempting to reboot the phone after it froze while listening to Spotify.  I have tried a number of remedies so far but they have all failed.  I don't believe that a button is stuck because I can completely depress all of them and hear a click at the bottom of the press.  The phone has never been rooted and was running a stock ROM of whatever the newest android update was as of around Christmastime.  I live in the US and am on AT&amp;T's network.

&amp;#x200B;

I have:

\-Done all of the reset button combinations. Upon reboot, the Samsung splash screen comes up as normal, but then it does directly into the Downloading screen.  No menus or warnings, no prompts.

\-Completely drained the battery.  The initial freeze happened over a week ago and after letting it drain that first day and spending a lot of time trying to fix it, I left it alone to die.  Upon recharging, it goes directly into the downloading screen as if I had reset the device.

\-Tried some recovery software.  The only one I can remember off the top of my head was Dr Fone which didn't recognize the device and wouldn't work.

\-Tried to flash a new stock ROM.  I downloaded various ROMS (including some for FD versions and some for just the F version) from various sites and tried to flash them using Odin.  I tried doing just the AP as well as loading all of the other files (including trying both versions of the CSC file), and none were successful.  The most common error was something regarding a pit file. I think the phone was originally loaded with a middle eastern ROM as it included some sort of arabic news network with the original bloatware on the phone, but I am not sure exactly.  I purchased it open box from newegg almost three years ago and never had any problems before now, although there were some peculiarities with the phone including that I never received emergency notifications (other than the presidential one a little while back) and my phone's internal clock lagged a few minutes behind those of my friends, causing my contributions to group texts to appear out of order (although this never happened with individual texts or with certain other group texts).

adrefz,"Hi all,

I'm thinking of buying an S9 in Hong Kong as it's cheaper brand new compared to where I live. The phone band won't be a problem as it's compatible with my country's 4g network.

My question is, the phone will come with a 3 prong charger. Would there be any problem if I use my current Samsung fast charger, that is 2 prong only?

Also, are there any other differences I should look into before I buy a phone abroad?

Thanks!",samsung,2019-01-08 06:17:26

Samsung Space Monitor SR75   
\#samsungspacemonitor #samsung #samsungSR75  


Hi Guys … welcome to 360 60 … the one place you get all your information in just 60 seconds.   


Samsung recently announced a cool monitor (Samsung Space Monitor SR75) with a unique design. And because I am a sucker for monitors… and cool design overall …  here it is.   
Supported by an adjustable arm stand,  the Samsung Space Monitor gives you extra desk space when you want it, and a close-up view when you need it.   
The stand clamps to the rear of a desk, letting the screen push all the way back against a wall or tilt and extend forward until it hits the desk surface — or sit anywhere in between.   
Probably you are tired of wire clutter behind your monitor. In this case, the SAMSUNG SPACE MONITOR will be the right solution for your clutterless and clean desk future.   
It's available in a QHD 27-inch model or 4K-resolution 32-inch variant.  The bigger, the better!  
All the cords are hidden into the arm for a clean look. But where did I see this before?! SAMSUNG SPACE MONITOR just somehow reminds me … of Microsoft surface in some way?! Do you agree?   
What do you think about the SAMSUNG SPACE MONITOR?! Is this a smart solution … or just a stupid design - we don't need?! Do you want to see a longer 360 seconds review …  Vote with a simple like or comment. And maybe  …  I will buy the monitor and do the in-depth analysis.   
See you in the next 360in60  …  please subscribe! Peace!

The return shipping was pretty slow, took 5 days. About 4 days after the phone was delivered back to the warehouse, I received the full amount back with no issues.

My phone is not under sunlight when charging.
I don't have an phone.

I'm worried that the newer OS updates won't be well optimized for a phone this old and that it'll result in slowing down the phone's general use while also lowering the battery life.

I got a standard response on Samsung Members telling me to delete the App data, even though I stated that I already did that and I tried it with my wife's S9+ (final Pie firmware) too. On their web forums they also just tell people to delete the app data.

Besides the fact that this is not helpful at all I just want to rant how the hell they even thought this is the proper way to display the notification.

Mostly, I was interested in using art programs on it, because I've heard that Samsung products have really good screens and styluses. I'd like to get into digital art and this tablet seems like a good option for the price. Just want something I can doodle on.

I know there are dedicated digital art tablets as well, but I'm also interested in just having a tablet/laptop I can have on the go for general use too (also dedicated hardware is a hard sell since I'm just interested at this point, but maybe later if I really get into it). Two birds, one stone you know?

But yeah, not sure how well anything will run on it. There doesn't seem to be a lot of agreement on whether Windows 10 on ARM is good or not. If not I'd be looking at one of the lower end Surface tablets instead (but that's a topic for a different subreddit).",samsung,2019-01-09 21:15:14

I'm on Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge 
Android 8.0.0

No option to disable when I longpress the notification.

aetw01,"I'm using my s3 for...everything these days. That includes a lot of drawing and painting. I like Infinite Painter and Infinite Design. I've used those across an original note 10 tab, a note 10.1 2014, and this S3. I really like Autodesk Sketchbook and Sculpt+ too. Haven't really delved outside those. Anything else I should be checking out? CAD stuff is one thing I *need* to do on a PC, so idc about those.

In my stylus collection, I have a cheapo friendly swede stylus with a couple tips. Old school mesh bubble tip, fine point fiber tip, one of those disc tips, and the reason I bought it. A capacitive paint brush. Works pretty nice too. No pressure flow controls, but it's kinda fun using an actual paintbrush. I also have a decent rechargeable copper nib pen, the OEM pen, a pen that was sold as OEM but is clearly a knockoff, one of the old bamboo for samsung. The ones that looked like an actual nice pen, and it had that big fat nib. And the norris pencil. 

Out of the bunch, I'm pretty much in love with the norris pencil. The really fine tip and the extra length is beautiful when you're drawing. I actually bought extra nibs as soon as I'd used it just to make sure I never run out, lol. The stock pen and the knockoff are functionally identical. Stock feels a little heavier, but they write exactly the same. It's a vast improvement over the teeny slide out note stylus on the 10 and 10.1, but it's not terribly fun to draw with. It will do, but it's way better for handwriting and s pen functions.

The copper tipped stylus is basically my all purpose tool. You gotta charge it, but it lasts like 8 hours. The tip won't wear out from Swype typing, and it doesn't seem to be damaging my screen protector at all. It was 15 bucks, I think. Not great for drawing and painting. No pressure sensitivity or hand rejection. Real nice for games though. Playing through TWEWY with it was great. 

The old bamboo for samsung still works well. It has kind of an annoying level of offset, but you can adjust. I love how that fat nib feels on the screen, so I keep it in rotation.

Are there any other pressure sensitive emr stylus out there? I'd love to add more tips and paperfeel to the arsenal?",samsung,2019-01-11 09:54:00

af09l6,"The Galaxy Watch looks really nice.  For the most part it's a decent watch.  But there's a huge flaw in it's fitness tracking algorithm:  it does not take into account your weight or heart rate when calculating calories burned.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance,  if I weigh 300 pounds and do 30 minutes worth of jumping jacks, I am going to burn way more calories than I would if I weighed 150.  Also, if my heart is beating faster during walking, I will obviously also be burning more calories.  The Galaxy Watch shows the exact same number of calories burned for each exercise, regardless of our individual weight or heart rate - DESPITE THE FACT that I have told the watch how much I weighed, and it's always reading my heart rate.

&amp;#x200B;

This is ridiculous.  I can spend 90% less on other watches that will correctly count calories.  What's sad is even though many people have submitted similar feedback to Samsung, the only response they ever give is that they ""will forward the information to the correct department.""  I am a huge consumer of Samsung products and this is simply lazy, unacceptable, and the information needs to be more widespread so they can address the issue.  It's something that could literally be fixed in a software update.

&amp;#x200B;

When you choose a carrier model, say AT&amp;T you see the carrier -$200 discount. That brings the phone from 999 to 799.

You then elect to trade in a note 8 as well, which is currently valued at $300. Which would then bring the price from 799 to $499. However, when you go to pay in full... the price goes up by $200, 499 to 699.

&amp;#x200B;

What gives samsung? Why show me the discount but not let me do the trade in as well? That's essentially paying me only $100 for the note 8 as opposed to the carrier who gives me $200. Why should I then trade it in instead of selling it via a 3rd party and getting the $200 off from the carrier?

afs3xt,"Hi there

I've got a note 8 for about 3 months. Bought brand new, from local store, the phone is in perfect condition, no scratches, had case from day one. 
Never put it in the same pocket with other items, it always had its own pocket. 

The question is, could the screen crack from sudden temp changes? I was charging it with a wireless charger, which causes it to overheat a little. I went out to buy some groceries, mid winter, -10 to -15 Celsius degrees. Had the phone in my jacket's chest pocket, on the inside. Upon arriving at the store where it was warm and waiting in line to pay, I wanted to check my account balance and noticed the crack http://imgur.com/a/N0C7BE9 . It went from the speaker into 6 different directions. I couldn't have smashed it against anything, as it was right on my chest. Is it possible to get it replaced by Samsung? I've seen some other people complaining about this issue. I went to the local store and they said there is no such thing and it can only be fixed by paying 400$. 

I don't need you to believe me, but I want you to, please try to walk a mile in my shoes. Please give an honest opinion, I cared for my baby since day 0 and I never ever dropped it. ",samsung,2019-01-14 04:31:24

ag3iub,"I am renting a place I live in 60% of the time for work. The landlord is on a long term trip. We email but he's pretty hands off.

The Samsung washer stopped working before Christmas. Landlord had a friend come to check it while I was away and the friend couldn't fix it but luckily it's still under warranty. I returned to the house last week and called Samsung after a few days of back and forth with the landlord. They took all the model/serial info, the address, place and time of purchase, etc. Asked me if I was in front of the machine so I could troubleshoot. I said no but asked if they could ask me the troubleshooting questions so I could confirm if I did them. They refused, gave me a ticket number and asked me to call back.

I call back from the house, give the ticket number and they still make me go through the model/serial number, address, place and time of purchase. The troubleshooting questions are ""is it plugged in"" and ""did you flip the breaker."" I'm like ""well, I don't have a gaping head wound and you could have asked me that off the bat."" Then the guy asks for the receipt. I don't have it, I'm a tenant. He assures me that he can still set up the ticket without it and that I should have talked to him the first time I called because he would have got this sorted out. I have to text a photo of the model and serial number to him and then I should text a photo of the receipt to the same number when I get it--BUT THEY ARE SENDING OUT THE TICKET NOW. I

That was Friday. I called the only service place within 300 km today to check on the ticket status. They didn't have it--we chatted and figured out some strategies to make sure they were able to come out to my area the same days that I am actually out there. I call the appliance store, they send me the receipt PDF and I text it to Samsung. I call Samsung because I don't trust them. I give them the ticket number. They ask me for serial/model and I'm just like like ""I. Already. Did. This. Why. Is. There. A. Ticket. Number. If; You Aren't. Saving. Information."" I tell them I texted the PDF and I want to confirm that the service is scheduled. The guy is like ""oh, no, you need to send this to an email address and then they will schedule the service. I will generate the email address.""

I was polite but clearly not happy. I asked him why the last person told me I could text the photo and asked why they are using three different communication methods to get this serviced. My displeasure resulted in him supposedly creating my ticket and submitting it to the service company while I was on the phone with him. He put me on hold, told me that I didn't need to send the receipt in (BUT I DID) and then said that I'd get a call soon to book the service appointment. I asked if it was the repair company and he said he couldn't say. I'd rather have just emailed the email address and get confirmation in writing that something had been done.

I don't understand Samsung's MO here. Like, if I spend a couple thousand on a washing machine, I'm going to want it fixed under the warranty. They already have my (landlord's) money.

So somewhere in the past year, they halved the points for transactions. I actually completely forgot Platinum level gave 40 points until I just saw it. It's now 5, 10, 15, 20 points depending on your level.

Furthering that, they only allow 50 transactions per month, giving a potential max of 12,000 points per year. Furthering even more.. points expire after a year. You literally can't even bank enough points for the 3 current featured rewards that cost 20,000 points. You can't even get a SmartThings Hub at 14,000 points without buying more points. The biggest feature they removed was being able to buy a Visa Gift Card with your points.

That all being said, is it even worth it now? I literally have to fumble with my phone in order to get it working flawlessly about 50% of the time. I even have to wait a hot second for it to open and start the payment process so there are times I could've just pulled out a credit card and it would've been faster. There are also times where it just won't work 3 times in a row and I ended up using a credit card anyway.  I was literally only using it for the points but they seem worthless at this point.

The cool thing was if I stopped the car and the phone disconnected I could simply pick up where I left off the next time I start driving. It pauses automatically and then continues, very convenient.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to finally write up the oh so pleasant experiences i've had with Samsung support. Due to these experiences (and the fact that their phones always because super slow 6 months in) i can no longer recommend any samsung devices to anybody, and i avoid them whenever possible, even though they have some cool shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

My experiences with Samsung: (loooooooong)

&amp;#x200B;

My galaxy s2 bricks while performing a standard factory reset. Goes to a screen with an error that says its corrupted and to contact samsung. I call samsung and they just keep saying it shouldnt have happened, but not offering a resolution. They refuse to take it or do anything about it, and keep trying to shift the blame to me. Finally they agree to look at it, for a service fee of around $60. I keep pushing, and getting transferred and move to different managers, and after 5 hours of talking/waiting, they agree to fix it for free. I ship it in and wait 4 weeks and get nothing in response. I contact them and they say that after reviewing it (2 weeks ago) they decided its out of warranty, and my options are: A. Pay $120 for service/replacement (needs a new component), or B. Pay $15 for return shipping and handling, and evaluation time. Essentially the phone is being held hostage until i pay them something. I spend another 3 hours arguing with them on the phone, and explaining how they already said they would repair it for free. Finally they agree to repair it. 2 weeks later i get the phone back, and now it boots. Problem is that they damaged the power button while repairing it (or gave me somebody elses device, mine had no scratches, and this one was dinged on the sides). The power button didnt spring back out right, so it was difficult to press, and would periodically trigger itself. Locking and unlocking the device on its own at first, then turning the phone on and off by itself, progressing (over the course of just 4 days) to pressing itself constantly. so now it cant be booted up at all. I contact them again, and this time they just flat out refuse to do anything about it at all, no matter how much i press. Phone was a loss.

&amp;#x200B;

Galaxy note 4 develops ridiculous burnin (through normal use) within 7 months. Screen has so many competing burnin images that none of the colors are showing right. Something very defective. (and the burn-in development went from almost none to a shit load in the period of about a month). I contact samsung and they say that burn-in is just a natural side effect of amoled panels, but doesnt usually develop til around 1.5-2.5 years, so i have nothing to worry about. I keep explaining that i ALREADY have it, and they keep brushing it off saying its normal, but wont happen yet. I tried going to managers and nothing changed. I waited a week and called again, this time using my wifes name (it was her phone anyway) and number to get a clean ticket. Now the tone was not that its normal, but that screen DAMAGE (what they called it) was not covered under warranty, and is only covered under the accidental damage plan. No amount of talking changed this. No repair or replacement was given.

&amp;#x200B;

My wifes 2 week old galaxy s7 edge swells up and cracks while charging on the counter overnight. You could clearly see the the cracks and swollen area (not splitting open swollen, but you could see a different in thickness in that area, increasing towards the center of the cracks). The phone was in pristine condition on the front and sides, and camera area, and it was obvious it had never been dropped. I called and they immediately accused me of dropping the phone and trying to lie to get a replacement, i offered to show them photos of the area (which did show it quite well). They said thats not something that could happen, and that if i dont have accidental coverage, it would be $300 for the repair. I explain that since it happened, the phone battery only lasts about 45 minutes, and if i put it on the charger it heats up and stops charging periodically. They say that this was just a result of me dropping the phone. I start getting too frustrated after 2 hours so i stop for the day. I have my brother call for me the next day (under my name), since he has used samsungs for a while, and he seems to know the necessary tricks to getting appropriate service from him. This time the idea samsung kept pushing was that if the battery swelled up, that means my wife was using a bad/unapproved charger. My wife had recently switched from iphone, and the only charger she owned was the official samsung charger. They kept fighting it, but since their chosen argument was that the battery swelled because of a battery charger, they sort of backed themselves into a corner because they could no longer say that the battery couldnt cause that damaged. They eventually agreed to repair it. I send it in, and 3 weeks later i receive the device as it was. I contact them and they say that the repair was denied, due to there being damage to the back panel (which they claim is an automatic void of warranty, no matter what the issue is). I argue that they already knew the back was broken and thats why i sent it in, they say that that doesnt make sense, as it wouldnt be approved. I eventually convice them to take it back and repair it. 4 weeks later ive heard nothing, i call and they say again that the repair has been denied due to a broken panel. They say i either pay a discounted $150 to get it repaired, or they can ship it back for free (at least no more holding it ransom). I send them text transcripts and recordings from the phone calls, showing the multiple instances in which I stated the glass was broken, and the multiple times they said they understood, and the multiple times they said they would repair anyway. I send the clips in which reps finally admitted this was likely their problem, and a conversation from the last time i talked to them, where they said they promise they will fix it even though it is cracked. They finally just send me a new/refurb one. Combined 12 hours on the phone/chat for this issue.

&amp;#x200B;

The left earbud on my Icon X wireless earbuds stops working correctly (super super low volume). I contact them and they say make me go through over an hour of basic troubleshooting, often repeating the same exact steps. Finally they say they will fix it, but they need an original proof or purchase or receipt. I obviously dont have this (who would? i received it 8 months prior, for christmas, from my wife). And they say that there is absolutely nothing they can do for me unless i have the receipt. I search everywhere i can think of, and ask my wife where she got it, turns out she bought them from a local independent tmobile store, which has since closed and turned into an official Metro PCS store. They cant provide me with a copy of the receipt. I argue for hours that the warranty cant be tied to a receipt, and just because i no longer have that doesnt mean i shouldn't get service. A manager finally agrees, and i get it in writing from him saying ""repair will not be denied do due lack of proof of purchase"". He says that since the serial number i provided them appears to be in warranty, it should be fine after all. I send them in. 5 weeks go by and nothing. I contact them (with an idea of where this is going), and they say that the repair has been approved, but they are backed up. They said to call again in a week. I call again, and they have no info. They cant tell me anything. 3 days later i get an email saying that my repair has been denied, due to failure to include proof of purchase in the box. I call them and get a different dept now, they say that its been denied and that i cant do anything about it now, since they have been waiting for me to respond to this for 3 weeks, and said that they might have been able to approve it without proof of purchase, Had i at any point given them the serial number. I explain that i already provided the serial number in the beginning, and that i have contacted them multiple times. He keeps saying that i am mistaken and that since his records dont show that i contacted them, then its not true. He also says that since his records dont show that i gave them a serial number, then that means i did not, and he keeps repeating that i am just mistaken. I find the transcript of when i sent the serial number and send it to him. he says that there is no way to verify that was from a samsung ticket chat. I give him the chat number and tell him to look it up, and he refuses. Finally he does and he apologizes saying that it looks like i did in fact give them the serial. He then says that he looked it up and it shows that its out of warranty (i know at this point that he is just lying out his ass, and the headphones are 8 months old). I get transfered to management and I explain what happened, they said that no matter what i need a proof of purchase. I show him the time the other manager said that they repair would be approved and the new guy says he doesnt know why the other guy said that, and that it wont be approved. An hour later he agrees to repair it. 7 days later i get the headphones back, still broken, with a paper inside saying they were sent back due to missing proof of purchase. I try contacting them again, and they wouldn't even allow me to open or continue my ticket, as it was marked as repaired and fulfilled.",samsung,2019-01-15 16:18:26

aggae3,"Samsung consistently is at the forefront of all of these smartphone technological breakthrough's but never gets to reap the rewards of being first on the scene because they get beaten. 

I remember samsung talking about bendable phones for literally 5 years. They finally ""are on the verge of releasing one"" (If i had a dollar for every time i heard that...) and now it is officially possible to purchase a phone that folds in half. 

Now I know what you're thinking ""well hey, being the ABSOLUTE first person to do something isn't as important as being the first BIG name company to push it to mass market"" and I agree. If a no-name chinese smartphone beats you its because their standard of quality is way lower. We all remember the shitty in-fingerprint display phones of the last year that used inferior technology and had none of the polish of modern flagship smartphones. 

But its not just small little no-name companies anymore. The oneplus 6t has an in-screen finger print reader. As someone in a computer science program, I always see people with oneplus phones even though most americans had never heard of them. But now that they're available on a major US retailer, they've officially become the first phone with an in-fingerprint display available on a nationwide american carrier. 

And now the hole-punch notch. Just like I said before, I understand that new tech needs more polish on a large phone maker like samsung than some rinky-dink phone company. Which is why samsung wanted to put their infinity-o display on a lower end phone first to get all the kinks worked out. Well now huawei (a major us phone maker) has a phone out with a hole-punch display. 

My point is: is samsung taking TOO long in the R&amp;D phase of their projects?

Samsung has always been a beacon of great hardware in the sea of android phones. Where the pixel is the king of software, samsung has always been the pioneer with hardware. But now... they seem to be lagging behind. 

I know in some regards, ""lagging behind"" is good. 3.5 mm headphone jack and no notch is great. But thats starting to seem less of a power move by samsung and more of a symptom of them just being too slow. ",samsung,2019-01-16 02:10:20
agge2c,"For some reason my tv will randomly turn black for 2-3 seconds but only when I'm gaming on my xbox. Everything else always works perfect. I haven't noticed anything when I watch a 4k BluRay and all the apps work great. Even my Rogers Ignite box works good and the switch as well.
Does anyone else have this problem?
Is there a setting that is causing this?
Any help would be awesome thanks!

aghsf9,"I have a Galaxy book 10.6 and noticed that when I factory reset the tablet, it goes in to portrait mode when it is busy resetting. This is indicative of Samsung having the nonOS controlled default of the device as portrait. So when I install Linux on this device, it runs in portrait mode. Can anyone with a 12 inch Galaxy book or Galaxy tab pro s tell me if their tablet also goes in to portrait mode when performing a reset?",samsung,2019-01-16 05:08:24

agjil0,"Hi there, I recently bought a samsung gear sport and it arrived just today. I've just set everything up and wanted to do a workout on the watch as shown on the samsung website and in various youtube videos etc.On those websites and videos, it says there is a training guide app in which the watch will give you motions to do for a workout. However I cannot find where the training guide app is or how to download it or what it is called. I have searched training guide in the galaxy apps, play store and in the samsung wearables app store and I cant find it. Please help.

Thanks.",samsung,2019-01-16 09:34:34

I have a Note FE (after having the Note 7 taken away) and it's still my favorite. But... I can't use it as my daily phone. The default DPI is 411. For a phone with a screen this size it's stupid. Everything is huge. I like to have it set to 550 to make use of the screen. But upping the DPI breaks everything made by Samsung. Phone app: visual/animation glitches. Camera app: visual/animation glitches. AOD: Crashes when opening AOD settings (fixed in latest version) AOD: Increasing DPI (Making things smaller) makes the AOD BIGGER! Instead of smaller. Samsung Keyboard: Don't get me started. Just use the Google keyboard. So yeah. I find it really frustrating because I LOVE the phone but I literally cannot use it with these issues. I know it's a first world problem but I have a OnePlus and it works much better, but I'd much prefer the Note FE if it worked. I know I could replace the dialer, use a different camera app, disable AOD and use the Google keyboard but I like a lot of these features, especially AOD. And also, for such an expensive phone, Samsung should be developing their applications properly. There's no excuse in 2018 for their software to not be DPI aware. So that's my rant.

It all started in November, I purchased a pretty 50 inch Phillips Ambilight that had terrible banding issues to the point that 4K, HD and SD were unwatchable. I decided to return it to the retailer and bought a 55mu7000 with at first I was overjoyed with. After a few days of usage a friend came round and noticed clumps of dead pixels to the corners of the TV, I had a repairman from Samsung come out who replaced the screen which had even more dead pixels and they didn't even bother to contact me back after promising me they would. Here's where a little silver lining happened. Samsung phoned me after I chased them around ten days later, offering me a 55Q8FAM which I was pleasantly surprised about. I unboxed it, set it up and could not beleive how lucky I was to get this expensive model. After a week however, I was watching the champions league when the dreaded vertical lines started appearing. Samsung proceeded to remote into my television and advised me that everything was fine with the unit, I took their word for it as I thought I may be over careful due to the issues I had before. Three months later the lines got worse, forcing me to contact Samsung support again, to be told there was no issue and they couldn't just replace it as it was past the 28 day period. After a lot of back and forth with their customer relations team I managed to get them to agree to a replacement. Brilliant, I thought. Oh how I was wrong. Please see the attached image to see just how bad my current unit is. Would any of you put up with the state of that and is it as bad as I feel it is? I'm currently in touch with the President however I feel I'm being brushed aside, rather than offer me a replacement as a good will gesture they are offering me a refund of the original price I paid for the MU7000.

Now once it\'s unplugged it will complete the restart. 2) My fast charging have ""quit"" working. I say ""quit"" because if I plug the phone in it will start charging and say fast charging, but a few seconds later it will vibrate again and show the charing annotation but change from fast charging to just regular charging. Yet the estimated time till fully charged will be the same. For both of these I hate treid different cables and charging bricks.

After that, I started getting random disconnects while watching a show, but nothing too bad. These past several months though have been just awful. I will start up a show on Netflix, and about 3 minutes into the episode it disconnects me from my network. I will then attempt to re-connect to the Network, but my 5GHz no longer displays. The solution for this is to either A) turn off the TV for several minutes and turn it back on B) Connect to my 2.4GHz, disconnect from that, then my 5GHz will re-appear. Once I am reconnected to the internet, I get about 3-5 minutes of show time before it cuts out again. This happens with all streaming apps on the television. Why not use my 2.4GHz connection you ask? Well, despite the fact that I can browse YouTube while on the 2.4GHz connection, it acts as if it\'s entirely disconnected from the internet otherwise. Netflix just tells me I am not connected, Prime won\'t load, and Hulu asks me to connect to a network. There is no issue with the Router/Modem or anything else. In the house we have 2 computers, 2 cell phones, a Wii, and my series 1 Amazon Firestick. Using Netflix through the Firestick has absolutely no problems what so ever. I can start up a show, watch 3 episodes, and by morning still be connected to Netflix. The Firestick though cannot handle Plex, and since it\'s a series 1 it takes a good 15-20 minutes to even load up, so it\'s really not a feasible option. Whatever this issue is; has something to do with the television set itself. Samsungs error tries to pin the blame on my ISP by saying ""Problem with your network connection? Contact your ISP!"" The whole ordeal is super frustrating, and I am hoping that someone has some sort of solution to frequent disconnects with their Samsung SmartTV.

I\'m going to be upgrading my phone in a few days (my contract lets me upgrade once a year) and I\'ve landed on either the Galaxy S9, the Galaxy S9 Plus or potentially the Huawei P20 Pro. Right now it is leaning towards the Galaxy S9 Plus the most, as it seems to be packing the most features, a pretty decent battery life, and a great camera. The Huawei P20 Pro definitely gets better battery life which I am aware of, but it lacks quite some features I\'d like to see, which Samsung has. Either way, those of you with either the S9 or the S9 Plus, how would you say your phone manages during an ""average"" day? Battery life is the one thing I\'ve always had issues with on every phone I have owned, except my latest iPhone 8 Plus, but even that one is starting to disappoint me lately. I\'m by no means a super power user, but I do Snapchat quite a lot (which I know takes a lot of battery), but other than that I guess I spend most of my time on Reddit, or just playing around with the phone, nothing too intense. I also listen to music, check social media and stream stuff from time to time. If I have a slow day I\'ll probably do some gaming every now and then. But yeah, the reason why I\'m asking this is that I\'d really like to go back to a smaller form factor for my next phone (so the normal S9 would be perfect), and I would be willing to sacrifice the extra battery life if that ""extra"" isn\'t too much. But between the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus I definitely get a lot more juice out of mine than my friend does with his normal iPhone 8, and we have very similar use-cases.

62,2018-08-08 23:22:05,"[""I'm a video creator and I use the new 1080p 240fps slow motion camera mode a lot in my videos. I recently discovered that my videos were getting a lot of stuttering and lag and even freezing when trying to record. After a lot of digging, and not a lot to go on from the internet, I think I've pinpointed the issue. I purchased my S9+ through T-Mobile about a month ago upgrading from a Google Pixel. I was mostly after the enhanced camera modes such as 4k (60fps), super slow motion (960fps), and 1080p slow motion (240fps). It worked great for the first few weeks and then one day the 240fps mode started recording very choppy, stuttery video and would even freeze or crash on hitting record. At first I thought it was the new SD card I started using, but removing that didn't fix it. Then I tried the usual troubleshooting tactics such as deleting the camera app cache and data. I even went as far as factory resetting the phone. Nothing worked. I finally contacted Tmobile and they sent me a free replacement thinking it was hardware related. Yesterday I picked up my new phone and, voila, it worked. Smooth 240fps video once again. Then last night, my phone auto-updated to latest firmware and once again, I'm stuck with stuttery, laggy 240fps slow motion video. So I had my friend who also has a S9+ through Tmobile test his, and he had the same issue. He is also updated to the latest version of firmware. At this point I knew it was firmware related, so I dug deeper. I contacted Tmobile again and they suggested I contact Samsung. Samsung stated they hadn't heard about this issue and escalated it to their dev team. I'm assuming since the mode isn't enabled on the camera by default that not a lot of people have experienced this issue. Combined with the fact that a lot of people in general don't use slow motion modes. I then had another friend with a S9+ but through AT&amp;T test his and it worked perfectly. After looking at his Baseband version and comparing it to mine, it is the stock version of firmware that ships with the phone and it seems AT&amp;T is further behind on updates than T-Mobile is. TLDR: Don't upgrade to Baseband version G960USQU2ARF7 if you want 240fps camera mode to work smoothly. This is the July 8th update and is the latest update for T-Mobile and hasn't been released for AT&amp;T I'm 99% sure this is the issue and Samsung needs to know about it. If anyone else has a S9 or S9+ through T-Mobile and is updated to the latest firmware feel free to comment and confirm that your 240fps slow motion video is also choppy or stuttering. And if you haven't updated, let me know if your video is smooth or not! I kinda hope I'm wrong and am just unlucky with TWO phones.

However, Samsung\'s rich feature set is what initially got me into the Android ecosystem. I am a tad obsessed with phones. Last year, I bought a S8+ coming from a Nexus 6P. I enjoyed the phone, the battery was fantastic and I liked all the features. I\'ve always loved the Note line, and I toy with buying one each year. However, I gave the S8+ away and got a Pixel XL 2 because of the camera. However, the main difference here is not the back camera. Although, I believe the Pixel\'s camera to be superior, I feel all back cameras from major OEMs (Google, Samsung, Apple), are all highly serviceable. However, what sets the camera discussion a part is the front facing camera. I personally believe that the Front Facing Camera on Samsung devices are downright putrid. I have no idea why they continue to keep the awful face smoothing feature with phones in the west. I gave the S8+ away because the Pixel 2XL front facing portrait mode was insane to see when I was looking at such an awful front facing camera everytime I used it. Now, I am not some self-absorbed individual who needs to take glamour shots. I truly believe the ""selfie"" cam should be viewed as an extension of the camera experience for any phone. It\'s just a way of taking pictures in the today\'s world that is easier sometimes. What I am curious about is have they made any upgrades with the Note 9? I totally buy into the package of creating a truly ultimate phone, which I believe Samsung is very close with here. However, no reviewer or online publication has discussed this.

3,2018-09-01 01:24:56,"['I honestly think Samsung fanboys are worse than Apple fanboys. There main argument that Samsung is better is that Apple copies Samsung, yet, there is an entire 120-some page document that Samsung made to copy Apple’s phones and software. They all hate on Apple even though they have never tried an Apple device saying that Samsung phones are just all around better. Some even say that they bought an iPhone X and the Galaxy s9 or another Samsung phone and said it was better, just to make there point more valid. Yet I have never met or heard of anyone that isn’t a popular tech reviewer who would spend around 2000 dollars to get two flagship phones from different brands just to compare them. Samsung’s newest flagship the Note9 on paper is a beast compared to the iPhone X, but in everyday use and geek bench scores, the iPhone X is faster. The note 9 has 8Gb of ram, compared to the iPhone X’s 3, yet the iPhone, which will be a year old in September, is still faster. That is because of software optimization, which is lacking in android. iOS isn’t open source, meaning that Apple fine tunes iOS to be the best it can. Also, with iOS, you don’t have to wait 7 centuries for you to get the newest update because Apple made sure they control that. Meanwhile, Samsung phones have to wait for the carrier and a whole bunch of other things before you get the newest update. Brands like Oppo and Huawei are getting the update for Android P yet Samsung, the main oem for Android and the brand people think of when they think of android has no phones confirmed to get the update. It’s kinda ridiculous. The S8 is the oldest phone expected to get the update sometime in the next 5 decades, which is kinda sad considering that the S7 exists and came out only 2 years ago. Yet on iOS, the iPhone 5S is still getting iOS 12. That phone came out in 2013. That’s 5 years ago, yet a 2 year old Samsung phone isn’t getting anymore updates. A child can be born and learn how to walk, and learn how to speak a language and be in there second year of school (in the US) in that span of time. I think you get the idea of how long 5 years actually is. There are also rumours that iPhones like the X and others can start getting updates longer because of how powerful and future proof they are. Yet Samsung phones aren’t even getting more than 2 years worth of updates. Every phone has there flaws, and I am not denying that iPhones and Apple themselves don’t have there flaws, but in my opinion I just think that iPhones and Apple in general are just better. I wanted to do this because I haven’t seen very many people say these different points. Yes, there are posts and videos saying that Apple is better than Samsung and blah blah blah, but I haven’t seen very many things on Samsung fanboys or some of the other stuff I just said. I also don’t hate Samsung by any means, they do a lot of great things and make a lot of great innovations. But they have copied Apple ALOT and you can’t deny that. I have definitely gone off topic because this was originally about Samsung Fanboys and not Samsung Phones etc but whatever.

There are times where it works with no issues, but most of the time I miss messages. Either they come in hours late, I've seen from 1-5 or more hours or go missing entirely. Yesterday I looked at my friends phone to realize I missed most texts that day in that group chat. My signal at work isn't great, but I still have 1-3 bars and LTE service. Should be enough to receive texts, and one on one text messaging seems to work flawlessly. I've tried most solutions I've found online including restarting my phone, changing group messaging settings, updating PRL etc. Please help, it's really annoying not being able to participate in conversations with friends.

Chose the ATK headphones for promotional item, and purchased a single fast-charging wireless charger. **8/11-8/21** Watched many YouTube videos and scanned numerous Reddit threads and various other online feeds about the Note 9 in anticipation of receiving mine. Don’t pretend like some of you didn’t do the very same thing. 8/22 Received my beautiful 512 Note 9, lavender purple, unlocked, purchased from Samsung.com. Excited, of course. Already bought two phone cases and the Whitestone Dome screen protector. That\'s how excited. Opened the box, turned on the phone…..the screen had a faint line on the left side running from top to bottom of the phone. My excitement dimmed. Went online to see if anyone else had the issue and/how to fix it, and sure enough someone else said they experienced the same thing and after restarting their phone, the line went away. So, I did the same thing and sure enough, the line went away. Assuming the issue was fixed, I installed my Whitestone screen protector and used Smart Switch to transfer data/info from old phone (that I used for my trade-in). Boxed up my trade-in phone and sent it back using the return label/box. **8/23** Read more online comments about Note 9 screen bleeds and other issues people were having right out of the box, so I called Samsung.com customer service right away in the morning (8:25am), and talked to four different people (Luis, Sasha, Ronna, and Melissa) in just over two hours; I was bounced from one department to another (I was even sent to the warranty department and issued a ticket at one point) and eventually transferred back to customer service. I explained to each of them that I wanted to exchange my phone because it was defective right out of the box and I didn\'t want to take any chances since I spent so much. What I was told (and Samsung records all their calls, so if anyone has access to those, I urge you to listen to them, because their customer service personnel are awful and knowledgeable) that Samsung “doesn’t do” exchanges, they only issue returns. And I would need to return all my items from the order, including the free promotional ATK headphones and the fast wireless charger I purchased. Once I returned it, I could create another order through the website (Samsung.com), and when I received THAT new phone, I would need to call and request a code to order promotional headphones, or whatever promotional item they had available. I explained to Samsung.com customer service that I was unable to send them the phone back because I just sent them my back-up phone for the trade-in, so I would be without a phone until they sent me one; and since the phone I ordered was on backorder, it wouldn’t be until October until they could send me one. Talking to Melissa (10:42am of this call), she suggested that I call FedEx to have them stop the return of my back-up phone, and when I got that one back, go ahead and proceed with my Note 9 return. Frustrated of course, I said I’ll give that a try, and she issued return labels for me to send back my defective Note 9, which are good until 9/7, so that should be enough time to get my phone back and transfer the data/info again and send my new Note 9 back. **8/24 - 8/27** Fedex wasn’t accommodating….at all. Called Samsung.com customer service (8/27 2:12pm) and talked to Diana. After explaining my situation, I’m noticing that these agents are focusing on how I don’t want to send back my promotional item (which I said I didn’t want to because I got it for pre-ordering), and their tone is accusational (not a real word, but I mean it felt like they were accusing me of pre-ordering JUST to get the promotional item and then just keep it or something), but I do my best to explain that ““I’m the customer and I received a product that was defective right out of the box, and I thought just restarting it would fix it, and it seemed to, so I put the most expensive protective screen on it, but it’s a few days later, and the line is back on the screen and even darker than before, and I’m just trying to get a non-defective phone without a bunch of hassle, and nobody seems to understand that I don’t have a back-up phone, and getting one will cost even more money, and you’re trying to make me jump through a bunch of hoops just to fix something that should’ve been as easy as, “No problem, ma’am, we’ll send you a new phone and you just send us back the defective one in the box and return label we provide you”….THAT’S how the initial conversation should’ve gone!”” How the conversation went: I was that person on the phone just rambling my frustrations to a very-new customer service employee who probably just started their shift twelve minutes earlier, and they couldn’t help me nor could they transfer me to their manager because they were on the phone with another customer. I said I’d call back the next day. **8/28** Called Samsung.com customer service after work (4:03pm) and talked to a seemingly-helpful young lady who listened to my situation and said she understood how frustrating it must be, getting a defective phone and now not being able to send it back because I don’t have a back-up phone. She let me vent about how UN-customer-service-like it is to put all the fix-the-situation effort back onto the customer rather than have the vendor apologize for the defective phone and make it right. She said she would escalate my ticket and someone from that department would email me within 24 hours and I could converse directly with them to fix it. **8/30** Called Samsung.com customer service (used my work phone, so I don’t have the actual time, but it was before lunch) to check on the escalated ticket, and the young man said it could take up to 72 hours for an escalated ticket to be responded to. So I wait. **9/6** Called Samsung customer service (11:08am) Talked to a male representative and explained that the return label I have for returning my defective Note 9 expires tomorrow and I still haven’t heard from this “escalated team” from last week, and I’ve been very patient with them, and he responds by saying that he doesn’t see a request for an escalated ticket, so I correct him with the details of the date and time the ticket was requested and he said that his screen doesn’t show that, so I asked to talk to his supervisor. He placed me on hold a bunch of times, each time letting me know that his supervisor is on the phone with another customer. He finally answers and tells me that his supervisor is still on the phone, but he’ll have them call me back within an hour. Before hanging up, I confirmed that he had my correct phone number. Over three hours later, I hadn’t received any calls, so I call “customer service” again (2:28pm). First I spoke to a female representative and explained my urgent situation with the expiring return labels, but she was unable to help me, so I asked to speak with her supervisor and was put on hold several times. She got back on the phone with me every 5 minutes to let me know that she was still there, and I told her that I appreciated her checking back with me. Her supervisor, “Melissa out of the Toronto Canada call center”, finally was on the phone and I again explained the urgency of the situation, and she said she would request an extension to have someone issue new return labels. Since she was a “supervisor” I asked her a bunch of questions about my situation and why I just wasn’t able to get my defective phone replaced, and her rote response was that it wasn’t Samsung’s policy. I wish I would’ve recorded at least this last call because it just floored me with her demeanor. I felt like she didn’t understand why I was so frustrated. I mean, I summarized my experience for her and she didn’t seem to understand what my issue was with just sending back my whole order; she kept responding with, “Samsung doesn’t have an exchange process, they only have a return process.” If I wanted to keep my pre-order promotional item, I would need to use the warranty, which is a different company. I asked her to confirm that the request was made for the return-label extension and then hung up. The next morning, I got an email from their return-label extension dept: *Jennifer B. (Samsung E-Commerce)* *Sep 7, 10:05 EDT* *Good Morning XXXXXXX,* *I am contacting you regarding your Samsung.com order, xxxxxxx. I understand that you are requesting a return label for the defective Note 9 that you had received. Unfortunately, we are unable to issue a new return label at this time being that one had already been sent to you. I have resent this return label to your email address,* [*xx725@gmail.com*](mailto:jxx725@gmail.com) *and the deadline to have this product sent out is today, September 7, 2018 to prevent rejection by the warehouse.* **9/9** So, that’s Samsung.com’s customer service. A combination of “Sorry, not sorry” and “Figure it out for yourself” and “We don’t really know what we’re doing” and “You’re not a customer, you’re just a ticket number with these fragmented notes on my screen that 14 different reps have input over the course of two weeks”.. As a long-time Samsung.com customer (S6, S7, S7 Edge, Note 8, S9+), I guess I can be glad that this is the first and last time I’ll ever have to deal with Samsung.com customer service. All my other phones arrived without defect and the trade-ins went without issue. But this experience has left me with a different perspective of the whole Samsung company and I won’t be buying any more of their products until the frustration wears off. Which really stinks because I had plans to do some serious Christmas gifts this year. Needless to say, I’m going to have to invest in a temporary phone to use and contact the warranty people. Yep, I’m going to use the one-time warranty on a phone that came out of the box defective. Perhaps I’ll get lucky and never need the warranty for anything else. In other news, I found some YouTube videos that demonstrate being reeeeeeally careful to remove the Whitestone screen protector in order to re-apply it…so I might not have to buy another one of those.

I went there, waited for an hour and finally got called up to talk to the staff. I explained my problem and he said it needed a new display, which I knew, so I agreed on the fee of £220 and he started taking information about the phone (serial numbers, model number) A couple of minutes later he came back to me and said that my phone was sold in the United Arab Emirates (I'm from the UK) and that the parts and layout of the phone was different to those of the European Model and they didn't have the parts in stock This was kind of a bummer but what can you do?, he'll order in some parts and I'll come back in a week or two to get it repaired then right? Wrong. He told me that he was unable to get the parts I required and my only option was to either contact Samsung international and hope they do something or go to UAE myself. This is absolutely ridiculous, the fact that I spent a lot of money on this phone, and the fact that I'm willing to spend half of what I payed for the phone for a display is already insane enough, but now they can't even ship over a display for my phone? It doesn't matter where the hell my phone originated from, Samsung is Samsung and it should care about it's customers enough to send me parts for my phone if I require them. It's like going to repair your car. It doesn't matter where the car is from, if the customer needs a part that the mechanic doesn't have, they will order it into their repair centre in order to fix the car. I don't see why Samsung is an exception. I've chosen to spend my money (and a lot of it) on Samsung, not Apple, not Google, they should be there to fulfil my concerns and needs, especially when I'm throwing £220 in their face.

Right now i'm twisted between getting the Iphone X (yes the X not XS/XR/XSM) or the Note 9. Both are going to be the same price from where I get it from (so price isn't an issue for me here) but what will influence my decision will be if the Airpods sound worse on the note 9 because I don't want an unbearable experience. You could say 'Lend just get the IconX then'. No, I can't, i've already bought the airpods which you could call my mistake, but they just seem a lot more comfortable to deal with than the icon X and prettier in my opinion.

I deleted anything I decided I didn't need that was using memory and/or battery and it didn't really help. I'm torn as to what phone I should get next. Here are my thoughts: S9 - Pros: smaller handset but still a bigger screen than I have now (I have smallish hands), lower price (not my primary concern, but it's still a pro); Cons: I'm concerned about going to a smaller battery given my battery life issues with my S7 Edge, lesser features than S9+ or Note 9 (though I'm not sure how much the second rear facing camera, extra RAM, and/or storage would impact me). S9+ - I really like the features, but the size might be unwieldy. I also don't love how oblong this phone is; yeah, the screen is technically bigger, but it's a skinny rectangle so how useful is that, really? Note 9 - it's the best Samsung has to offer, so of course I'm intrigued. The S pen, the only reason to choose this over the S9+, feels a bit gimmicky to me and I'm not sure how much I'd use it.

Takes about 10 or so minutes and I highly recommend doing this: 1. Remove silicon earbud 2. You should see mesh plating. Take a paper clip or something similar and push against an edge of the mesh at an angle. Try not to push directly down as this will push the mesh in rather than sliding it around for removal. 3. Remove the inner piece that you will see. It\'s basically a cloth with glue along the outer ring that allows Samsung to claim water ""resistance"". Picture of this \'cloth\' 4. Place mesh back, be sure to press along the outer ring with a paper clip to ensure mesh is firmly in place. Do this at your discretion as you may risk damaging it with any sweat or dust that can get in more easily now. But this makes your earbuds tolerable again as sound will be even now. Personally, I cut up a piece of paper towel and place it over the mesh on the outside to allow for easy, frequent change while providing adequate protection.

Whenever I disconnect from Bluetooth and pick up LTE standalone it resends me all my SMS and MMS messages I've received since the last time it was unpaired. I was at a conference today and left my Note 9 in another room. As soon as it lost range I immediately got 73 SMS and MMS alerts. All messages that had been received since the night before when I had it unpaired. It happend again later when I walked my dog around the block, only this time it was only the17 messages I had received since this afternoon. 2. Can it not be paired to my IconX? While walking today I was playing music through my IconX. I received an incoming call which I answered on my watch. The callers voice was coming through my watch speaker instead of my headphones, even though my phone showed I was on an active call. That was frustrating. I had to take out my headphones, end the call, and then call them back from my phone. 3. When I am driving its detecting a bicycle exercise, which is probably the funniest of the annoyances. I was going 80mph on the highway and my wrist buzzed. I looked down and it was showing me how many calories I'm currently burning during my ride. It did this both times I drove on the highway.

Even went full Samsung appliances when I renovated the kitchen a couple years ago. Going through the Note 7 debacle sucked though I remained undeterred. Recently noticed puddles of water on the floor below the fridge, which coincided with slushy ice, reduced ice volume &amp; dispense speed, water filling the little catch/evaporation tray below the dispenser and significant amounts of water collecting in the bins inside the door below the ice maker shoot. At first I assumed the door wasn\'t being fully shut though after several mornings of finding fresh water puddles despite confirming both doors were firmly closed each night before going to bed, it was clear something was wrong. Decided to dig around the interwebs. Got as far as typing ""Samsung ice"" when Google suggested ""Samsung ice maker lawsuit"" - Article after article, even Samsung\'s own community site, chronicled exactly what I was experiencing to the letter. Based on what I\'ve read so far, it seems there is no true ""fix"", rather the problem is a fundamental design flaw of the entire ice making and dispensing system, specifically fatal insulation defects ranging from gaps on all sides, inside and out, of the ice maker itself to woefully inadequate gaskets such as the one meant to seal the door and ice shoot when closed, allowing non-freezing temperature air from the fridge to infiltrate the ice box, rendering the device incapable proper operation, leading to melted ice, water leakage, over frosting and a cascade of associated mechanical failures as parts systematically lock up and burn out. Since 2015, at least two service bulletins were issued by Samsung to their service technicians acknowledging the defects and prescribing mandatory ""fixes"", in some cases with special hardware kits, all without notifying customers, allowing ignorance to effectively robbing their consumers of the opportunity to address the defects under warranty, before the defects manifested in actionable malfunctions, which typically begins shortly after the 12 month warranty expires. TBH, I was surprised when my reddit searches about the lawsuit came back empty. Has anyone else heard of or know anything about this?

However, in the past 6 months the phone has gotten slower and slower, to the point where I can't answer calls, and it's driving me crazy. I'm more of a business power user, so I use it primarily for communication and the likes. I only have a handful of apps installed, such as: * Evie launcher (I've also used Apex, Nova, Go, and the default Samsung) * Spotify * Keep * MyMail * OurGroceries * Textra * Amazon * Business calendar * Calendar snooze * Fitbit * Ecobee * Liftmaster (garage door thing) * Lyft * Mint * Starbucks * A file sync tool * My bank I've disabled/removed the games, and unneeded apps like NFL, Slacker Radio, Handcom office, etc. The problem that happens very often is I will be listening to music, or texting, or using Google maps, and someone will call me ... and **the phone will lag so much that the call screen will never appear**. I can hear the phone ringing, but the screen is black. There is no way to see who is calling or answer it. Obviously, this is a bit of a problem if I'm waiting for a work call. I've factory reset the phone at least 6 times, removed nearly all the apps, and it still happens. I even got a new S7 from Verizon (warranty) and it does the same thing! Is it just me? It makes me a little mad that the phone is pretty much useless after just two years. Yeah, it would be nice to upgrade, but I don't feel like shelling out $800 for a new phone to solve a problem that didn't exist a few years ago.

On both devices, experienced the issue wherein if the battery died, the device would no longer accept a charge (I manage a cell phone store, know it's dead). I called Samsung customer service and they had me send in my device for repair - swapped the battery, no biggie. However, this happened 3 more times on my device and 2 more times on my Wife's device in the course of 6 months. I also noticed that a lot of my customers with the S8 and Note 8 series devices were coming in with the same issue. So I knew it wasn't environmental, it was a bad MBR issue (didn't cut off power at 5% like every phone since forever). On the 4th warranty call August 8th, I talked with a rep who stated that just to stop with all the issues that they would be sending me out a new Note 8 instead of simply replacing the battery on the device. I was satisfied with that, and accepted the terms given. However, 3 weeks went by and I didn't receive the replacement. I looked at the tracker, and they had received it almost immediately. So there was no reason for the delay. I called into care again, and was told I would be contacted within 3 business days with a resolution. No call. Instead I was mailed a refurbished Samsung S8. I called care again, explaining the situation, and was told I would receive a call from a supervisor in 48 hours. No call. I called again, asked for a supervisor, and was told I would be contacted by THEIR supervisor in 48 hours. No call. 3 more calls, I'm not making this up. I went as high as the call center COULD go. Waited on the phone for 2:02:14 before I spoke with a person who told me that I would not receive my replacement until they got their S8 back. So they sent me a label via email. I asked the person what kind of device I would be getting back at this point. He told me a refurbished Note 8. This is 10 weeks later. I will never purchase Samsung products again. I will never sell Samsung products to any customer again. I will instruct my team to explain the Samsung Plus experience to their customers to keep them from buying that product.

Granted, it hasn't been that bad lately, but occasionally I get that bug and it iritates the bejesus outta me. Then, although this hasn't bothered me as much, but it still pisses me off, is when I go to read comments or view a certain group/page... The damn top bar becomes useless. I can no longer check my notifications. Instead, it's just a banner with the group/pages post I'm currently viewing. But now, the ultimate frustration of using Facebook on mobile is the CONSTANT page freezing and app crashing when trying to go BACK on a comment thread or post. It happens EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.

33,2018-12-04 14:51:36,"['They released in 2017 and were initially in terrible shape. I\'ve been keeping my eyes on them since then however. They\'ve gotten more firmware updates than any other monitor I\'ve ever seen in my life. The 27"" is currently on 1020.0 I think and the 32"" is on 1019.0 I think. I wouldn\'t get the 32"" version because it uses PWM (pulse width modulation) for some stupid reason which means it\'s not flicker-free. And flickering monitors cause me to get headaches when using them for long periods of time. There were so many issues with these monitors at release that I don\'t even know where to begin to list them. There are a lot of good and in depth reviews of them. The main issue that existed in my opinion was the lack of an adjustable ""overdrive"" setting for increasing the responsiveness of the pixels. This is something called pixel response time. If pixels are slow then there is a lot of blur during movement and high refresh rates become pointless because the pixels can\'t keep up with the high refresh rate and there\'s blur. Basically, every other gaming monitor brand has an adjustable overdrive setting. But the CHG70 didn\'t for some reason. When it launched, it seemed like the overdrive setting they were using was either too low/conservative or there was no overdrive being applied at all. Has this issue been fixed yet? I hope it has been because if this issue is fixed then it makes the CHG70 the overall best FreeSync monitor in the market. Note: In the Settings on the monitor OSD there was a setting called ""Pixel Response Time"" and had three options, Standard, Faster, and Fastest. Which is a very misleading thing to call it because it\'s actually not an ""Overdrive"" setting at all. It controls the backlight strobing. It\'s a black frame insertion feature. Standard is off. Faster is some strobing. And Fastest is a lot of strobing. This is not a replacement for Overdrive because this can\'t be used with 60Hz or FreeSync and it limits the backlight brightness level a lot. I don\'t think it can be used with HDR either.']",0.031,0.914,0.055,0.8888

If you go in there, you will see under each game a ""hardware performance limiter"" option. By default, if this is turned off, the phone will use the known ""recommended"" setting, which is basically throttling the hardware when gaming. For example, for Assassin\'s Creed Rebellion, the recommended hardware limit is at +3, however, you can raise hardware performance for games using this up to +5. Apparently this feature is there to limit performance in exchange for less heat production. However, for really heavy games, this also means you will not see the full potential of the phone and may lead to dropped frames or stuttering unless you lower the game graphics settings. Another feature you can toggle here is the resolution. You like to use your phone on full QHD for videos and pictures, but annoyed at the decreased game performance? You can set games here to use lower resolution. If your base resolution is at QHD, setting it to 50-60% is 1080p, and 25%-30% is 720p for that particular game. Alternatively, capping the FPS to something like 45 instead of 60 may also provide better smoothness if you don\'t want to lower the resolution.

So, I don\'t have much experience in online shopping in general, but I\'d love to buy the perfect gift for my niece who has this [Samsung phone]( It\'s [J2 Pro]( aka ""Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime Pro"" as far as I\'m concerned, and so far everything I saw online is either shady (probably different case will be delivered) or tacky. For instance, [this seems like the perfect case]( to get for her, however, besides the fact that it has just 1 image which looks shopped, it has no reviews, and ANYA\'s (the seller on amazon) other items mostly don\'t have reviews. One that has reviews, for instance, [this one]( it says that different case was delivered and that it was late on top of it all... so I\'m suspicious of ANYA\'s quality of business... Second best would be [this]( but similar thing here, no item reviews, and check out [this out]( somethings off right? I went to ebay too, which is basically diving head first into the unknown for me (never used it in my life, I\'m living outside US btw) [This]( seems like has the choice for Samsung Galaxy J2 Pro 2018 / Grand Prime Pro.... why both as different options? Could someone please let me know what would be the most secure way of getting a cute phone case that will be fit for model I need it to be fit for? I also snooped around on alibaba and found [this]( option, which has [what looks like the right model case for J2]( but no info in written form. Time of delivery is secondary, but still important. I hope someone can help me who has experience in online shopping.

To start; after purchasing we found out that our washer was impacted by the exploding top recall and had to wait 6-9 months for a decision as to what Samsung would do to resolve. They ended up offering to reinforce the top and extend the warranty by a year or replace with a different Samsung dryer (reimbursing the fair market value of the current machine which is total bullshit considering a customer had her jaw smashed open by a faulty washer). Since we did not want a mis-matched pair we opted for the fix. Before they were able to schedule an appointment our dryer stopped working. This was covered under warranty and took 2 service visits, over more than a week, to diagnose and replace the motor. After they repaired the dryer they came to fix the washer and-in truth-I haven’t had issues with it since. However, approximately 1 month after the warranty ended the dryer began squealing like a herd (pack, flock?) or pigs being molested by dirty ole farmer joe. I opted to repair myself to save some cash and had to replace all 4 drum rollers at the cost of $40 and 3 hours of my time. I have now done this procedure 3 times and every time I have to scrub the inside of the machine to removes the rust and rubber shavings that come from the bad rollers. Samsung has/had a reputation for quality but due to my experience I will never buy an appliance from them again. After tearing down this dryer 3 times I can tell you it is just a larger and more cheaply built clone of every dirt-cheap dryer on the market with a slick paint job and stainless steel front panel.

My carrier is Boost Mobile which is on the Sprint network and i bought the phone online through Boost Mobile\'s site since nobody had one in stock locally. My S6 was able to pair to my smart watch just fine but i cant get my S9 to pair. I\'ve tried clearing the network cache, system cache, updated the phone to the latest version and all apps are currently up to date, i even tried turning NFC on for laughs. Of course nothing happened when i did. I was able to get Smart Things to detect and pair to my watch. And in my blue tooth settings i can see it paired. But my watch says its not connected and the watch app on my phone doesn\'t see it connected to the phone. So it seems to me like its ""paired\' but not connected. I think part of the reason why this is happening is Smart Things is changing the MAC address of the phone all the time. Whenever i try to pair through Smart Things, my watch keeps the same MAC address but, according to my watch, the MAC address available to pair to is a different one every time i scan. And every time i try to pair through the watch, i do get an alert on my phone asking if i want to pair to my watch. I don\'t understand why Smart Things is changing the MAC address all the time either, its not helping the situation. I\'ve contacted Samsung support and they recommend doing what i mentioned above, and also doing a factory reset, which i did already when i opened up the box. I normally do one in case it was ever tampered with. I don\'t want to do another factory reset because it took me several hours to set up my phone the way i wanted it and don\'t want to do it again. Worst case I\'ll go to the retailer to get them to look at it. From what i can gather, the Casio watch uses Bluetooth v4.1 and the S9 uses Bluetooth v5. But Bluetooth v5 is supposed to be backwards compatible to work with my watch on v4.1. I\'m also seeing a lot of posts regarding this same issue for a number of different products but none of their solutions, besides pairing through Smart Things, worked. Does anyone have any recommendations/solutions? I really don\'t want to get another smart watch, i just bought this watch 6 months ago and it ain\'t cheap either.']",0.035,0.847,0.11699999999999999,0.983

I'm not terribly worried about that as I'm actively planning to not make any purchases that would even require any checking into of my credit (aside from apartment applications). I did one of those credit karma checks and got a pretty middle of the road score (670). I don't know how that translates into my odds of getting approval, but I'm only applying for like $500 of credit so I'm hoping the relatively low amount will improve my odds of approval. I'm not really worried about being able to make payments because the monthly payment is only like $20 a month anyway. Though I have read some horror stories about TD Bank and their alleged inability to send bills out on time and then we the customer get stuck with a late fee we shouldn't have to pay. So I guess I'm asking this: for those of you who have successfully gotten approval for Samsung financing, was it worth it? What kind of credit score did you have when you got approved? Or even if you didn't apply but know some stuff about credit and whatnot, could you offer your insight?

Probably you are tired of wire clutter behind your monitor. In this case, the SAMSUNG SPACE MONITOR will be the right solution for your clutterless and clean desk future. It's available in a QHD 27-inch model or 4K-resolution 32-inch variant. The bigger, the better! All the cords are hidden into the arm for a clean look. But where did I see this before?! SAMSUNG SPACE MONITOR just somehow reminds me … of Microsoft surface in some way?! Do you agree? What do you think about the SAMSUNG SPACE MONITOR?! Is this a smart solution … or just a stupid design - we don't need?! Do you want to see a longer 360 seconds review … Vote with a simple like or comment.

They did that with the guy's German SIM card and that was supposed to be it. Now I have this problem. I've seen people having the same issue in some forums, but I didn't find any answers. I was wondering if this happened to anyone here, or if anyone here knows the solution. I'm definitely calling the Samsung Germany support tomorrow (that's gonna be interesting, seeing as I don't speak German) since it was the solution I found online, but on the meantime it doesn't hurt to ask on reddit, particularly to people who've bought their samsungs in Europe to take elsewhere, since it seems like a common problem.

Due to these experiences (and the fact that their phones always because super slow 6 months in) i can no longer recommend any samsung devices to anybody, and i avoid them whenever possible, even though they have some cool shit. &amp;#x200B; My experiences with Samsung: (loooooooong) &amp;#x200B; My galaxy s2 bricks while performing a standard factory reset. Goes to a screen with an error that says its corrupted and to contact samsung. I call samsung and they just keep saying it shouldnt have happened, but not offering a resolution. They refuse to take it or do anything about it, and keep trying to shift the blame to me. Finally they agree to look at it, for a service fee of around $60. I keep pushing, and getting transferred and move to different managers, and after 5 hours of talking/waiting, they agree to fix it for free. I ship it in and wait 4 weeks and get nothing in response. I contact them and they say that after reviewing it (2 weeks ago) they decided its out of warranty, and my options are: A. Pay $120 for service/replacement (needs a new component), or B. Pay $15 for return shipping and handling, and evaluation time. Essentially the phone is being held hostage until i pay them something. I spend another 3 hours arguing with them on the phone, and explaining how they already said they would repair it for free. Finally they agree to repair it. 2 weeks later i get the phone back, and now it boots. Problem is that they damaged the power button while repairing it (or gave me somebody elses device, mine had no scratches, and this one was dinged on the sides). The power button didnt spring back out right, so it was difficult to press, and would periodically trigger itself. Locking and unlocking the device on its own at first, then turning the phone on and off by itself, progressing (over the course of just 4 days) to pressing itself constantly. so now it cant be booted up at all. I contact them again, and this time they just flat out refuse to do anything about it at all, no matter how much i press. Phone was a loss. &amp;#x200B; Galaxy note 4 develops ridiculous burnin (through normal use) within 7 months. Screen has so many competing burnin images that none of the colors are showing right. Something very defective. (and the burn-in development went from almost none to a shit load in the period of about a month). I contact samsung and they say that burn-in is just a natural side effect of amoled panels, but doesnt usually develop til around 1.5-2.5 years, so i have nothing to worry about. I keep explaining that i ALREADY have it, and they keep brushing it off saying its normal, but wont happen yet. I tried going to managers and nothing changed. I waited a week and called again, this time using my wifes name (it was her phone anyway) and number to get a clean ticket. Now the tone was not that its normal, but that screen DAMAGE (what they called it) was not covered under warranty, and is only covered under the accidental damage plan. No amount of talking changed this. No repair or replacement was given. &amp;#x200B; My wifes 2 week old galaxy s7 edge swells up and cracks while charging on the counter overnight. You could clearly see the the cracks and swollen area (not splitting open swollen, but you could see a different in thickness in that area, increasing towards the center of the cracks). The phone was in pristine condition on the front and sides, and camera area, and it was obvious it had never been dropped. I called and they immediately accused me of dropping the phone and trying to lie to get a replacement, i offered to show them photos of the area (which did show it quite well). They said thats not something that could happen, and that if i dont have accidental coverage, it would be $300 for the repair. I explain that since it happened, the phone battery only lasts about 45 minutes, and if i put it on the charger it heats up and stops charging periodically. They say that this was just a result of me dropping the phone. I start getting too frustrated after 2 hours so i stop for the day. I have my brother call for me the next day (under my name), since he has used samsungs for a while, and he seems to know the necessary tricks to getting appropriate service from him. This time the idea samsung kept pushing was that if the battery swelled up, that means my wife was using a bad/unapproved charger. My wife had recently switched from iphone, and the only charger she owned was the official samsung charger. They kept fighting it, but since their chosen argument was that the battery swelled because of a battery charger, they sort of backed themselves into a corner because they could no longer say that the battery couldnt cause that damaged. They eventually agreed to repair it. I send it in, and 3 weeks later i receive the device as it was. I contact them and they say that the repair was denied, due to there being damage to the back panel (which they claim is an automatic void of warranty, no matter what the issue is). I argue that they already knew the back was broken and thats why i sent it in, they say that that doesnt make sense, as it wouldnt be approved. I eventually convice them to take it back and repair it. 4 weeks later ive heard nothing, i call and they say again that the repair has been denied due to a broken panel. They say i either pay a discounted $150 to get it repaired, or they can ship it back for free (at least no more holding it ransom). I send them text transcripts and recordings from the phone calls, showing the multiple instances in which I stated the glass was broken, and the multiple times they said they understood, and the multiple times they said they would repair anyway. I send the clips in which reps finally admitted this was likely their problem, and a conversation from the last time i talked to them, where they said they promise they will fix it even though it is cracked. They finally just send me a new/refurb one. Combined 12 hours on the phone/chat for this issue. &amp;#x200B; The left earbud on my Icon X wireless earbuds stops working correctly (super super low volume). I contact them and they say make me go through over an hour of basic troubleshooting, often repeating the same exact steps. Finally they say they will fix it, but they need an original proof or purchase or receipt. I obviously dont have this (who would? i received it 8 months prior, for christmas, from my wife). And they say that there is absolutely nothing they can do for me unless i have the receipt. I search everywhere i can think of, and ask my wife where she got it, turns out she bought them from a local independent tmobile store, which has since closed and turned into an official Metro PCS store. They cant provide me with a copy of the receipt. I argue for hours that the warranty cant be tied to a receipt, and just because i no longer have that doesnt mean i shouldn\'t get service. A manager finally agrees, and i get it in writing from him saying ""repair will not be denied do due lack of proof of purchase"". He says that since the serial number i provided them appears to be in warranty, it should be fine after all. I send them in. 5 weeks go by and nothing. I contact them (with an idea of where this is going), and they say that the repair has been approved, but they are backed up. They said to call again in a week. I call again, and they have no info. They cant tell me anything. 3 days later i get an email saying that my repair has been denied, due to failure to include proof of purchase in the box.

I explain that i already provided the serial number in the beginning, and that i have contacted them multiple times. He keeps saying that i am mistaken and that since his records dont show that i contacted them, then its not true. He also says that since his records dont show that i gave them a serial number, then that means i did not, and he keeps repeating that i am just mistaken. I find the transcript of when i sent the serial number and send it to him. he says that there is no way to verify that was from a samsung ticket chat. I give him the chat number and tell him to look it up, and he refuses. Finally he does and he apologizes saying that it looks like i did in fact give them the serial. He then says that he looked it up and it shows that its out of warranty (i know at this point that he is just lying out his ass, and the headphones are 8 months old). I get transfered to management and I explain what happened, they said that no matter what i need a proof of purchase. I show him the time the other manager said that they repair would be approved and the new guy says he doesnt know why the other guy said that, and that it wont be approved. An hour later he agrees to repair it. 7 days later i get the headphones back, still broken, with a paper inside saying they were sent back due to missing proof of purchase. I try contacting them again, and they wouldn\'t even allow me to open or continue my ticket, as it was marked as repaired and fulfilled.']",0.11800000000000001,0.831,0.051,-0.9991

4,2019-02-01 00:58:50,"['Intro: First things first, when I upgraded from my Note8 to the Note9 I\'ve had issues with the procurement process. I normally go through Best Buy Mobile but this time in order to get a \\~$400 trade in credit I had to go through Samsung directly which tied to my Verizon account. That said, I had a bunch of issues actually getting the websites to talk to each other and had several phone/emails until finally someone found me a workaround (and apparently a lot of people were having issues). Few weeks later I got an email that the trade in credit was declined for the additional amount (\\~$200 difference, if memory serves) and there was nothing they could do about it. So I\'m already feeling ripped off/cheated (I have screenshots and all to prove it, worked those up to management teams who approved and then others ultimately declined). &amp;#x200B; That\'s not even the main part... &amp;#x200B; Yesterday I get a generic email from Samsung Customer Support (same team I was working with on above) about my request being received (which I never submitted??). Today I get phone call (Caller ID: Samsung Electronics Canada Inc.) and a gentleman who starts by explaining the reason for his call which went something like this... &amp;#x200B; ""I\'m not sure if you have noticed, but you haven\'t been getting billed by Verizon lately for your device payments and therefore we haven\'t been receiving those funds"" I go to look at my Verizon bill and he\'s correct, I did not see any device installments for the Note9 on recent bills. I hear people in the call center having the same conversation with other customers which aligns with him telling me... ""This is a known issue we\'re trying to work through with Verizon but the only resolutions are one of two things: 1) Return the device to us and receive a \\~$500 credit or 2) pay us the full remaining balance of $500 and keep the device. So I\'m totally caught off guard at this point. The deal when I signed the contract was a monthly installment that would be paid through Verizon which was initially what was going on. I start explaining how I\'m not surprised this is the case because we knew early on their systems weren\'t communicating with one another. I asked what they\'re doing for customers because this is clearly not an acceptable ask. He said he can offer me the option to keep the freebies (wireless charger and phone case (if I decide to keep the phone)). I begin laughing as does he and he explains he\'s aware of the obvious insanity of that offer but that\'s all they\'re allowed to do. &amp;#x200B; I ask how I would even go about paying if I wanted to and he made it sound like I would call Verizon, pay the total, and they pay Samsung (this makes no sense, because that\'s the challenge they said they\'re having in the first place was getting payment from Verizon). He suggested I call Verizon, confirm the story is legit (and he\'s not a fraud), and then follow through with them. To which I suggested, he have them call me, we figure out how to get installments working again, and we keep on keeping on, otherwise, not my problem. I also mentioned that I\'m not paying anyone other than Verizon because that was not the arrangement. They\'ve already breached the original agreement I made from the get-go and now they\'re asking for in-full payment. I am mind boggled this is happening and also that I couldn\'t find anything online about this from others yet. Question, what would you do? Am I in the wrong if I don\'t call Verizon/Samsung and pay them $500 to even up? Is there any potential this impacts credit scores or anything caused by Samsung? I\'d imagine not because I don\'t have credit or anything setup with them... I feel this is something they should be working with Verizon on. Oh also, I noticed on Verizon\'s website that I\'m eligible for an upgrade which insinuates the device is paid off, so that kind of holds true to his story but also means that as far as Verizon is concerned, I own the device out right...']",0.035,0.88,0.085,0.9902

Each company charges the price you think your product is worth and no one else is forced to buy, correct? Yes, of course. However, since model 6, (today I have a 6S 128GB) I have deeply frustrating problems with the battery. It's just not right to charge my iPhone 2-3 times every day, since I work with it in the streets and constantly need LTE network. It's FRUSTRATING less then ONE HOUR of usage even with more than 90% of battery capacity. The iOS say that my battery is 84% \u200b\u200bhealthy, but I am sure, that is WRONG. That is FAKE! I live in a small town, and different from Samsung and other brands, I do not have an official repair center close to me. I have to travel over 200km to get to the nearest Apple Store (São Paulo) to get repair. That coast a lot, just like my iPhone. Not nice, Apple, not nice ... Reading the news, I see Apple director claiming that iPhones sales were hampered by the batteries replaced by the company's program. That is, they assume that the battery is a factor that forces consumers to buy new phones. Unfair and unethical! I have AirPods, Apple Watch and iPad. Leaving the iOS platform will be quite radical, but I have no choice. Or rather, I have several others. It is not fair to pay the highest value on a new phone and have the WORST battery on the market.

Please note, the setup was working fine until about a week ago, so I am a bit perplexed as to what caused this issue. Typically, I connect the sound bar to the TV via HDMI ARC (on their respective, designated ARC ports). However, when I turn on the TV, the sound bar defaults to ""D.IN"" and does not advance to ""TV ARC"" as it should. My temporary solution was to unplug and re-plug the TV (power reset), at which time the TV will recognize the sound bar via HDMI ARC (and the bar reads ""TV ARC,"" as it should). However, this only works until I power the TV off again. Lately, this no longer seems to temporarily resolve the issue. It simply does not go past ""D.IN"" and no sound emanates from the unit. The sound bar has been updated recently. My TV\'s ""sync settings"" that allow HDMI connected devices to power on with the TV are also all enabled. For some reason, the BRAVIA Sync settings main toggle is grayed out, but appeared to be toggled on. (IIRC, it was not grayed out before this issue starting occurring.) Has anyone encountered anything like this previously? It is frustrating because the entire setup was functioning perfectly well until last weekend.

This, along with the s8 plus Exynos (not sure about the s9 plus as I haven't used it) are some of the absolute worst optimized phones I've ever used. &amp;#x200B; I currently have 2 other high end samsung devices both of which if we ignore loading times COMPLETELY outperform this pile of junk. These devices are an S8 Snapdragon (NOT plus) and Tab S4 Snapdragon tablet. &amp;#x200B; The scrolling in online apps on this phone is downright AWFUL (this also refers to the s8 plus Exynos. If you're wondering what the story with the S8 plus is and why don't have it, I bought it prior to the note cuz I wanted a bigger screen which I returned because I thought it was faulty and bought the note, both brand new. S8 Plus was from amazon, note 9 was from an official local phone store) First and foremost, the scrolling itself is way too fast, sensitive and the acceleration is downright horrible. You barely touch the screen and it goes flying. Second of all, the way content is loaded is absolutely ridiculous. With almost every app that I tested it on, there were always elements whose frames or placeholders DID NOT load up prior to me reaching them when I start scrolling resulting in jitter when they did load up. Both, my tab s4 and my s8 loaded everything's frames and exact place holders with most apps prior to reaching them. So when I start scrolling it resulted in a much smoother experience with minimal jitter Also the note 9 had LOWER fps than both the s8 and tab s4 when loading up certain apps such as twitter and google playstore and scrolling down at medium speed immediately. Some games also loaded slower on the note 9 as well. &amp;#x200B; The apps I tested today were: *\\*\\*\\* The test was simply open the app, quickly go to its most overloaded page and start scrolling down at a slow - medium rate (loading the apps is ignored because the note 9 wins all of them)* **Twitter Trending / Search page** \\- Note 9 - lowest FPS most jitter **Playstore home page** \\- Note 9 - lowest FPS most jitter **Netflix home page** \\- Note 9 lowest fps, S8 most jitter **Google Chrome wwe, paypal, google search and a few others** \\- worst overall performance on the Note 9 **Samsung Browser** \\- best performance on the note 9 (pretty much one of the only things that loads up faster and performs faster) **Prime Video** \\- lowest FPS on tab s4, most jitter on tab s4 **Reddit Trending page** \\- lowest FPS on note 9, most jitter on note 9 &amp;#x200B; I patiently waited for the One UI update just to see if they were going to fix this stupidity but it seems that it never will be. The note 9 and the S8 plus Exynoss have something at their core, whether its their drivers or whatever, it doesn't really matter. Instead of working on a skin for brand new UI, maybe Samsung should actually focus on their hardware and actually test their stuff, not in the way all those clueless phone VS phone youtubers do where they only test the most general stuff - mostly loading times, cameras and battery life. To someone who doesnt own other high end devices this will not be an issue at all or something they notice but to me it is a huge issue. It is not logical or acceptable for a phone that cost me about 50% more than the s8 (when I first bought it) and tab s4 to be performing worse with ANYTHING. It is acceptable for it to be even equal. It should be noticeably faster, smoother etc. with absolutely everything and there is not a single excuse other than absolute laziness, classlessness and lack of knowledge and experience of these so-called developers. &amp;#x200B; I am getting rid of this piece of trash and most likely never purchasing another note or plus phone made by samsung. I'd rather stick with the s8 with the smaller display and no spen rather than wanting to stab myself every time I'm holding my phone. &amp;#x200B; I really don't care what anyone has to say either. This is not bad luck, I've tested other Note 9s, I gave Samsung time and they didn't change a thing. In fact Android Pie I believe has made the phones slower if anything. I really don't give a single F about battery life. Unless you can offer me butter smoother performance I can care less if you're battery lasts a week. And I wouldnt be surprised if this thing Im complaining about is not getting fixed simply to ensure that the plus models and notes get noticeably more battery than the default models.""]",0.09300000000000001,0.882,0.025,-0.9944

Currently I am using 3.0.1.8. 1. ***Will Samsung Notes have a vector engine?*** Currently, there is a raster engine, and therefore you cannot really zoom in anywhere. I was wondering if they have any plans to convert the raster engine into a vector engine. It would also be great to be able to zoom into places. 2. ***Will it ever support Notes Playback?*** One thing that I really like about Notability on the iPad pro is that you have the ability to write down stuff, while at the same time be able to record your voice. This is really quite interesting because essentially, you can record yourself learning something new. Is this in the works, or is there any plan to introduce this in later versions. 3. ***Can I change the background color?*** I'd really love to be able to change the background of the pages in Samsung Notes. Is this going to be ever possible? Is this a part of their backlog? 4. ***Infinite Canvas support?*** I understand that there is a lot of wisdom in having a fixed width page, but it would be nice to be able to create something on an infinite canvas, especially when drawing a mind-map. I am right now using Sketchbook pro to draw things, and then import them into Samsung Notes, but its not the best way to go about things. 5. ***View Notes Online?*** I would really like to be able to share notes with other people who do not have Samsung Notes. This is a real problem for me right now, because I keep having to share PDFs, that get cut in the middle of nowhere.""]",0.033,0.861,0.106,0.9584

On top of the S-View case looking really sleek and allowing me to see the time without having to expose my screen, it comes in that green color that I was after. It's significantly pricier than any other phone case I have used in the past though. I just wanted to know if anyone around here had any experience with the S-View cases and could tell me if they are worth the money on looks, feel, and build quality. I'm not really interested in drop protection promises. I mainly use cases to protect against scratches on the back of my phone.""]",0.034,0.879,0.087,0.7706

I guess I'm here to get some answers about certain things straight from the horse's mouth so to speak. I came here because I could go read tech articles all I want, but I feel more assured if I'm able to talk to actual people and get some personal input before I make any decisions. The main things that are keeping me from just making the switch immediately are as follows: Friends who have purchased Samsung devices after switching from Apple have reported pretty severe slowdown after extended use, and part of the draw of Apple for me is although you can do slightly less with each of its features, you're nearly guaranteed they're all going to work and going to work well. My 7Plus still smoothly rips through any of the things I use on it. How common of a problem is this actually? How common is fairly early slowdown and how is the general smoothness of the OS, apps, and features? Security is also somewhat of a concern for me, and to my understanding Apple is one of the only companies that hasn't been involved in any shading dealing with data and seem to be pretty dedicated to protecting users. Finally, the camera. People like to clown on Android cameras and although I'm aware a lot of it is pretty severe hyperbole, most photos I've seen taken on a Samsung device, even the newer ones, just seem.... off? It's almost like they have their own slight filter that they just bake onto every photo taken. I've always been a fan of the slightly more mild and true to life photos Iphones are able to capture. Overall I'd just like any of you fine folks that have used both to either dispel or help give me more accurate understanding of my concerns. Thanks!""]",0.040999999999999995,0.805,0.154,0.9917

28,2019-03-02 06:49:41,"['(tldr at bottom) &amp;#x200B; Samsung is essentially the only true competitor left in the smartphone market that have retained the headphone jack on their phones. Most of the competition have removed the headphone jack from their phones, but Samsung\'s newly released Galaxy S10 series still keep it, and I am so grateful for that. By now, most people are very aware of companies removing the headphone jack from their phones, and although most people are familiar as to why it\'s a bad idea, I\'d like to reiterate on the main reasons: * The headphone jack is still a feature that **many** people use (and it isn\'t necessarily entitled to headphones). * Bluetooth audio is not as reliable as just sticking in your headphones and listening. (More on this later) Also, dongles are not fun. But my personal problem with removing the headphone jack is slightly different. I personally own a pair of Bluetooth headphones and absolutely adore the comfort in using them for running, and I think it\'s awesome to see the new advancements we make in Bluetooth technology day by day. But I was bothered by the idea that phone manufacturers were taking it away to force us into this new ""wireless future,"" even when they very clearly have space to retain the headphone jack. It\'s lazy and it\'s not innovation of any sort. Again, it\'s awesome that Bluetooth headphones get increasingly better, and I support the new addition of this technology. I also know that to criticize the companies who have already done away with the headphone jack is completely useless; they have moved on. But we still have one company left. **Samsung**. So why am I writing this post then? These days it\'s so normal to see a phone without a headphone jack, and the pressure from other phone companies to join this trend is growing. Hell, I wouldn\'t be surprised if Samsung is facing some serious flack from others for not being ""progressive"" and doing the same. As the release of the Galaxy Note 10 slowly speculates, this is where we need to show gratitude to Samsung for not giving into the pressure to remove the headphone jack, but also give Samsung a helping hand to stay this way. **We like the headphone jack and please keep it.** There\'s so much satisfaction in the small things a headphone jack can do that we take for granted. It\'s awesome that I can use an AUX cord to plug my phone into my friend\'s car to play music. It\'s awesome that I can pull out my tangled earbuds and plug them into listen to music on the subway. And I\'m sure many, many others still appreciate it. So Samsung, thank you for keeping the headphone jack on your new flagships. Please continue to do so. &amp;#x200B; Tl:dr, the headphone jack is still a great feature that people use. Bluetooth technology is great but it\'s still not as reliable.

In almost every video and post I see on the internet someone always at one point or another has to point out that the hole/pill is an issue to them and that ""some people may not like it."" While it\'s true that not everyone will like this design, I feel that the large number of preorder sales alone speak louder than words that people really love this new phone and the design of the front cameras! One of the reasons I love the hole/pill is because I feel that it is much easier for it to disappear into the background while using the phone and even while watching videos and playing games more so than having a large notch take a huge bite out of your screen. Not to mention the hole is oriented in a corner as most mediums do not use those areas as often, effectively making the hole even less intrusive imo. OF COURSE I would prefer for the hole/pill to be much smaller or for the camera to be under the screen, but as it is right now, this is the best we can get and it can only get better from here. I want to hear from you guys though, why do you love the hole/pill? How do you feel it stacks up to the notch/competition?

33,2019-03-02 16:16:47,"[""I wanted to post my experiences with [Samsung.com]( for a while, but now seems like the best time to do so. My fiance and I were able to take advantage of the Note 7 discount when the Note 8 launched. She traded in her S7 Edge, and I traded in my Moto 5G from Amazon. I took multiple videos of both phones showing that everything worked. Things I documented with the video: The phones were able to hold a charge, connect to Wi-Fi, the serial number, powering the phone off and on, and factory reseting the phone multiple times to show that they didn't have any additional locks on the phone. Google Account, PIN number etc. We placed our order on two separate accounts, but both phones were being delivered to the same house. We went on vacation, and both phones arrived shortly after we returned. We sent our trade-in phones, and they were verified by Samsung within a month. No complaints. We also paid outright so we were all set with Samsung. Fast forward to the end of September 2018. My future in-laws were contemplating getting new phones because they wanted to upgrade from their Pixel XL (Verizon). We ordered two T-Mobile Galaxy Note 8's from Samsung because they were the cheapest at the time, and T-Mobile would SIM unlock them without any issue. I messaged T-Mobile via Twitter, and they unlocked the phones without any issue. We later ported out their numbers to Cricket after the phone was unlocked. I also made similar videos prior to send out the devices. We received the phone first on October 2nd. Samsung received our trade-in on 10/09. It took Samsung multiple weeks to verify and validate that trade-in. Samsung won't send out the second phone until they process the first trade-in. After the phone order was complete, we received the second Galaxy Note 8 on Nov 1st. Samsung received our second trade-in on 11/16. I didn't receive an email that our trade in was accepted until January 25th. The trade in process needs to be improved because it shouldn't take Samsung 121 days to complete two orders. Here is some advice. Make sure you read all of the terms and conditions with Samsung. Make sure that you reset your phone multiple times, and take a video of everything. I'm currently 4/4 with trade-ins to [Samsung.com]( but I will never deal with them again. I would recommend trading in your phones locally to your carrier or Best Buy to receive the yes/no for your trade-in on the spot. I'm trading in my Note 8 later today to Best Buy, and it's in near perfect condition. I had a Zagg screen protector installed from the day I bought the phone, and it's consistently been in a case. I'm losing out on my EPP discount and addition $50 accessory credit, but that's a small price to pay to not have to deal with Samsung trade-in. I know Samsung claims that there better with the trade-in procedure now, but I wouldn't risk it. What if you send your phone in, and have to wait for them to send it back? You'd most likely lose trade in value. Samsung makes great phones, but their customer service needs to improve. I hope this sheds some light on the trade-in procedure with Samsung. I've heard some horror stories, but I'm glad more carriers are providing the same trade-in values. I don't really need a new phone, but I would be dumb to turn down $550 for my two year old Note 8.

49,2019-03-03 12:16:51,"['I wish I had known of the horror stories about orders placed with Samsung.com prior to originally pre-ordering an unlocked S10e. I indicated I would trade in my immaculate LG G6 for the allowed $300 credit, and placed my order through Samsung\'s financing department on February 27, at precisely 9:00am. I received an email stating it is received and being processed. At 10:09am I received a follow-up email saying it was being processed and I would be notified as soon as the order shipped. The next day while browsing this subreddit I started to come across stories of issues with Samsung.com\'s terrible practices. Shipping issues, payment issues, financing issues, and trade-in denials on flawless devices. Some of these denied devices even has video evidence of their functionality and lack of damage prior to being sent in! Many of these denials were up to 6 months after receiving the trade-in device. While looking into it further, I came across how terrible TD bank is, the bank that handles Samsung Financing, and also noticed that I have no provided information to log into the account via TD bank and have to wait for however long to even receive the required information to access the account. They only provide you with the last 4 digits of your account AFTER you make a purchase. Speaking of Samsung\'s financing, I didn\'t even receive the email ""welcoming"" me to Samsung Financing until Feb 28 at 3:31pm, 30 hours and 31 minutes AFTER I placed my order (which used their financing to pay...) So sometime that night I cancelled the order via the Samsung website. I expected to receive an email for my records of the cancellation almost immediately like I had when making the purchase but did not. I figured I\'d get one within an hour at least. I receive an email at 4:56 am on March 1 stating a NEW order with an entirely different order number had been received and was being processed. The new order was an exact duplicate of the first one; same phone/color/options/LG G6 trade-in/billing and shipping information/using the same Samsung Financing account number. 4 minutes later at 5:00am another email saying they could not cancel my original order ""because it has already left our shipping facility."" At 5:15 am, yet another email saying they actually WERE able to cancel the original order, the one that just 15 minutes prior had been unable to be cancelled due to being shipped. This is making absolutely no sense by now. At 7:07am another email. The second, duplicate order which I did not place, is being processed and I\'ll receive further information once shipped. All of this has happened whilst I was asleep. I didn\'t even notice these emails until around 6pm, by now I\'m kind of busy with my Friday night family stuff. I go to Samsungs ""Manage my Accounts"" page to cancel the 2nd order in the same way I had the first. There\'s no cancellation option. I open a chat to request a cancel, am sitting there for over 30 minutes without being connected to anyone. I get frustrated and close it out, I\'ve got other stuff to do on Friday evening. On Saturday the wife and I have the kitchen already torn apart for a small remodel we\'ve been working on. We get up and basically work all day painting and removing shelves and cabinets, etc. Head to bed. I wake up today early around 3 am and remember this whole order issue and try again to cancel. No cancel option. I open another chat and this time, after waiting about 10 minutes, finally speak to someone. I explain the situation and they say it\'s been shipped already but that I can just refuse to shipment and it\'ll be returned to Samsung\'s with no charges or fees for doing so, and the entire purchase proceed applied to the financing account with be refunded. I\'m thinking great, problem solved! I thank the representative for their time and head out. A little bit later it occurs to me I haven\'t received a tracking number for my ""shipped"" order which is going to give me no proof of return delivery. I open a new chat explaining I need the tracking number so I can confirm when the package is returned to Samsung. The representative tells me it hasn\'t shipped yet but I\'ll get that information when it does. What the hell??? I told them I was denied cancellation because it had ""shipped"" and all of the previous issues I\'d had such as not even placing the 2nd order. They tell me the order is confirmed ready to ship and essentially awaiting to be picked up by the shipping company. I again tell them this order wasn\'t even placed by me, I have no intentions of accepting it, and it will be returned automatically. I\'m basically told there\'s nothing they can do. So the order I DID NOT place, that I wanted to cancel the day it was generated, a Friday, and not given the option because it had been ""shipped"", will have been sitting there NOT SHIPPED for over 48 hours by the time it\'s picked up by the courier, and I\'m denied cancellation. What the absolute fuck is this.']",0.083,0.8640000000000001,0.053,-0.9829

That happened last week when we reported on [firmware being available for the Galaxy M20 with the March 2019 patch]( ## March 2019 security patch brings bug fixes The security maintenance release for March 2019 includes patches for eight critical vulnerabilities found in the Android OS. That’s in addition to the dozens of high-risk and a single moderate-risk vulnerability patched with this release. The most severe Android OS vulnerability fixed could enable a remote attacker to use a special file to run arbitrary code in the context of a privileged process. However, Google received no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of the reported issues which have now been patched. Also included in this release are patches for 11 Samsung Vulnerabilities and Exposures (SVE) items. Samsung’s vulnerabilities include one which leaked Private Mode thumbnail contents in Gallery and allowed exposure of Secure Folder preview in recent apps. Samsung will now get down to the business of rolling out this security patch to compatible devices. We should expect that to happen over the next couple of weeks.

114,2019-03-06 03:47:48,"[""Background : I haven't touched a Samsung device since the Samsung Blackjack 13 years ago. I was on the Huawei P20 Pro before moving to the S10+. Finally, the following are my opinions and experience... YMMV. &amp;#x200B; Device : Exynos S10 + 128GB Prism White, bought from local telco Singtel &amp;#x200B; Settings : Dark Mode, WQHD+, Reduced Animations, Reduced Animation Time to 0.5x in Developer Settings. &amp;#x200B; Design : Glass sandwich with a almost all screen front. For me, the thing that makes this stand out is the curved display. I know there is some hate for it but this is my first smartphone with a curved display and I love it. Makes the P20 Pro, which is less than a year old, seem ancient. &amp;#x200B; Screen : I read what DisplayMate said about the screen and I concur. Best display I've seen on a smartphone hands down. One of the first settings I change was from the default FHD+ to WQHD+. The display just seems seamless, with the curved display giving the illusion of the screen melting off into the sides. However, the WQHD+ might have affected battery life. More on that later. &amp;#x200B; Fingerprint Scanner (FSP) : The FSP has been a hit or a miss so far but I am getting better at it everytime I unlock my phone. A lot of people have said you dont have to use pressure and you just have to tap. It's more like a prolonged tap and as a YouTuber has shown, tapping and leaving your thumb there takes the exact same time to unlock. It just seems faster for you since your thumb doesn't stay on the screen for long but the time taken to go to your homescreen is the same. The update seems to have helped the FSP too. &amp;#x200B; Software : One of the reasons I didn't use Samsung phones for so long was TouchWiz. I hated what they did to Android. But damn, OneUI is amazing. So amazing that I haven't even changed the default launcher to Nova... yet. Of course the default launcher doesn't have the customizability or the gestures of Nova. It's a simplified version but it's fast and smooth. Gets the job done. OneUI has been smooth in the limited time I have used it, no lags or slowdowns noticed. I have also remapped the Bixby button to Assistant using XDA's excellent tool. Also using AdHell 3 as I cannot stand ads. I am glad you don't need to be rooted to block ads on S10. I know there are non-root tools like Blockada that exist but I just prefer an on-device solution. &amp;#x200B; Camera : Haven't used them much but in the very limited test shots I did, all the cameras produced better than expected pictures. I was expecting average looking pictures, especially since I am coming from the excellent cameras in the P20 Pro. But the S10+ stood its ground. None of the overexposed looking pictures from previous Samsungs. They look... natural. Of course, more samples need to be taken but as first impressions, I am impressed. One thing to note is that the physical aperture mechanism of the main lens seem to be audible. I don't know if that's the case with the S9 as well but its very noticeable on the S10+. &amp;#x200B; Battery : Frankly, the only thing I have been disappointed about the S10+. Bear in mind its only been 24 hours. The device hasn't had the time to learn my habits and use AI to regulate battery yet. But the battery on my S10+ seems to be ticking down really fast, even in normal usage. I am hoping it gets better in a week. Lets see. &amp;#x200B; Others : Haven't tried PowerShare yet so I can't comment. I don't plan on using the Galaxy Buds I got with my purchase as well. One thing that really impressed me was the sound from the speakers. They are loud and with Atmos enabled, they just sound a lot better to my ears. Buttons are all nice and clicky but the power button is positioned really high for some reason. If you have small hands (even for some people with big hands), this might be an issue. But with double tap to wake you might not need to use the Power button as much. &amp;#x200B; Well, that's all I have folks for now. If you are contemplating getting the S10, go get it. You will not regret it. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;""]",0.047,0.831,0.122,0.9966

I recieved it back a week ago, and used it for a little over 4 days when the watch powered off and never turned back on (it was fully charged the night before so it was not a battery issue). Watch was sent back again for repairs, and an email back was sent stating the watch was out of warranty due to water damage, with a repair cost of $600. In the period of 4 days I used it, it was never submerged or rinsed in any kind of liquid. After multiple calls and being on hold collectively for 3-4 hours, I was connected both to the repair center who was quite rude and hung up on me after I explained the issue, and level 2 support who just repeated that water damage is not covered under warranty after I admitted that it may have gotten splashed from washing my hands. All the tier 1 support seem to agree the problem was strange but there's nothing they could do. Now it seems pretty unreasonable that a watch they claim is ATM5 and capable of being submerged to 50M can have it's warranty voided from splashes in the sink, not to mention that the repair cost is almost double of what a brand new watch costs. I can only guess that something happened to it either during the first repair, or the water seals were not installed or incorrect, but at this point it seems like I'm not going to get anywhere with having it repaired or replaced. Their products have always been reliable to me up to this point, have had the first Galaxy phone up till my current Note 9 but this experience is making me do a double take on how they back their products. Anyone else experience a problem like this or is this pretty odd? TL;DR Sent in a Galaxy watch for minor repair, watch dies days after it was sent back claiming water damage with a $600 repair bill despite it's never really gotten wet.

146,2019-03-07 17:59:29,"[""**What is Good Lock?** Good Lock is made up of different modules (applications) used to customize your device developed by Samsung. The lockscreen, navigation bar, status bar, quick panel and more can be completely customized and modified to your liking. But that's not all, it also includes other functions that change the way you use your device, like gestures and the MultiStar app, which provides the multi-window functionality from Samsung Experience that was deleted in OneUI because of Google Policy. **Why the sudden fuss about it?** With OneUI, almost all of the Good Lock modules stopped working properly. Finally Good Lock has been updated providing compatibility with OneUI as well as many new features. **Where can I download?** You can download Good Lock through the Galaxy Store, however it is not available in all regions. If you can't find it you'll have to download and install the APK files manually. I collected all of the Good Lock APKs and can be downloaded conveniently here: **I can't find the apps, where are they?** If you decided to install the apps manually, you won't find all of them in your app drawer. The included Bad Lock application in the above link can be used to launch some of the Good Lock modules, however it was designed to work with the old Good Lock, so it may crash when trying to open some apps and does not contain the full list of modules. To open the Good Lock apps not listed in Bad Lock (MultiStar, NavStar, Nice Catch, etc.) you'll need an activity launcher or an app which can create an activity widget. An easy way to do this would be to download Nova Launcher. Find it on Google Play, you do not need the paid version and you don't have to use it after installing. On your home screen, go to widgets then find and drag and drop the 'Activities' widget. From there, select a Good Lock app and choose the main activity (usually the first one). Then you'll be able to use the app like any other. **Notes:** - To use Good Lock you'll need to have a Samsung device running Android 8.0 or higher. There are a few modules that require Android 8.1 or higher and others Android 9. You can try previous versions of the apps from Good Lock 2018 to see if those work instead. - Sound Assistant is yet to be updated by Samsung. - A new Good Lock module, called 'NotiStar', is planned to be released at the end of the month. - The modules are usually updated monthly. You can download the apps manually from apkmirror.com once they are available. I will also try to keep the provided link updated as possible. - As of writing this post, the new Good Lock is not yet compatible with the Galaxy S10 series.""]",0.039,0.8190000000000001,0.142,0.995

About 3 weeks ago I upgraded TV's and bought a 55inch Smart TV (UN55NU7100FXZA), and everything was great, was streaming UHD on Netflix, everything was playing in 4K smoothly on Youtube, the whole 9. So then I was away from home for about 2 weeks, and then when I come back yesterday... I can hardly stream 1080p without buffering every 30 seconds. Wtf? For context, my internet speeds float at around 150 down/25 up with a single digit ping. This is current, I can get these results on any device in my house in any room on the same connection, and I assumed the Smart TV shared the same results until recently. Right now I can't test higher than 23 down/ 7 up with a ping anywhere from 130-270 on my TV. Yesterday I got on the online support with Samsung and the fella factory restored my TV's settings, checked for all the updates, and changed the DNS to 8.8.8.8, seemed to work for a little while but then today it's the same thing, can't even stream at a shitty 1080p. So it's obviously not my internet considering I can stream the highest possible resolution on any other device in my house, so what gives?! Everything was going good with the TV until just recently and I have no idea what it could be. This is honestly so frustrating taking into account what the TV is supposed to do, my internet connection, and that it wasn't doing this when I bought it. Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions? There's clearly something wrong that neither Samsung support nor I can figure out so I'm really hoping someone does. I'm this close to returning the thing if it honestly can't even stream 1080p.

The customer service during this process has been absolutely atrocious. &amp;#x200B; Here\'s a list of gripes I have about this whole thing. I\'m curious if anyone else picked up on this, and finds this whole thing a bit fishy: \\- It wasn\'t clear that you would need to wait weeks after receiving your phone to even get the eCertificate code. \\-There have been conflicting emails from Samsung, and an overall severe lack of communication about the process from start to finish. \\-Samsung Phone support explained that this was done so the code would be sent right after the return window closed for the phone. I guess I understand this from Samsung\'s perspective, but that should have been well communicated to each customer. \\- Promotional emails that I received prior to purchasing the S10 state that the following regarding the use of the eCertificate: &gt;"" By 4\ufeff/\ufeff4\ufeff/\ufeff1\ufeff9, using your Qualifying Purchase device, follow instructions on the Shop Samsung app (""App"") to submit required info. "" \\-It says in the eCertificate email that it expires 06/27/19. I\'m not sure which email(s) to believe. \\-The galaxy buds have been out of stock for a while with no way to reserve them or put your name down on a list to receive them once they are available again. \\-The support experience is bad at best. The online chat takes 20 minutes to get in contact with anyone, trying to get someone on the phone results in talking to a robot that just keeps repeating itself, and once you get someone on the phone they advise to continuously check the website to know when the galaxy buds become available (This was later clarified by the customer service representative; where she told me that I could add the product to my wishlist) \\-Emails from Samsung recommend using the eCertificate for the Galaxy Buds on the Shop Samsung app, however, the product seems to be completely taken off the app. &amp;#x200B;']",0.04,0.902,0.057999999999999996,0.785

It’s the 2018 model and with the newer model out, I thought I’d be a good opportunity to buy before it goes EOL and they run out. At the time, I was able to buy through the site, sign up for financing and picked my delivery date, which was today, April 5th. Took the day off work to wait for the scheduled delivery and nothing came. Checked the site, still says delivery date: April 5th. Contacted support and only after getting to a supervisor, they told me the TV is backordered. I had to go through support three times, with each tier 1 rep telling me they don’t know and they’d have to forward my email to another team. What pisses me off is that from the time I ordered til now, I was never notified at all. No email telling me there was a change, no notification telling me my shipment will not be coming. Everything pointed to a scheduled delivery date of April 5th. Support told me that they will send my case to their “concern” team, whatever the hell that is. I understand this a 2018 model and it might get sold out. It’s disappointing a company like Samsung’s own e-commerce site lets a customer go through the buy-flow and sign up for financing knowing they don’t have inventory. If I knew it was backordered, I never would have even ordered. I can’t cancel the order because I signed up for Samsung financing. A line of credit that is useless and will be a hit on my credit if I cancel. Has anyone else experienced backorder issues with Samsung.com? How did it get resolved? If I cancel the order, or if Samsung ends up canceling the order, what will happen with the Samsung financing?

The samsung tv has a slider that can adjust the audio if it is out of sync but that doesn't do anything.

I bought the extended warranty with the phone because the sales told me that their new warranty will be able to cover the cost of replacing my screen if I dropped the phone and cracked it and etc. it sounded like a really good deal to me, so I got it. Since the day I got the phone, I realize that there was a really small black half circle on the right side screen, but I always thought it was a problem with the app that I was using or some sort of software issue and didn't bother about it because it was so small. Recently I came across a post and some youtube videos about other users majority of them are note 8 specifically having the same issue and they say it is a hardware issue (defect) of dead pixels and they were able to send it to Samsung to replace or fix it. So I contacted the online support about this, then they told me to contact the service center and then told me to call the service line. but I wanted to be sure so I went into a service center in person to ask about this. Arriving at the service center no one came and ask for help even though it was empty and there were at least five or six people standing around. so I went to the desk and asked what could be the problem and how I can get it fixed and how much it would cost (expected zero or at most $50 due to the warranty). The two people that were at the table had a very disrespectful attitude the entire time. They took the phone and saw the cracks on my screen and said it is a hardware issue but it is not the phone's problem it is because I dropped it. although I explained it has been there since the beginning but they didn't believe me and just kept repeating that it is 100% my problem and they will not be able to fix it for free. So I asked how much will it cost and what it will replace or fix. they said anything that causes the problem will be replaced and it'll cost $130 and then tax, but they cannot fix it today I will have to call and get a service number and then come back. But $130 is a lot of money for this small problem, and I don't think it is worth it since we are just 4 months away from the note 10 release. Now I understand that it is the procedure that in order to get my phone fixed I have to call and get a number and then come back and fix the phone, but it is their attitude that gets me mad. and I just want to know that what does the warranty even cover, if it cannot replace a screen, cannot fix a defect and it charges such a high price for fixing. What was the $200 warranty I paid for even for? And why do salespeople say things that are not true in order to sell the warranty? I like Samsung and I don't think I will switch to any other phones, but I just never had such a bad experience on warranties and bad attitude salesmen. I also don't think I will ever spend money on Samsung's warranty if they are not able to fix anything they promise. (I agree maybe it is my problem that I didn't check online to see what the warranty covers, but it is rare for someone to go buy a phone and on the spot to do research on products such as the warranty) &amp;#x200B; TL;DR Bought warranty, cannot get the problem fixed for free or within the expected range.

So I tried to re-instate that feature on this replacement, only to not be able to rotate the home screen. Yes, apps rotate when flipped to landscape. Yes, I called Verizon technical support, and Verizon even got in contact with Samsung, only to have Verizon tell me that feature was never available for that model phone. The help technician double-checked with me regarding the capability of changing display modes for home screens, app screens, and I confirmed I could do it with the previous phone. She seemed confused. So was I, as I clearly remember being able to flip the phone to landscape in home screen mode. Did I miss something? Is there a feature or setting I'm completely overlooking?

The interface is clean and easy to use and it had made me rethink my thoughts on this idea of 'stock is best'.

I assume this will cover pretty much every case of physical damage to the device such as scratched/cracked screens, broken buttons, broken ports(?). Cracked screens are kind of funny because the official clear view/LED View cases seem to be a cause for a decent amount of cracked screens (phone in case falling, and then on impact the phone falls out of the case). * Water damage... fairly odd, for a waterproof phone. Apart from warranty policy I also recall reading about several cases of Samsung services refusing to honor warranty because the phone had water damage. * Acts of God..... I'm not sure what that means, but I figured I'd include it, just because it gave me the image of Thor coming down from heavens, slapping the phone out of my hands and then smashing it with his hammer (with sparks and lightnings of course). **Partially covered** (contradictory stories from different sources)**:** * Screen burn in. [This samsung community question]( and [this reddit thread]( say it's covered, but comments in the second thread say that Samsung doesn't do these replacements in Poland. [A certain CNET article]( highlights that burn in is only covered **only for normal consumer use** and not business use. Then again this article starts talking about phones and then switches to TVs, so.... take it with a grain of salt. **Covered** (couldn't found contradictory info)**:** * [Battery problems]( (including another thread, linked in this one) says it is covered. Warranty policy does say that overcharging is not covered, but I couldn't find any people that had problems with that.

A few more differences include the Bluetooth S Pen, a better placed finger print sensor, a slightly brighter screen, and the benefits of a longer Android update lifespan. &amp;#x200B; Has anyone lived with both? Is it worth the extra money? Are there significant features that will come with the 9 that I'm not seeing? Is the difference in battery really that noticeable? Thanks in advance. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.""]",0.043,0.83,0.127,0.9657

Almost everything about it, and as someone with a Master\'s in Human Factors, this isn\'t just ""oh it changed, I don\'t like change."" I know and understand interfaces, and the new ""features"" here do nothing at best, and ROB users of functionality at worst. Lets start at the bottom of importance, the appearance. The new icons are blocky, primative, and look terrible on my old background. They make me think of a children\'s toy. The home and back buttons now feel like stickers on the bottom of my screen as well. Related, but more intrusive, is the new recent apps menu (button left of Home on my device). The preview windows again feel like stickers, and you can only see the most recent app without scrolling! In the old layout I could see, click, and reopen several apps back which made multi-tasking or comparing windows so easy! Now if I want to compare more than two things, I have to constantly scroll back and forth, as they change order depending on when I opened them. Yes, the order used to change then too, but with the larger ""buffer"" of seeing several apps back it was a faster and clearer task. The scrolling itself even feels sluggish since you have to move through an entire screen to see one more option. Want a similar example on a function EVERYONE uses, dozens of times a day? How about the new ""Messages"" app screen where, no joke, FIFTY PERCENT of the screen is DEAD SPACE. I KNOW I\'m in messages! I can see them, right there! All my conversations! Or should I say FOUR of my conversations? You know, since that\'s all that fits without scrolling now? SUPER helpful to have LESS information avalible to me, and have it replaced with LITERALLY NOTHING. But this, I am forced to admit, at least still FUNCTIONS... Now we get to one of the worst parts, the change in the settings buttons. Good lord is this a mess...buttons have entirely changed appearences, have been moved to other places in the menu, and some are flat out baffling! Because the Auto-rotate button is automatically grey, displays a lock, and says ""portrait"" it appears to be a button that TURNS ON screen lock. 90% of settings in phones color in when on, and turn grey when off. This is the established model in people\'s heads, and is reinforced even on Samsung phones. This button though changes meaning entirely when clicked, suddely lighting up, becoming an actual ""Auto Rotate"" button, and now indicating that rotate is ON. This one option uses two contradictory models simultaniously! Did a designer even LOOK at it?? Last point for me for now: Where did my Always On Display go!? I LOVED being able to see the time and my notifications simply by glancing down! It was a MAJOR selling point of the phone for me! Now, not only is ALL of that gone, even when I DO wake the phone the time is miniscule in one corner, I can see MAYBE three recent notifaction TYPES...I could read entire messages with one simple click on the old system! I have been touting the merits of Samsung phones up and down for YEARS now...even through the utter debachle that was removing individual text tones...and as a tech-savy person that is also educated in the design of interfaces, I can adapt to most changes very readily...but this is an absoulute travesty! Please, please, PLEASE roll back this interface!!

So I made the switch to android from apple about two years ago with the galaxy note 8 which is a pretty great phone and I really like it but I've had a more than a few issues with it. I was really impressed with the customer care though because they resolved my issues every single time. The major issue I had was with the screen, after about 10 months of buying the Note 8 I began to notice an imprint of the keyboard on my screen, I visited the service centre and they replaced the screen for me and after a few months the new screen began to have the same exact issue so I went back to the service center but by now the warranty had expired and they expected me to pay for a new screen. I called customer care and told them it was not fair for them to expect me to pay for a screen that I have seen fail for me already twice so after some convincing they fixed for me for free and guess what? I'm having the same issue again and I doubt they are going to entertain me again. I hate having to see this imprint on my screen and was in half a mind to buy a oneplus but I noticed videos on youtube talking about a Note 10 coming soon so I decided to hold on a bit more and wait for the Note 10. As per my understanding the note 10 is not going to have a headphone jack which honestly I'm not happy about but I can live without it if samsung provides usbc earphones. I am hearing that there will be no bixby button which I am grateful for! I hope samsung take a cue from oneplus and avoid packing the phone up with useless apps or at least let them be deleteable. I hate having my app drawer stacked with shit I don't use, same as with the iphone, I don't know why they force you to have their apps I mean preload them if you want but after paying a thousand dollars for a phone I expect the freedom to choose what apps I keep on it on remove from it. Yo man people at samsung if you're reading this I gotta tell you I was a click away from buying the oneplus and it is only my positive experience with the samsung customer care and the note 8 in general that has convinced me to wait for a bit. Don't make me go to oneplus or apple because I will if you force me too. Also can we please have something as quick as warp charging on the note 10? That would really help. Think of the kind of person that would buy note, we do a lot of our work on our phones. Battery life is paramount. Everything else can take a hike. Sorry about the rant but those are my thoughts.

I know everyone has had different experiences, so just to give you guys an idea of what someone went through from beginning to end, here’s my experience: TLDR: Not good. They rejected my phone for reasons that were definitely untrue, and I ended up getting my device back and being charged full price for the S10. &amp;#x200B; **May 01, 2019:** Samsung was offering $350 for my LGV30. I was very well aware of the negative reviews their trade-in was getting, but because it was more than double what I could sell it for on eBay, I went through hoping I wouldn’t be one of the unlucky ones. I purchased the Galaxy S10 from their website and received an instant discount for $350 on checkout. &amp;#x200B; **May 02:** Samsung ships the S10. &amp;#x200B; **May 06:** I receive the package. &amp;#x200B; **May 10:** I factory reset my old device, removed SIM and SD card, took photos of it for documentation, packaged it, and dropped it off with the shipping carrier (FedEx). &amp;#x200B; **May 14:** The tracking info shows that they received the package. &amp;#x200B; **May 17:** I receive the first email regarding my trade-in. They rejected it claiming that I didn’t factory reset the phone. They offered me $25 for it. (My phone is also factory unlocked, so it's also not that). I contacted Samsung so I can provide photos that would prove it was reset when I sent it to them. They opened up a ticket and told me it could take 5 business days. &amp;#x200B; **May 18:** I reconsidering fighting the decision after reading how drawn out these could get (some people online claiming it took weeks). I didn’t want to risk it taking weeks only for them to decide arbitrarily that their decision stands and I can either take the $25.00 or forfeit the phone (Samsung only allows you to request a return for the first 7 days from when they make their decision). I requested online that my device be returned. &amp;#x200B; **May 19:** I receive an email saying my request to have my device returned has been accepted and I’ll receive an email with the tracking information once it’s shipped out to me. &amp;#x200B; **May 29**: I receive an email with the tracking number for my trade in-device. I get charged the $350 to my Samsung Financing account. &amp;#x200B; **June 5:** I was having trouble with a FedEx driver who was caught lying about attempting delivery of my package, so I requested to pick it up at a local facility. (a story of it's own). I pick up my trade-in device at the FedEx facility. To my utter disappointment, the phone was locked by whoever was handling it at the facility, but luckily I guessed the passcode on the first attempt - which was simply 0000. The phone has been set-up enough to show you the homescreen. I see an app installed on the phone called mceframework, which I couldn't find any info on.

Even when the Always On Display kicks in after I lock the phone, suddenly this pixel will also come on and just won't budge. It doesn't change color even. I'm not sure what's going on. Thankfully, it's within the return period, but the unit I have is already replacing a first one which exhibited Bluetooth problems.

3,2019-07-01 08:14:56,"['First off, I\'m pretty tech savvy, but I just can\'t seem to fix this problem. At first I had my tv connected via HDMI Arc to my Vizio 5.1 sound bar, and NO MATTER WHAT tv audio setting I had it in, it would constantly cut of audio for a second or so every 1 - 5 minutes.. it was insanely frustrating. It especially would cut off when I had it on Dolby Digital.. the ONLY settings that it would cut off less on was when I had both audio settings on my tv set to PCM, but then the audio was kind of blurry, as in it was harder to really make out what words where being spoken. And yes, I\'ve done ALL the factory resets on the sound bar already. I even purchased a new HDMI cable and the same thing happened. My tv is new also. I then tried my Xbox 360\'s Netflix app, and same thing happened. SO, I switched over to optical and again audio skipping on Dolby digital output on my tv just.. less skipping than on HDMI Arc. SO I bought a new optical cable, and the same thing happened. So, now.. last resort, I switch my audio settings to PCM and PCM and somehow that almost fully worked.. now instead of second long skipping every 1 - 5 minutes, it\'s about one time every hour or so. Better, but no. I want NO skipping, ever. I am not willing to settle, considering the amount I paid for this sound bar. This entire time I was testing it with the built in Samsung Netflix app, which I heard was glitchy with sound bars... so... could THAT be it? After finding that out online, I went to Netflix in my Xbox 360 which is connected via HMDI (not Arc) to my tv, So the Xbox 360\'s audio is now going to my tv, and from my tv to the sound bar via Optical. You know whats been confusing me forever? My Samsung tv has TWO audio settings... almost everybody has just one from what I\'ve seen online.. HDMI Input Audio Format, the options are: PCM and Bitstream and I also have Digital Output Audio Format, the options are: PCM, Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital+ (Which my sound bar doesn\'t accept) DTS (Which never seems to be selectable, it\'s just greyed out), and DTS Neo 2:5 (Which is always selectable, but I hate how it sounds, so I\'ve avoided that one... I haven\'t tried it on optical yet though, just HDMI Arc.) I need to be clearly explained what are the differences and purposes between the HDMI Input Audio Format and the Digital Output Audio Format.. What do they both individually do, and in HDMI Input Audio Format what is the difference between Bitstream and PCM? What do they both do? ....OK so I set the HDMI Input Audio Format to Bitstream and the Digital Output Audio Format to PCM. and the Xbox 360\'s audio settings are: Digital Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby Digital with WMA Pro ...and I set it to Dolby Digital 5.1 and it actually didn\'t skip... BUT after an hour of everything going good, I was watching Avengers Endgame and an anime with the Netflix setting set to English (5.1) and it didn\'t skip for a second.. but the volume instead, lowered itself for a second. Which is why I said it ""dimmed"" in the title.. which is... weird.. and still unacceptable. Again, I want it to work perfectly. But.. I do actually LOVE the way PCM on Digital Output Audio Format sounds via Optical.. It\'s so raw and clear and doesn\'t sound so ""edited"". It feels like I\'m in a theater listening to the sound the way it was intended to be heard.. it even sounds better to me than dolby digital via HMDI Arc, which makes it sound like I\'m listen to the movie through over priced headphones that slightly over ""edit"" the sound slightly instead of leaving the sound the way the sound engineers intended it to be listened to.. but that\'s just my personal opinion from what I hear.. So I love PCM via optical and am hoping I can keep it, (Though, Ill happily use Dolby Digital if I can get it to work perfectly) but at this point? I just want to find SOME setting that will just work and never skip or dim in audio that allows me to get 5.1 surround sound no matter what. 5.1 surround sound is also very important to me considering I payed extra for a sound bar just to get 5.1 instead of a way cheaper 2.0 sound bar.. so I would like to retain those features if possible, while getting the best sound I can. So NOW, I changed the HDMI Input Audio Format to PCM on my tv.. and am going to watch something else again on Netflix as a test with all the settings the same except for that one change.. Both the HDMI Input Audio Format and the Digital Output Audio Format is set to PCM now via Optical, with the Netflix setting set to English (5.1) I\'ll update, to see what happens... This has been about 2 or so months of trial and error, I even replaced the first very same sound bar to see is it was just defective or a dud that I had bought from Walmart online, and the second sound bar that was replaced by Vizio using my warranty WAS skipping way less via HDMI Arc.. but it was still skipping.. which is the sound bar I currently have now. I do think the first sound bar was defective though, this one that I have currently seems to have hope... I. just. need. the. right. audio. settings. I\'m going insane at this point. lol and I\'m going to go even more insane if I have to watch Avengers Infinity War again.. which is the movie I was using to test the sound bars on these last 2 months, because it has the perfect amount of normal volume talking, loud shouting, loud orchestral music, subtle orchestral music, loud explosions, low explosions, subtle sounds, huge battles, normal like every other action movie sounding fight scenes, and basically all the sounds of the average ""movie experience"" all rolled into one movie .. I almost memorized every line.. I\'ve even noticed the CGI mistakes.. the background actors that are smiling when they shouldn\'t be.. the ADR that sounds out of place.. this sound bar has made me sick of Infinity War.. and I used to love that movie. Great. Thanks Vizio sound bar. lol OH and to add upon that I also have an android tv box that I have no idea what settings to set it to. I am thinking about buying an Xbox One X and using an HDMI splitter to send all of my HDMI devices through my Xbox One X and then connect my optical cable to the back of the Xbox One X to send all of my audio to my sound bar.. BUT.. I\'m ify on that, as I don\'t want my Xbox One to be on all day long just because I want to watch a device that\'s connected through it... you know? Also, what audio settings would I need to put on my Xbox One X to make it work perfectly with my sound bar in the future? Just out of curiosity? Oh and my Wii is connected via component cables to the back of my Samsung tv, and it cuts off audio ALOT with optical as well.. about every 1 - 5 minutes, regardless of what audio option I give it.. It only works fine when I convert the wii RCA red and white cables audio to 3.5mm and plug it into the 3.5mm input on my sound bar.. THEN it works and doesn\'t skip... also no my tv doesn\'t have a 3.5 mm output or an RCA output for some dumb reason.. I\'m stuck with and limited to either HDMI Arc or Optical.. and so far optical seems to be the ONLY ONE that is giving me semi hope here. Can someone give me exact settings to set everything to to make this all work? I really don\'t want to have to rely on an Xbox One.. Also can some explain to me what these settings mean? I HAVE google searched them, but the explanations always seem so vague, and usually the tvs they give explanation examples with never have HDMI input Audio Format... JUST Digital Output Audio Format.. which makes things even more confusing to understand what I\'m working with. I have a slight vague idea of everything, but nothing clearly explained to me yet.. I need to know what I\'m working with to find a solution. In all, money is really tight right now, and I\'m hoping that I don\'t have to end up returning this and buying something more expensive in the end.. All help I can get is very much appreciated. Thanks to everyone in advance! and sorry for writing so much, but I really had no choice if I wanted to explain everything clearly.

So 3 days ago I decided to try the built-in screen recording on galaxy s9+ (Built-in screen recording is found in devices that have game tools software, which can be found in the navigation bar when a game or a supported app is currently in use). I set the recording settings to 1080p recording internal sound without using mic. After recording it and watching it, I noticed that the recording is going around 25-30 fps, while the game while it was recording was going on 60 fps. I tried doing it on 760p, and it recorded it at 60 fps with no problems. Meaning that 1080p has an issue and does not record at the amount of fps I was experiencing in the game. So I was wondering if this was indeed a bug on this version of game tools or if it is only my phone that has this issue.. because it seems like samsung doesn\'t know anything else other than ""factory reset your phone"". Please tell me that it is a bug in game tools so I can relief myself and not send my phone for 2 weeks to samsung just for them to say that they fixed it without actually doing anything to it.

After leaving my Galaxy J5 2017 in November of last year to get a Nokia 7 plus and having it stolen around one week ago, I had to come back to that J5 temporarily with plans of getting another phone. I was really impressed with it (and I was ""crying"" over coming back to Samsung a few momths after I got that 7+ anyway), and henceforth I am planning on getting a Samsung phone again, also given that I have the Galaxy Buds and a Gear S3. I settled on the S10 or S10e (my dad has a S10+ taken with a pre-order, which is also the source for my Buds) because of my hefty demands with a phone TL;DR I think the S10e is kinda more suited for me, because of the flat screen and the compact design (I\'ve tested it, not the S10, I\'ll test it in an hour), but I am concerned about the overall performance, the cameras, and that in-display fingerprint sensor of the S10 seems cool These my criteria of selecting a phone: - high performance. I play pubg, not expecting ultra-high graphics, but I want it to run smoothly. Also I am quite a heavy user (lots of Music via Bluetooth and YouTube, also the pubg). I don\'t think it\'s an issue with any of those two...right? - battery life to be good to great. I expect charghing it only during night, but something more than this is obviously welcome - I like the flat screen on the S10e. However, is the curved display that bad on the S10? - I want an ultra-wide camera, but heard the S10e has that too, the telephoto being the one missing? - not that big of a phone. The S10+ is just as big as the 7+ so the normal one should be smaller. I\'ve seen the e, it\'s very compact and I might see it a bit to small, but I kind of think the normal one would be a more balanced option - preferably a dedicated MicroSD slot, but I think none of them has that - stereo speakers (those are a must) - they both come with a plastic screen preotectorz right?

91,2019-08-08 16:55:59,"['**Dear Samsung,** I just wanted to say how disappointed I am in you right now. I\'ve had every Galaxy S phone since the S4 (excluding S5), Note 3, and Note 7 (RIP) . I am currently using the S10 as my main phone. However, with this announcement, I don\'t anticipate buying any more Galaxy phones until you get your act together again. **1.** The headphone jack is one of those quality of life things that you don’t realize you miss until they take it away from you. In all fairness, you did keep it for 3 years after Apple ""courageously"" removed it from the iPhone 7 and Motorola removed it from the original moto Z. We all knew it was coming, since you released mid-range phones and some tablets missing the jack, and the leaks of the Note 10 weren\'t encouraging signs. With this change, you lose one of your differentiating features in the smartphone marketplace (only your compatriot LG seems to make flagship phones with headphone jacks these days). I don’t see why the headphone jack should be reserved for mid-range and low-end phones (i.e. Pixel 3a vs. Pixel 3), it should be included on every phone. Removing the headphone jack is a pointlessly user-hostile feature, especially to the creatives that you are marketing the phone to, who may want to use it with microphones and other accessories. When I\'m in a pinch, I can go to pretty much any store, and I\'ll usually find 3.5mm earphones for as low as $5. I have yet to see USB-C/Lightning earphones/adapters in stores. However, some stores are starting to carry wireless earphones in too, but I haven’t seen them less than $20. I don’t see USB-C or Lightning earphones becoming ubiquitous like that any time soon. I’m not saying that wireless headphones are bad. They’re awfully convenient and can sound decent if you get the right set. But there are still plenty of use cases for the headphone jack. Here’s what I use it for: * When my Bluetooth earphones die/I forget to charge them or when I want virtually *unlimited* battery life. You are trying to resolve the problem with Wireless PowerShare, but not all Bluetooth headphones support wireless charging yet. Even if they did support wireless charging, wouldn\'t it be an awful lot faster to just plug some headphones in? * At my university, there are a lot of Bluetooth devices in close proximity, so sometimes it gets congested and the audio will cut out. A wired connection resolves the problem. * On the last flight I went on, they told us to turn off Bluetooth devices. This means that I couldn’t listen to Bluetooth audio until they announced that you could turn on your Bluetooth devices again. Thankfully my S9+ had a headphone jack, so I could start listening to music right away, rather than listen to the person sitting next to me trying to initiate small-talk. * It might be a placebo, but whenever I use Bluetooth, my headphones sound quieter and less full sounding. When I plug the same headphones into the jack, they sound better and louder. * Bluetooth earbuds (especially truly wireless ones like your Galaxy Buds inside the charging case) are much more bulky than their wired counterparts. It’s so easy to just slip a pair of 3.5 mm earphones into your pocket and use them when I need them. * I mainly use Bluetooth audio in my car when I am by myself. But whenever I have friends or family in my car with me, I’ll use a wire so that we can “pass the AUX jack”. It’s a heck of a lot easier than trying to pair everyone’s phones and switch between them in the settings. **2.** I do like the color choices on the Note 10 line. They are much more visually appealing than your other phones. Other than that, design wise, smartphone aficionados like me can tell them apart, but I showed my mother the Huawei P30 Pro, iPhone XS Max, and Note 10 from the back, she couldn\'t tell much of a difference. I think the S10 range has a more unique design with the horizontal camera layout. I don\'t like the location of the Infinity-O cutout. I liked it better on the S10 line since it was out of the way in the corner. I\'d rather have a Infinity-U display than the current location of the punch-hole. **3.** The Note 10/10+ indicate that you are eschewing your ""kitchen-sink"" philosophy and heading in the footsteps of Apple. In other words, over-charging and under-delivering. The Note 9 was a truly zero compromises, Swiss Army Knife phone. I could name a feature, and it had it. The S10 family was along the same philosophy, although you did remove the Iris Scanner and Notification LED. However, the former was substituted with Face Recognition and the improved Fingerprint Scanner, and the latter can be added via software like the Always on Display, Edge Lighting or third party apps. Yes, the Note 9 may have started at $999, but the comparable iPhone (XS Max) started at $100 more and lacked many features that the Note 9 had (headphone jack, S-Pen, large battery, etc.). It also had half the storage of the Note 9 (64 vs. 128GB) and the screen on the iPhone was way dimmer and way less vivid. I like how you released two sizes of the Note 10 this year, but you should have either decreased the price of the smaller Note 10 and called it Note 10E or gave the smaller Note 10 a 1440p screen and a microSD slot. I think $799 - $849 is a fair price for the smaller Note 10 as it stands, but $949 for a phone with a 1080p screen and no microSD slot is crazy when your competitors\' phones and even your other phones have those features. In other words, if I was going to spend $949 on a new phone, I’d rather get the S10E and save a couple hundred bucks. $1,099 for the Note 10+ is ridiculous when the S10+ costs less and has a dual front camera system, unlike the Note 10 family. Lots of companies make Android phones. To sell yours, you must do things to differentiate your phones. Lower prices, better screens, unique designs, headphone jacks, expandable storage, faster performance, useful software features (not gimmicks), and actually listening to your customers are just some of the things you could do. Instead, you seem to be trying to fit in with the Apple\'s and Huawei\'s of the world. Raising prices and under-delivering will only decrease your profits even further, as fewer and fewer people will be willing to buy your phones, and will look elsewhere. I know I will be. **4.** Aside from the Note 10, releasing the Galaxy Watch Active in March and then releasing its successor a few months later is not cool, Samsung. &amp;#x200B; Sincerely, An Estranged Samsung Fan. &amp;#x200B; **TL;DR:** I am not a fan of removing the headphone jack, the Note 10’s cookie-cutter design, the abandonment of the “kitchen-sink” philosophy, and the release of the Galaxy Watch Active 2 after the Galaxy Watch Active was announced less than a year ago.']",0.04,0.85,0.11,0.9982

I know, I'm an illogical greedy human that wants larger numbers for absolutely no reason. The screen is the only let-down for me. I never used the headphone jack on my Note 9 because I have the Galaxy Buds and even though I have brand new Samsung SD Cards lying around at home, I never actually put them in my Note 9 because the base 256gb storage is more than enough for me. I mean, I guess not being able to get that sexy blue color on Note 10 is sort of a let down because let's be honest, that's one sexy color...

In the past year it got quite slow and even after changing battery it won\'t last me a full day. Also when using Spotify and simultaneously browsing the web it starts burning through my hand. The current and coming iPhones are not an option for me. The price is just ridiculously high for neither getting 5G or USB-C. When spending &gt;1k I plan on using the phone for at least 3-4 years (as with my current iPhone 6). I have had a look on almost every available phone (I think), and my favourites right now are the S10 and Note 10. The OnePlus 7 Pro is simply too big (and expensive, for not having wireless charging and IP certification). The Huawei software implementation seems to be sub-par. The remaining phones are the S10 (128GB, \\~630€) and the Note 10 (256GB, \\~800€). I kind of prefer the Notes design and got a slight bit of hope that the battery life will be a bit better through having the Exynos 9825 instead of 9820. I don\'t really care about the headphone jack as all of my headphones are bluetooth anyway. UFS 3.0 should be an advantage as well. I don\'t really need the stylus, but could see myself using it occasionally (I loved it on my Surface 3). In favor of the S10 is, of course, the lower price (altough lower memory). The display resolution seems to be higher, too, but I read that - at least in default settings - Samsung is downscaling to HD+ anyway. &amp;#x200B; Everything considered, what would you choose?

Ignoring the head phone jack and SD card, as they don't matter for me, the other sticking factor is the screen resolution. Simply being a 1080 screen is not bad. If you put a screen with this resolution into a watch it'll be amazing (and overkill). You need to take into account the clarity of the screen and a good way of doing this is to measure the PPI or pixels per inch. Below is a list of different phones PPI so that you can see how it compares. Note 10 403. Note 10 + 498. Pixel 2 441. Pixel 2 XL 538. S10 550. S10E 438. S10+ 552. Note 9 519. Note 8 514.

One Plus 7 Pro 516. I understand that with the smaller battery Samsung probably went with a 1080 screen to save battery life. I currently have a pixel 2 and this means that my screen quality will get worse. On very rare occasions I look at my screen and feel a little disappointment but I also have a P20 work phone and I think that this screen is fantastic. Likewise we have iPhone 8s in the house and there is nothing wrong with these screens. I've decided that the screen is not an issue for me.

If Samsung wanted to give up the habit of ""2 Android updates only"", and actually not forget their older devices, now is the perfect time to do that. The S7 and S8 are different phones. S7 may not have been suitable for One UI, but we already know that S8 is for Android 10. The hardware can handle it (There are devices with the same hardware as S8 that are getting 10) and the design is almost the same as S9. One UI changed a lot of things, but Android 10 won\'t. I think Samsung should stary giving their flagships 3 updates instead of 2. I mean, the A8 started on Nougat and is getting the update, so I don\'t see the problem. A lotta people don\'t buy Samsung phones because of the software support. -Headphone jack: Well, it\'s a shame that it\'s gone on the Note 10. Kinda weird, since Samsung used to make fun of Apple for it. Well, I think Samsung still has time to go back. Remember the S6 days? They removed a lot of features, for no reason at all. And then, when things turned around, they changed them back with the S7. Samsung still can put the headphone jack on the S11. There are a lot of people who buy S10s instead of Note 10s because of the jack. We\'ll forgive you, Samsung. -Exynos extravaganza: I honestly do not understand why Samsung still makes 2 versions of their phones. Snapdragon definitely performs better in the long run. It\'s kinda weird how some regions have features that others don\'t just because of the chip. Samsung should just make 1 version of their phones, instead of 2. Do you agree?

At least they could lie to me and tell me the color I want is out of stock, but no... Towards the beginning of August 2019, my right Galaxy Bud broke under warranty. This pair was one I purchased from an online retailer and I was able to exchange it to Samsung for free, under warranty for free. Keep in mind this pair was white. Unfortunately, when the new pair arrived two weeks later, it was in the Yellow color. This matters to me as I\'d expect the same product to be returned. I was never made aware of why this color change occurred and the Galaxy Buds were still in stock in white online. This didn\'t make sense to me, so I called customer service back about this. They said it was simply a mistake, so I sent back the yellow pair for a white pair. Unfortunately, two weeks later, I recieved yet another yellow pair. This absolutely made no sense. I called back again the day those arrived and told Customer Service the issue. They said they would escalate this situation. A few days later, I was called by someone higher up in the customer service department who apologized profusely about this and agreed to send me a white pair. They said it would definitely be white this time and said it would arrive in a few business days. This brings us to today, nearly THREE WEEKS later (so much for their ""fastest shipping""), where the earbuds arrive again. Yellow. A third time. After the customer service lady said for the third time they would be WHITE. This all seems kinda crazy to me, so if anyone here has insight into what to do, let me know! I\'m done trying to contact the customer service and promotion lines as they are obviously hot garbage with this issue. I sent this information to the office of the CEO today, so fingers crossed they can help.']",0.055999999999999994,0.882,0.062,0.2139

That’s when we’ll get a good look at One UI 2.0, the next major iteration of its custom skin. The company will likely also detail its plans for Android 10 at the event. As you can probably expect, there will be quite a few new features included in One UI 2.0. We hear that one of those features will be Emoji suggestions and predictions. It will be a fun little addition to the Samsung Keyboard. It will surface these suggestions as you’re typing along. Emoji suggestions will be part of One UI 2.0 This won’t really be a groundbreaking feature. There are countless messaging apps that will show Emoji suggestions and predictions as you type. KakoTalk, a Korean messaging app that’s quite popular across Asia, is one such example. Line is another. Similar functionality has long been offered by third-party keyboards as well. Offering this feature with the native keyboard will ensure that users have fewer reasons to switch away from Samsung Keyboard. We recently got our first look at Android 10 and One UI 2.0 on a Galaxy S10. The video showed a glimpse of the new gesture system that Android 10 brings to the table. Google has made it mandatory for OEMs to bring these stock navigation gestures to their devices. The One UI design itself doesn’t appear to have changed much but since this was likely a very early development build, chances are that things may have changed along the way.']",0.0,0.9540000000000001,0.046,0.7933

Last year I convinced my wife (a long time iPhone user) to try the new Galaxy Note 9 and she had fallen in love with this phone...until. 6 months in the phone had started to have charging issues. we tried flashing it, factory resetting it, cleaning the charge port, switching chargers, buying original Samsung adapters and so on. the phone will only slow charge on anything except a PureGear charger. to top things off her S Pen cracked (which is apparently an issue). We finally just sent the phone in to be looked at and they called and said that the device was not under warranty because it's water damaged...the phone is water resistant!? she hasn't taken it into water, she does wipe her phone down a lot because she has OCD but that is ridiculous to think that cleaning it has caused enough water damage to prevent fast charge from working. So when it came back I took things into my own hands. I have replaced the battery with a high quality Ampsentrix battery, replaced the charge port with an oem charge port and flashed the phone again with a unbranded firmware hoping it was carrier specific and it STILL won't fast charge. today she called because we finally got our receipt for the phone and it was out of warranty so now she can't even get her pen replaced. So last year I bought a phone for $1100 that took water damage from being wiped down, voided warranty on a water damaged phone, got told repair would be $400 and S pen replacement was another $32 so if I want to continue using the phone I'll need to put another $432 into the phone... I can get an iPhone 11 Pro max with a 2 year apple extended warranty that will replace the whole phone for an extra $100 so the phone and warranty would be $1300 and replacement under the warranty would be $100 so $1400 and the phone would be functioning... might be time to switch back to iPhone...""]",0.051,0.9079999999999999,0.040999999999999995,-0.8282

My carrier is Boost Mobile which is on the Sprint network and i bought the phone online through Boost Mobile\'s site since nobody had one in stock locally. My S6 was able to pair to my smart watch just fine but i cant get my S9 to pair. I\'ve tried clearing the network cache, system cache, updated the phone to the latest version and all apps are currently up to date, i even tried turning NFC on for laughs. Of course nothing happened when i did. I was able to get Smart Things to detect and pair to my watch. And in my blue tooth settings i can see it paired. But my watch says its not connected and the watch app on my phone doesn\'t see it connected to the phone. So it seems to me like its ""paired\' but not connected. I think part of the reason why this is happening is Smart Things is changing the MAC address of the phone all the time. Whenever i try to pair through Smart Things, my watch keeps the same MAC address but, according to my watch, the MAC address available to pair to is a different one every time i scan. And every time i try to pair through the watch, i do get an alert on my phone asking if i want to pair to my watch. I don\'t understand why Smart Things is changing the MAC address all the time either, its not helping the situation. I\'ve contacted Samsung support and they recommend doing what i mentioned above, and also doing a factory reset, which i did already when i opened up the box.

Worst case I\'ll go to the retailer to get them to look at it. From what i can gather, the Casio watch uses Bluetooth v4.1 and the S9 uses Bluetooth v5. But Bluetooth v5 is supposed to be backwards compatible to work with my watch on v4.1. I\'m also seeing a lot of posts regarding this same issue for a number of different products but none of their solutions, besides pairing through Smart Things, worked.

I'm not terribly worried about that as I'm actively planning to not make any purchases that would even require any checking into of my credit (aside from apartment applications). I did one of those credit karma checks and got a pretty middle of the road score (670). I don't know how that translates into my odds of getting approval, but I'm only applying for like $500 of credit so I'm hoping the relatively low amount will improve my odds of approval. I'm not really worried about being able to make payments because the monthly payment is only like $20 a month anyway. Though I have read some horror stories about TD Bank and their alleged inability to send bills out on time and then we the customer get stuck with a late fee we shouldn't have to pay. So I guess I'm asking this: for those of you who have successfully gotten approval for Samsung financing, was it worth it? What kind of credit score did you have when you got approved?

Samsung recently announced a cool monitor (Samsung Space Monitor SR75) with a unique design. And because I am a sucker for monitors… and cool design overall … here it is. Supported by an adjustable arm stand, the Samsung Space Monitor gives you extra desk space when you want it, and a close-up view when you need it. The stand clamps to the rear of a desk, letting the screen push all the way back against a wall or tilt and extend forward until it hits the desk surface — or sit anywhere in between. Probably you are tired of wire clutter behind your monitor. In this case, the SAMSUNG SPACE MONITOR will be the right solution for your clutterless and clean desk future. It's available in a QHD 27-inch model or 4K-resolution 32-inch variant. The bigger, the better! All the cords are hidden into the arm for a clean look. But where did I see this before?! SAMSUNG SPACE MONITOR just somehow reminds me … of Microsoft surface in some way?! Do you agree? What do you think about the SAMSUNG SPACE MONITOR?! Is this a smart solution … or just a stupid design - we don't need?! Do you want to see a longer 360 seconds review … Vote with a simple like or comment.

118,2019-01-15 16:18:26,"['After seeing this post [ &amp;#x200B; I decided to finally write up the oh so pleasant experiences i\'ve had with Samsung support. Due to these experiences (and the fact that their phones always because super slow 6 months in) i can no longer recommend any samsung devices to anybody, and i avoid them whenever possible, even though they have some cool shit. &amp;#x200B; My experiences with Samsung: (loooooooong) &amp;#x200B; My galaxy s2 bricks while performing a standard factory reset. Goes to a screen with an error that says its corrupted and to contact samsung. I call samsung and they just keep saying it shouldnt have happened, but not offering a resolution. They refuse to take it or do anything about it, and keep trying to shift the blame to me. Finally they agree to look at it, for a service fee of around $60. I keep pushing, and getting transferred and move to different managers, and after 5 hours of talking/waiting, they agree to fix it for free. I ship it in and wait 4 weeks and get nothing in response. I contact them and they say that after reviewing it (2 weeks ago) they decided its out of warranty, and my options are: A. Pay $120 for service/replacement (needs a new component), or B. Pay $15 for return shipping and handling, and evaluation time. Essentially the phone is being held hostage until i pay them something. I spend another 3 hours arguing with them on the phone, and explaining how they already said they would repair it for free. Finally they agree to repair it. 2 weeks later i get the phone back, and now it boots. Problem is that they damaged the power button while repairing it (or gave me somebody elses device, mine had no scratches, and this one was dinged on the sides). The power button didnt spring back out right, so it was difficult to press, and would periodically trigger itself. Locking and unlocking the device on its own at first, then turning the phone on and off by itself, progressing (over the course of just 4 days) to pressing itself constantly. so now it cant be booted up at all. I contact them again, and this time they just flat out refuse to do anything about it at all, no matter how much i press. Phone was a loss. &amp;#x200B; Galaxy note 4 develops ridiculous burnin (through normal use) within 7 months. Screen has so many competing burnin images that none of the colors are showing right. Something very defective. (and the burn-in development went from almost none to a shit load in the period of about a month). I contact samsung and they say that burn-in is just a natural side effect of amoled panels, but doesnt usually develop til around 1.5-2.5 years, so i have nothing to worry about. I keep explaining that i ALREADY have it, and they keep brushing it off saying its normal, but wont happen yet. I tried going to managers and nothing changed. I waited a week and called again, this time using my wifes name (it was her phone anyway) and number to get a clean ticket. Now the tone was not that its normal, but that screen DAMAGE (what they called it) was not covered under warranty, and is only covered under the accidental damage plan. No amount of talking changed this. No repair or replacement was given. &amp;#x200B; My wifes 2 week old galaxy s7 edge swells up and cracks while charging on the counter overnight. You could clearly see the the cracks and swollen area (not splitting open swollen, but you could see a different in thickness in that area, increasing towards the center of the cracks). The phone was in pristine condition on the front and sides, and camera area, and it was obvious it had never been dropped. I called and they immediately accused me of dropping the phone and trying to lie to get a replacement, i offered to show them photos of the area (which did show it quite well). They said thats not something that could happen, and that if i dont have accidental coverage, it would be $300 for the repair. I explain that since it happened, the phone battery only lasts about 45 minutes, and if i put it on the charger it heats up and stops charging periodically. They say that this was just a result of me dropping the phone. I start getting too frustrated after 2 hours so i stop for the day. I have my brother call for me the next day (under my name), since he has used samsungs for a while, and he seems to know the necessary tricks to getting appropriate service from him. This time the idea samsung kept pushing was that if the battery swelled up, that means my wife was using a bad/unapproved charger. My wife had recently switched from iphone, and the only charger she owned was the official samsung charger. They kept fighting it, but since their chosen argument was that the battery swelled because of a battery charger, they sort of backed themselves into a corner because they could no longer say that the battery couldnt cause that damaged. They eventually agreed to repair it. I send it in, and 3 weeks later i receive the device as it was. I contact them and they say that the repair was denied, due to there being damage to the back panel (which they claim is an automatic void of warranty, no matter what the issue is). I argue that they already knew the back was broken and thats why i sent it in, they say that that doesnt make sense, as it wouldnt be approved. I eventually convice them to take it back and repair it. 4 weeks later ive heard nothing, i call and they say again that the repair has been denied due to a broken panel. They say i either pay a discounted $150 to get it repaired, or they can ship it back for free (at least no more holding it ransom). I send them text transcripts and recordings from the phone calls, showing the multiple instances in which I stated the glass was broken, and the multiple times they said they understood, and the multiple times they said they would repair anyway. I send the clips in which reps finally admitted this was likely their problem, and a conversation from the last time i talked to them, where they said they promise they will fix it even though it is cracked. They finally just send me a new/refurb one. Combined 12 hours on the phone/chat for this issue. &amp;#x200B; The left earbud on my Icon X wireless earbuds stops working correctly (super super low volume). I contact them and they say make me go through over an hour of basic troubleshooting, often repeating the same exact steps. Finally they say they will fix it, but they need an original proof or purchase or receipt. I obviously dont have this (who would? i received it 8 months prior, for christmas, from my wife). And they say that there is absolutely nothing they can do for me unless i have the receipt. I search everywhere i can think of, and ask my wife where she got it, turns out she bought them from a local independent tmobile store, which has since closed and turned into an official Metro PCS store. They cant provide me with a copy of the receipt. I argue for hours that the warranty cant be tied to a receipt, and just because i no longer have that doesnt mean i shouldn\'t get service. A manager finally agrees, and i get it in writing from him saying ""repair will not be denied do due lack of proof of purchase"". He says that since the serial number i provided them appears to be in warranty, it should be fine after all. I send them in. 5 weeks go by and nothing. I contact them (with an idea of where this is going), and they say that the repair has been approved, but they are backed up. They said to call again in a week. I call again, and they have no info. They cant tell me anything. 3 days later i get an email saying that my repair has been denied, due to failure to include proof of purchase in the box. I call them and get a different dept now, they say that its been denied and that i cant do anything about it now, since they have been waiting for me to respond to this for 3 weeks, and said that they might have been able to approve it without proof of purchase, Had i at any point given them the serial number. I explain that i already provided the serial number in the beginning, and that i have contacted them multiple times. He keeps saying that i am mistaken and that since his records dont show that i contacted them, then its not true. He also says that since his records dont show that i gave them a serial number, then that means i did not, and he keeps repeating that i am just mistaken. I find the transcript of when i sent the serial number and send it to him. he says that there is no way to verify that was from a samsung ticket chat. I give him the chat number and tell him to look it up, and he refuses. Finally he does and he apologizes saying that it looks like i did in fact give them the serial. He then says that he looked it up and it shows that its out of warranty (i know at this point that he is just lying out his ass, and the headphones are 8 months old). I get transfered to management and I explain what happened, they said that no matter what i need a proof of purchase. I show him the time the other manager said that they repair would be approved and the new guy says he doesnt know why the other guy said that, and that it wont be approved. An hour later he agrees to repair it. 7 days later i get the headphones back, still broken, with a paper inside saying they were sent back due to missing proof of purchase. I try contacting them again, and they wouldn\'t even allow me to open or continue my ticket, as it was marked as repaired and fulfilled.']",0.118,0.831,0.051,-0.9991

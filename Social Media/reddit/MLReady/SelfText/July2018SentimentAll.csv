I have a Note FE (after having the Note 7 taken away) and it's still my favorite. But... I can't use it as my daily phone. The default DPI is 411. For a phone with a screen this size it's stupid. Everything is huge. I like to have it set to 550 to make use of the screen. But upping the DPI breaks everything made by Samsung. Phone app: visual/animation glitches. Camera app: visual/animation glitches. AOD: Crashes when opening AOD settings (fixed in latest version) AOD: Increasing DPI (Making things smaller) makes the AOD BIGGER! Instead of smaller. Samsung Keyboard: Don't get me started. Just use the Google keyboard. So yeah. I find it really frustrating because I LOVE the phone but I literally cannot use it with these issues. I know it's a first world problem but I have a OnePlus and it works much better, but I'd much prefer the Note FE if it worked. I know I could replace the dialer, use a different camera app, disable AOD and use the Google keyboard but I like a lot of these features, especially AOD. And also, for such an expensive phone, Samsung should be developing their applications properly. There's no excuse in 2018 for their software to not be DPI aware. So that's my rant. Just thought I'd post and see if anyone agrees or maybe have some solutions. I'll probably end up selling the phone though. :( It would be nice if Samsung could see this and push updates to fix the issues but I know it won't happen. :( What do you guys think?""]",0.085,0.793,0.122,0.8922

It all started in November, I purchased a pretty 50 inch Phillips Ambilight that had terrible banding issues to the point that 4K, HD and SD were unwatchable. I decided to return it to the retailer and bought a 55mu7000 with at first I was overjoyed with. After a few days of usage a friend came round and noticed clumps of dead pixels to the corners of the TV, I had a repairman from Samsung come out who replaced the screen which had even more dead pixels and they didn't even bother to contact me back after promising me they would. Here's where a little silver lining happened. Samsung phoned me after I chased them around ten days later, offering me a 55Q8FAM which I was pleasantly surprised about. I unboxed it, set it up and could not beleive how lucky I was to get this expensive model. After a week however, I was watching the champions league when the dreaded vertical lines started appearing. Samsung proceeded to remote into my television and advised me that everything was fine with the unit, I took their word for it as I thought I may be over careful due to the issues I had before. Three months later the lines got worse, forcing me to contact Samsung support again, to be told there was no issue and they couldn't just replace it as it was past the 28 day period. After a lot of back and forth with their customer relations team I managed to get them to agree to a replacement. Brilliant, I thought. Oh how I was wrong. Please see the attached image to see just how bad my current unit is. Would any of you put up with the state of that and is it as bad as I feel it is? I'm currently in touch with the President however I feel I'm being brushed aside, rather than offer me a replacement as a good will gesture they are offering me a refund of the original price I paid for the MU7000.

The phone will black out and vibrate a little. Then couple seconds later it will vibrate again and the logo will appear just for it to keep repeating this process till I unplug the phone. Now once it\'s unplugged it will complete the restart. 2) My fast charging have ""quit"" working. I say ""quit"" because if I plug the phone in it will start charging and say fast charging, but a few seconds later it will vibrate again and show the charing annotation but change from fast charging to just regular charging. Yet the estimated time till fully charged will be the same. For both of these I hate treid different cables and charging bricks. I have multiple Samsung bricks and I either use aukey/Anker cables or Samsung\'s cables. I\'ve also wiped cache partition and the problem still persist. 3.

After that, I started getting random disconnects while watching a show, but nothing too bad. These past several months though have been just awful. I will start up a show on Netflix, and about 3 minutes into the episode it disconnects me from my network. I will then attempt to re-connect to the Network, but my 5GHz no longer displays. The solution for this is to either A) turn off the TV for several minutes and turn it back on B) Connect to my 2.4GHz, disconnect from that, then my 5GHz will re-appear. Once I am reconnected to the internet, I get about 3-5 minutes of show time before it cuts out again. This happens with all streaming apps on the television. Why not use my 2.4GHz connection you ask? Well, despite the fact that I can browse YouTube while on the 2.4GHz connection, it acts as if it\'s entirely disconnected from the internet otherwise. Netflix just tells me I am not connected, Prime won\'t load, and Hulu asks me to connect to a network. There is no issue with the Router/Modem or anything else. In the house we have 2 computers, 2 cell phones, a Wii, and my series 1 Amazon Firestick. Using Netflix through the Firestick has absolutely no problems what so ever. I can start up a show, watch 3 episodes, and by morning still be connected to Netflix. The Firestick though cannot handle Plex, and since it\'s a series 1 it takes a good 15-20 minutes to even load up, so it\'s really not a feasible option. Whatever this issue is; has something to do with the television set itself. Samsungs error tries to pin the blame on my ISP by saying ""Problem with your network connection? Contact your ISP!"" The whole ordeal is super frustrating, and I am hoping that someone has some sort of solution to frequent disconnects with their Samsung SmartTV.

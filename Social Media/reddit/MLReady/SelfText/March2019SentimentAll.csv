I originally wanted to get the Prism Green version, but as we all now know it's not available in the US. On top of the S-View case looking really sleek and allowing me to see the time without having to expose my screen, it comes in that green color that I was after. It's significantly pricier than any other phone case I have used in the past though. I just wanted to know if anyone around here had any experience with the S-View cases and could tell me if they are worth the money on looks, feel, and build quality.

I guess I'm here to get some answers about certain things straight from the horse's mouth so to speak. I came here because I could go read tech articles all I want, but I feel more assured if I'm able to talk to actual people and get some personal input before I make any decisions. The main things that are keeping me from just making the switch immediately are as follows: Friends who have purchased Samsung devices after switching from Apple have reported pretty severe slowdown after extended use, and part of the draw of Apple for me is although you can do slightly less with each of its features, you're nearly guaranteed they're all going to work and going to work well. My 7Plus still smoothly rips through any of the things I use on it. How common of a problem is this actually? How common is fairly early slowdown and how is the general smoothness of the OS, apps, and features? Security is also somewhat of a concern for me, and to my understanding Apple is one of the only companies that hasn't been involved in any shading dealing with data and seem to be pretty dedicated to protecting users. Finally, the camera. People like to clown on Android cameras and although I'm aware a lot of it is pretty severe hyperbole, most photos I've seen taken on a Samsung device, even the newer ones, just seem.... off? It's almost like they have their own slight filter that they just bake onto every photo taken. I've always been a fan of the slightly more mild and true to life photos Iphones are able to capture.

28,2019-03-02 06:49:41,"['(tldr at bottom) &amp;#x200B; Samsung is essentially the only true competitor left in the smartphone market that have retained the headphone jack on their phones. Most of the competition have removed the headphone jack from their phones, but Samsung\'s newly released Galaxy S10 series still keep it, and I am so grateful for that. By now, most people are very aware of companies removing the headphone jack from their phones, and although most people are familiar as to why it\'s a bad idea, I\'d like to reiterate on the main reasons: * The headphone jack is still a feature that **many** people use (and it isn\'t necessarily entitled to headphones). * Bluetooth audio is not as reliable as just sticking in your headphones and listening. (More on this later) Also, dongles are not fun. But my personal problem with removing the headphone jack is slightly different. I personally own a pair of Bluetooth headphones and absolutely adore the comfort in using them for running, and I think it\'s awesome to see the new advancements we make in Bluetooth technology day by day. But I was bothered by the idea that phone manufacturers were taking it away to force us into this new ""wireless future,"" even when they very clearly have space to retain the headphone jack. It\'s lazy and it\'s not innovation of any sort. Again, it\'s awesome that Bluetooth headphones get increasingly better, and I support the new addition of this technology. I also know that to criticize the companies who have already done away with the headphone jack is completely useless; they have moved on. But we still have one company left. **Samsung**. So why am I writing this post then? These days it\'s so normal to see a phone without a headphone jack, and the pressure from other phone companies to join this trend is growing. Hell, I wouldn\'t be surprised if Samsung is facing some serious flack from others for not being ""progressive"" and doing the same. As the release of the Galaxy Note 10 slowly speculates, this is where we need to show gratitude to Samsung for not giving into the pressure to remove the headphone jack, but also give Samsung a helping hand to stay this way. **We like the headphone jack and please keep it.** There\'s so much satisfaction in the small things a headphone jack can do that we take for granted. It\'s awesome that I can use an AUX cord to plug my phone into my friend\'s car to play music. It\'s awesome that I can pull out my tangled earbuds and plug them into listen to music on the subway. And I\'m sure many, many others still appreciate it. So Samsung, thank you for keeping the headphone jack on your new flagships. Please continue to do so. &amp;#x200B; Tl:dr, the headphone jack is still a great feature that people use. Bluetooth technology is great but it\'s still not as reliable. Samsung, you are a blessing for keeping it on your new Galaxy phones and please don\'t give into the pressure around you and remove it in your upcoming releases.']",0.076,0.726,0.198,0.9977

In almost every video and post I see on the internet someone always at one point or another has to point out that the hole/pill is an issue to them and that ""some people may not like it."" While it\'s true that not everyone will like this design, I feel that the large number of preorder sales alone speak louder than words that people really love this new phone and the design of the front cameras! One of the reasons I love the hole/pill is because I feel that it is much easier for it to disappear into the background while using the phone and even while watching videos and playing games more so than having a large notch take a huge bite out of your screen. Not to mention the hole is oriented in a corner as most mediums do not use those areas as often, effectively making the hole even less intrusive imo. OF COURSE I would prefer for the hole/pill to be much smaller or for the camera to be under the screen, but as it is right now, this is the best we can get and it can only get better from here. I want to hear from you guys though, why do you love the hole/pill? How do you feel it stacks up to the notch/competition?

My fiance and I were able to take advantage of the Note 7 discount when the Note 8 launched. She traded in her S7 Edge, and I traded in my Moto 5G from Amazon. I took multiple videos of both phones showing that everything worked. Things I documented with the video: The phones were able to hold a charge, connect to Wi-Fi, the serial number, powering the phone off and on, and factory reseting the phone multiple times to show that they didn't have any additional locks on the phone. Google Account, PIN number etc. We placed our order on two separate accounts, but both phones were being delivered to the same house. We went on vacation, and both phones arrived shortly after we returned. We sent our trade-in phones, and they were verified by Samsung within a month. No complaints. We also paid outright so we were all set with Samsung. Fast forward to the end of September 2018. My future in-laws were contemplating getting new phones because they wanted to upgrade from their Pixel XL (Verizon). We ordered two T-Mobile Galaxy Note 8's from Samsung because they were the cheapest at the time, and T-Mobile would SIM unlock them without any issue. I messaged T-Mobile via Twitter, and they unlocked the phones without any issue. We later ported out their numbers to Cricket after the phone was unlocked. I also made similar videos prior to send out the devices. We received the phone first on October 2nd. Samsung received our trade-in on 10/09. It took Samsung multiple weeks to verify and validate that trade-in. Samsung won't send out the second phone until they process the first trade-in. After the phone order was complete, we received the second Galaxy Note 8 on Nov 1st. Samsung received our second trade-in on 11/16. I didn't receive an email that our trade in was accepted until January 25th. The trade in process needs to be improved because it shouldn't take Samsung 121 days to complete two orders. Here is some advice. Make sure you read all of the terms and conditions with Samsung. Make sure that you reset your phone multiple times, and take a video of everything. I'm currently 4/4 with trade-ins to [Samsung.com]( but I will never deal with them again. I would recommend trading in your phones locally to your carrier or Best Buy to receive the yes/no for your trade-in on the spot. I'm trading in my Note 8 later today to Best Buy, and it's in near perfect condition. I had a Zagg screen protector installed from the day I bought the phone, and it's consistently been in a case. I'm losing out on my EPP discount and addition $50 accessory credit, but that's a small price to pay to not have to deal with Samsung trade-in. I know Samsung claims that there better with the trade-in procedure now, but I wouldn't risk it. What if you send your phone in, and have to wait for them to send it back? You'd most likely lose trade in value. Samsung makes great phones, but their customer service needs to improve. I hope this sheds some light on the trade-in procedure with Samsung. I've heard some horror stories, but I'm glad more carriers are providing the same trade-in values. I don't really need a new phone, but I would be dumb to turn down $550 for my two year old Note 8.

49,2019-03-03 12:16:51,"['I wish I had known of the horror stories about orders placed with Samsung.com prior to originally pre-ordering an unlocked S10e. I indicated I would trade in my immaculate LG G6 for the allowed $300 credit, and placed my order through Samsung\'s financing department on February 27, at precisely 9:00am. I received an email stating it is received and being processed. At 10:09am I received a follow-up email saying it was being processed and I would be notified as soon as the order shipped. The next day while browsing this subreddit I started to come across stories of issues with Samsung.com\'s terrible practices. Shipping issues, payment issues, financing issues, and trade-in denials on flawless devices. Some of these denied devices even has video evidence of their functionality and lack of damage prior to being sent in! Many of these denials were up to 6 months after receiving the trade-in device. While looking into it further, I came across how terrible TD bank is, the bank that handles Samsung Financing, and also noticed that I have no provided information to log into the account via TD bank and have to wait for however long to even receive the required information to access the account. They only provide you with the last 4 digits of your account AFTER you make a purchase. Speaking of Samsung\'s financing, I didn\'t even receive the email ""welcoming"" me to Samsung Financing until Feb 28 at 3:31pm, 30 hours and 31 minutes AFTER I placed my order (which used their financing to pay...) So sometime that night I cancelled the order via the Samsung website. I expected to receive an email for my records of the cancellation almost immediately like I had when making the purchase but did not. I figured I\'d get one within an hour at least. I receive an email at 4:56 am on March 1 stating a NEW order with an entirely different order number had been received and was being processed. The new order was an exact duplicate of the first one; same phone/color/options/LG G6 trade-in/billing and shipping information/using the same Samsung Financing account number. 4 minutes later at 5:00am another email saying they could not cancel my original order ""because it has already left our shipping facility."" At 5:15 am, yet another email saying they actually WERE able to cancel the original order, the one that just 15 minutes prior had been unable to be cancelled due to being shipped. This is making absolutely no sense by now. At 7:07am another email. The second, duplicate order which I did not place, is being processed and I\'ll receive further information once shipped. All of this has happened whilst I was asleep. I didn\'t even notice these emails until around 6pm, by now I\'m kind of busy with my Friday night family stuff. I go to Samsungs ""Manage my Accounts"" page to cancel the 2nd order in the same way I had the first. There\'s no cancellation option. I open a chat to request a cancel, am sitting there for over 30 minutes without being connected to anyone. I get frustrated and close it out, I\'ve got other stuff to do on Friday evening. On Saturday the wife and I have the kitchen already torn apart for a small remodel we\'ve been working on. We get up and basically work all day painting and removing shelves and cabinets, etc. Head to bed. I wake up today early around 3 am and remember this whole order issue and try again to cancel. No cancel option. I open another chat and this time, after waiting about 10 minutes, finally speak to someone. I explain the situation and they say it\'s been shipped already but that I can just refuse to shipment and it\'ll be returned to Samsung\'s with no charges or fees for doing so, and the entire purchase proceed applied to the financing account with be refunded. I\'m thinking great, problem solved! I thank the representative for their time and head out. A little bit later it occurs to me I haven\'t received a tracking number for my ""shipped"" order which is going to give me no proof of return delivery. I open a new chat explaining I need the tracking number so I can confirm when the package is returned to Samsung. The representative tells me it hasn\'t shipped yet but I\'ll get that information when it does. What the hell??? I told them I was denied cancellation because it had ""shipped"" and all of the previous issues I\'d had such as not even placing the 2nd order. They tell me the order is confirmed ready to ship and essentially awaiting to be picked up by the shipping company. I again tell them this order wasn\'t even placed by me, I have no intentions of accepting it, and it will be returned automatically. I\'m basically told there\'s nothing they can do. So the order I DID NOT place, that I wanted to cancel the day it was generated, a Friday, and not given the option because it had been ""shipped"", will have been sitting there NOT SHIPPED for over 48 hours by the time it\'s picked up by the courier, and I\'m denied cancellation. What the absolute fuck is this.']",0.083,0.864,0.053,-0.9829

The latest security maintenance release should start making its way to compatible devices in the coming days. As expected, it brings bug fixes from both Google and Samsung. We have seen in recent months that one or two devices actually get the new patch even before it’s detailed by Samsung. That happened last week when we reported on [firmware being available for the Galaxy M20 with the March 2019 patch]( ## March 2019 security patch brings bug fixes The security maintenance release for March 2019 includes patches for eight critical vulnerabilities found in the Android OS. That’s in addition to the dozens of high-risk and a single moderate-risk vulnerability patched with this release. The most severe Android OS vulnerability fixed could enable a remote attacker to use a special file to run arbitrary code in the context of a privileged process. However, Google received no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of the reported issues which have now been patched. Also included in this release are patches for 11 Samsung Vulnerabilities and Exposures (SVE) items. Samsung’s vulnerabilities include one which leaked Private Mode thumbnail contents in Gallery and allowed exposure of Secure Folder preview in recent apps. Samsung will now get down to the business of rolling out this security patch to compatible devices. We should expect that to happen over the next couple of weeks.

114,2019-03-06 03:47:48,"[""Background : I haven't touched a Samsung device since the Samsung Blackjack 13 years ago. I was on the Huawei P20 Pro before moving to the S10+. Finally, the following are my opinions and experience... YMMV. &amp;#x200B; Device : Exynos S10 + 128GB Prism White, bought from local telco Singtel &amp;#x200B; Settings : Dark Mode, WQHD+, Reduced Animations, Reduced Animation Time to 0.5x in Developer Settings. &amp;#x200B; Design : Glass sandwich with a almost all screen front. For me, the thing that makes this stand out is the curved display. I know there is some hate for it but this is my first smartphone with a curved display and I love it. Makes the P20 Pro, which is less than a year old, seem ancient. &amp;#x200B; Screen : I read what DisplayMate said about the screen and I concur. Best display I've seen on a smartphone hands down. One of the first settings I change was from the default FHD+ to WQHD+. The display just seems seamless, with the curved display giving the illusion of the screen melting off into the sides. However, the WQHD+ might have affected battery life. More on that later. &amp;#x200B; Fingerprint Scanner (FSP) : The FSP has been a hit or a miss so far but I am getting better at it everytime I unlock my phone. A lot of people have said you dont have to use pressure and you just have to tap. It's more like a prolonged tap and as a YouTuber has shown, tapping and leaving your thumb there takes the exact same time to unlock. It just seems faster for you since your thumb doesn't stay on the screen for long but the time taken to go to your homescreen is the same. The update seems to have helped the FSP too. &amp;#x200B; Software : One of the reasons I didn't use Samsung phones for so long was TouchWiz. I hated what they did to Android. But damn, OneUI is amazing. So amazing that I haven't even changed the default launcher to Nova... yet. Of course the default launcher doesn't have the customizability or the gestures of Nova. It's a simplified version but it's fast and smooth. Gets the job done. OneUI has been smooth in the limited time I have used it, no lags or slowdowns noticed. I have also remapped the Bixby button to Assistant using XDA's excellent tool. Also using AdHell 3 as I cannot stand ads. I am glad you don't need to be rooted to block ads on S10. I know there are non-root tools like Blockada that exist but I just prefer an on-device solution. &amp;#x200B; Camera : Haven't used them much but in the very limited test shots I did, all the cameras produced better than expected pictures. I was expecting average looking pictures, especially since I am coming from the excellent cameras in the P20 Pro. But the S10+ stood its ground. None of the overexposed looking pictures from previous Samsungs. They look... natural. Of course, more samples need to be taken but as first impressions, I am impressed. One thing to note is that the physical aperture mechanism of the main lens seem to be audible. I don't know if that's the case with the S9 as well but its very noticeable on the S10+. &amp;#x200B; Battery : Frankly, the only thing I have been disappointed about the S10+. Bear in mind its only been 24 hours. The device hasn't had the time to learn my habits and use AI to regulate battery yet. But the battery on my S10+ seems to be ticking down really fast, even in normal usage. I am hoping it gets better in a week. Lets see. &amp;#x200B; Others : Haven't tried PowerShare yet so I can't comment. I don't plan on using the Galaxy Buds I got with my purchase as well. One thing that really impressed me was the sound from the speakers. They are loud and with Atmos enabled, they just sound a lot better to my ears. Buttons are all nice and clicky but the power button is positioned really high for some reason. If you have small hands (even for some people with big hands), this might be an issue. But with double tap to wake you might not need to use the Power button as much. &amp;#x200B; Well, that's all I have folks for now. If you are contemplating getting the S10, go get it. You will not regret it. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;""]",0.047,0.831,0.122,0.9966

I recieved it back a week ago, and used it for a little over 4 days when the watch powered off and never turned back on (it was fully charged the night before so it was not a battery issue). Watch was sent back again for repairs, and an email back was sent stating the watch was out of warranty due to water damage, with a repair cost of $600. In the period of 4 days I used it, it was never submerged or rinsed in any kind of liquid. After multiple calls and being on hold collectively for 3-4 hours, I was connected both to the repair center who was quite rude and hung up on me after I explained the issue, and level 2 support who just repeated that water damage is not covered under warranty after I admitted that it may have gotten splashed from washing my hands. All the tier 1 support seem to agree the problem was strange but there's nothing they could do. Now it seems pretty unreasonable that a watch they claim is ATM5 and capable of being submerged to 50M can have it's warranty voided from splashes in the sink, not to mention that the repair cost is almost double of what a brand new watch costs. I can only guess that something happened to it either during the first repair, or the water seals were not installed or incorrect, but at this point it seems like I'm not going to get anywhere with having it repaired or replaced. Their products have always been reliable to me up to this point, have had the first Galaxy phone up till my current Note 9 but this experience is making me do a double take on how they back their products. Anyone else experience a problem like this or is this pretty odd?

I ordered the verizon model as that is my carrier and have yet to recieve a shipping notifucation and on the my orders page it still says shipping by march 8th. What is wierd is both my roommates got an s10 and their are both arriving today. The worst part is that they both ordered after me. One on the 21st and one on the 23rd. The one on the 23rd also ordered the verizon model and it said it would arrive the 15th. The only difference is that i live in connecticut so i sent it there. Has anyone else in connecticut gotten theirs yet or is there a problem with my order.

146,2019-03-07 17:59:29,"[""**What is Good Lock?** Good Lock is made up of different modules (applications) used to customize your device developed by Samsung. The lockscreen, navigation bar, status bar, quick panel and more can be completely customized and modified to your liking. But that's not all, it also includes other functions that change the way you use your device, like gestures and the MultiStar app, which provides the multi-window functionality from Samsung Experience that was deleted in OneUI because of Google Policy. **Why the sudden fuss about it?** With OneUI, almost all of the Good Lock modules stopped working properly. Finally Good Lock has been updated providing compatibility with OneUI as well as many new features. **Where can I download?** You can download Good Lock through the Galaxy Store, however it is not available in all regions. If you can't find it you'll have to download and install the APK files manually. I collected all of the Good Lock APKs and can be downloaded conveniently here: **I can't find the apps, where are they?** If you decided to install the apps manually, you won't find all of them in your app drawer. The included Bad Lock application in the above link can be used to launch some of the Good Lock modules, however it was designed to work with the old Good Lock, so it may crash when trying to open some apps and does not contain the full list of modules. To open the Good Lock apps not listed in Bad Lock (MultiStar, NavStar, Nice Catch, etc.) you'll need an activity launcher or an app which can create an activity widget. An easy way to do this would be to download Nova Launcher. Find it on Google Play, you do not need the paid version and you don't have to use it after installing. On your home screen, go to widgets then find and drag and drop the 'Activities' widget. From there, select a Good Lock app and choose the main activity (usually the first one). Then you'll be able to use the app like any other. **Notes:** - To use Good Lock you'll need to have a Samsung device running Android 8.0 or higher. There are a few modules that require Android 8.1 or higher and others Android 9. You can try previous versions of the apps from Good Lock 2018 to see if those work instead. - Sound Assistant is yet to be updated by Samsung. - A new Good Lock module, called 'NotiStar', is planned to be released at the end of the month. - The modules are usually updated monthly. You can download the apps manually from apkmirror.com once they are available. I will also try to keep the provided link updated as possible. - As of writing this post, the new Good Lock is not yet compatible with the Galaxy S10 series.""]",0.039,0.819,0.142,0.995

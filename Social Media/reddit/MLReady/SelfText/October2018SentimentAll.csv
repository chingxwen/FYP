The Note 9 seems to have the best features, I’m mostly worried it’ll be too big to carry in my pocket and I don’t do the belt carry thing. My main needs are that it has a battery that can last at least a full shift at work (anywhere from 8-10 hours) and is -somewhat- sturdy enough to survive if I fall on it, if I have to fight with it in my pocket, etc (of course a case is my primary purchase after the phone).

Right now i'm twisted between getting the Iphone X (yes the X not XS/XR/XSM) or the Note 9. Both are going to be the same price from where I get it from (so price isn't an issue for me here) but what will influence my decision will be if the Airpods sound worse on the note 9 because I don't want an unbearable experience. You could say 'Lend just get the IconX then'. No, I can't, i've already bought the airpods which you could call my mistake, but they just seem a lot more comfortable to deal with than the icon X and prettier in my opinion. The case is just nicer for the airpods. I believe that the Note 9 is better than the Iphone X and to be honest I prefer the sexier note 9 and the more beautiful screen but god damn I also love the IOS economy.

Here are my thoughts: S9 - Pros: smaller handset but still a bigger screen than I have now (I have smallish hands), lower price (not my primary concern, but it's still a pro); Cons: I'm concerned about going to a smaller battery given my battery life issues with my S7 Edge, lesser features than S9+ or Note 9 (though I'm not sure how much the second rear facing camera, extra RAM, and/or storage would impact me). S9+ - I really like the features, but the size might be unwieldy. I also don't love how oblong this phone is; yeah, the screen is technically bigger, but it's a skinny rectangle so how useful is that, really?

Takes about 10 or so minutes and I highly recommend doing this: 1. Remove silicon earbud 2. You should see mesh plating. Take a paper clip or something similar and push against an edge of the mesh at an angle. Try not to push directly down as this will push the mesh in rather than sliding it around for removal. 3. Remove the inner piece that you will see. It\'s basically a cloth with glue along the outer ring that allows Samsung to claim water ""resistance"". Picture of this \'cloth\' 4. Place mesh back, be sure to press along the outer ring with a paper clip to ensure mesh is firmly in place. Do this at your discretion as you may risk damaging it with any sweat or dust that can get in more easily now. But this makes your earbuds tolerable again as sound will be even now. Personally, I cut up a piece of paper towel and place it over the mesh on the outside to allow for easy, frequent change while providing adequate protection. As you can see in the pic from the link, my earwax was the cause of essentially filling up the cloth and blocking noise further, especially compared to my left.

Recently noticed puddles of water on the floor below the fridge, which coincided with slushy ice, reduced ice volume &amp; dispense speed, water filling the little catch/evaporation tray below the dispenser and significant amounts of water collecting in the bins inside the door below the ice maker shoot. At first I assumed the door wasn\'t being fully shut though after several mornings of finding fresh water puddles despite confirming both doors were firmly closed each night before going to bed, it was clear something was wrong. Decided to dig around the interwebs. Got as far as typing ""Samsung ice"" when Google suggested ""Samsung ice maker lawsuit"" - Article after article, even Samsung\'s own community site, chronicled exactly what I was experiencing to the letter. Based on what I\'ve read so far, it seems there is no true ""fix"", rather the problem is a fundamental design flaw of the entire ice making and dispensing system, specifically fatal insulation defects ranging from gaps on all sides, inside and out, of the ice maker itself to woefully inadequate gaskets such as the one meant to seal the door and ice shoot when closed, allowing non-freezing temperature air from the fridge to infiltrate the ice box, rendering the device incapable proper operation, leading to melted ice, water leakage, over frosting and a cascade of associated mechanical failures as parts systematically lock up and burn out. Since 2015, at least two service bulletins were issued by Samsung to their service technicians acknowledging the defects and prescribing mandatory ""fixes"", in some cases with special hardware kits, all without notifying customers, allowing ignorance to effectively robbing their consumers of the opportunity to address the defects under warranty, before the defects manifested in actionable malfunctions, which typically begins shortly after the 12 month warranty expires. TBH, I was surprised when my reddit searches about the lawsuit came back empty. Has anyone else heard of or know anything about this?

I only have a handful of apps installed, such as: * Evie launcher (I've also used Apex, Nova, Go, and the default Samsung) * Spotify * Keep * MyMail * OurGroceries * Textra * Amazon * Business calendar * Calendar snooze * Fitbit * Ecobee * Liftmaster (garage door thing) * Lyft * Mint * Starbucks * A file sync tool * My bank I've disabled/removed the games, and unneeded apps like NFL, Slacker Radio, Handcom office, etc. The problem that happens very often is I will be listening to music, or texting, or using Google maps, and someone will call me ... and **the phone will lag so much that the call screen will never appear**. I can hear the phone ringing, but the screen is black. There is no way to see who is calling or answer it. Obviously, this is a bit of a problem if I'm waiting for a work call. I've factory reset the phone at least 6 times, removed nearly all the apps, and it still happens. I even got a new S7 from Verizon (warranty) and it does the same thing! Is it just me? It makes me a little mad that the phone is pretty much useless after just two years. Yeah, it would be nice to upgrade, but I don't feel like shelling out $800 for a new phone to solve a problem that didn't exist a few years ago. So tell me what idiot thing I am doing wrong (besides not owning an iPhone).""]",0.101,0.825,0.074,-0.8721

I am far from the only one with this issue, just google ""Samsung gear S3 charge issue"" and find some forum post and go to the most recent, I started having this issue about the same time as the rest (2-3 days ago) There is no obvious cause for this issue, location services is randomly turning itself on, or at the very least no longer automatically turns itself off after a workout (run specifically). I used to have it last at least one day, I heard this used to do 3-4 from looking at old forum posts. I got it to last from waking up (7 AM) until 10:30 today before I was forced to charge it as I keep my charger with me... you never know.

On both devices, experienced the issue wherein if the battery died, the device would no longer accept a charge (I manage a cell phone store, know it's dead). I called Samsung customer service and they had me send in my device for repair - swapped the battery, no biggie. However, this happened 3 more times on my device and 2 more times on my Wife's device in the course of 6 months. I also noticed that a lot of my customers with the S8 and Note 8 series devices were coming in with the same issue. So I knew it wasn't environmental, it was a bad MBR issue (didn't cut off power at 5% like every phone since forever). On the 4th warranty call August 8th, I talked with a rep who stated that just to stop with all the issues that they would be sending me out a new Note 8 instead of simply replacing the battery on the device. I was satisfied with that, and accepted the terms given. However, 3 weeks went by and I didn't receive the replacement. I looked at the tracker, and they had received it almost immediately. So there was no reason for the delay. I called into care again, and was told I would be contacted within 3 business days with a resolution. No call. Instead I was mailed a refurbished Samsung S8. I called care again, explaining the situation, and was told I would receive a call from a supervisor in 48 hours. No call. I called again, asked for a supervisor, and was told I would be contacted by THEIR supervisor in 48 hours. No call. 3 more calls, I'm not making this up. I went as high as the call center COULD go. Waited on the phone for 2:02:14 before I spoke with a person who told me that I would not receive my replacement until they got their S8 back. So they sent me a label via email. I asked the person what kind of device I would be getting back at this point. He told me a refurbished Note 8. This is 10 weeks later. I will never purchase Samsung products again. I will never sell Samsung products to any customer again. I will instruct my team to explain the Samsung Plus experience to their customers to keep them from buying that product.

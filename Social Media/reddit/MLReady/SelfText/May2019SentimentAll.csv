So the phone was replaced with an exact model. Well... ...On the previous phone I could rotate the home screen from portrait to landscape, and the phone would flip display modes. So I tried to re-instate that feature on this replacement, only to not be able to rotate the home screen. Yes, apps rotate when flipped to landscape. Yes, I called Verizon technical support, and Verizon even got in contact with Samsung, only to have Verizon tell me that feature was never available for that model phone. The help technician double-checked with me regarding the capability of changing display modes for home screens, app screens, and I confirmed I could do it with the previous phone. She seemed confused. So was I, as I clearly remember being able to flip the phone to landscape in home screen mode. Did I miss something? Is there a feature or setting I'm completely overlooking? Any assistance would be appreciated. **TLDR**: I used to be able to change the orientation of my home screens to either landscape or portrait, now I cannot.

I might be more oriented to the Note 9 because its technically at the same price that the S10e and has more features. Although the S10 gets ""more equal"" to the Note 9...

I never used a Samsung because everything I had ever read was that touchwiz was trash and every picture I could find had weird comic sans or comedy fonts and reviews suggested a confusing mishmash of features. Then I got a deal on an A70 which uses the oneUI and from an user interface point of view I've been pleasantly surprised. The interface is clean and easy to use and it had made me rethink my thoughts on this idea of 'stock is best'. If I wanted a relatively stock experience it's fairly easy to turn off pretty much everything and get something similar to that. However I've realised that by and large the various options that you are presented with enhance the experience if you spend a little time with them and I know view stock as 'lacking features'. I do wonder how many people are missing out of Samsung because their perception of what you get is as out of date as mine?""]",0.032,0.857,0.111,0.9643

So far the only common problem that is covered is battery replacement, so **I'm curious if there is anything else useful covered by Samsung smartphone warranty**. &amp;#x200B; List of cases that I found: **Not covered** (all according to Samsung Warranty Policy) * Damage due to misuse (physical, electrical or heat). I assume this will cover pretty much every case of physical damage to the device such as scratched/cracked screens, broken buttons, broken ports(?). Cracked screens are kind of funny because the official clear view/LED View cases seem to be a cause for a decent amount of cracked screens (phone in case falling, and then on impact the phone falls out of the case). * Water damage... fairly odd, for a waterproof phone. Apart from warranty policy I also recall reading about several cases of Samsung services refusing to honor warranty because the phone had water damage. * Acts of God..... I'm not sure what that means, but I figured I'd include it, just because it gave me the image of Thor coming down from heavens, slapping the phone out of my hands and then smashing it with his hammer (with sparks and lightnings of course). **Partially covered** (contradictory stories from different sources)**:** * Screen burn in. [This samsung community question]( and [this reddit thread]( say it's covered, but comments in the second thread say that Samsung doesn't do these replacements in Poland. [A certain CNET article]( highlights that burn in is only covered **only for normal consumer use** and not business use. Then again this article starts talking about phones and then switches to TVs, so.... take it with a grain of salt. **Covered** (couldn't found contradictory info)**:** * [Battery problems]( (including another thread, linked in this one) says it is covered. Warranty policy does say that overcharging is not covered, but I couldn't find any people that had problems with that. Not sure how they would diagnose that either. **Basically I wanna know what other warranty claims were honored or not honored** to get a better view of value of this warranty**.** To give you a few examples: SD/Sim Card suddenly not being recognized, speakers crackling up, phone restarting, etc.""]",0.095,0.8,0.105,0.788

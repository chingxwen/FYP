3,2018-09-01 01:24:56,"['I honestly think Samsung fanboys are worse than Apple fanboys. There main argument that Samsung is better is that Apple copies Samsung, yet, there is an entire 120-some page document that Samsung made to copy Apple’s phones and software. They all hate on Apple even though they have never tried an Apple device saying that Samsung phones are just all around better. Some even say that they bought an iPhone X and the Galaxy s9 or another Samsung phone and said it was better, just to make there point more valid. Yet I have never met or heard of anyone that isn’t a popular tech reviewer who would spend around 2000 dollars to get two flagship phones from different brands just to compare them. Samsung’s newest flagship the Note9 on paper is a beast compared to the iPhone X, but in everyday use and geek bench scores, the iPhone X is faster. The note 9 has 8Gb of ram, compared to the iPhone X’s 3, yet the iPhone, which will be a year old in September, is still faster. That is because of software optimization, which is lacking in android. iOS isn’t open source, meaning that Apple fine tunes iOS to be the best it can. Also, with iOS, you don’t have to wait 7 centuries for you to get the newest update because Apple made sure they control that. Meanwhile, Samsung phones have to wait for the carrier and a whole bunch of other things before you get the newest update. Brands like Oppo and Huawei are getting the update for Android P yet Samsung, the main oem for Android and the brand people think of when they think of android has no phones confirmed to get the update. It’s kinda ridiculous. The S8 is the oldest phone expected to get the update sometime in the next 5 decades, which is kinda sad considering that the S7 exists and came out only 2 years ago. Yet on iOS, the iPhone 5S is still getting iOS 12. That phone came out in 2013. That’s 5 years ago, yet a 2 year old Samsung phone isn’t getting anymore updates. A child can be born and learn how to walk, and learn how to speak a language and be in there second year of school (in the US) in that span of time. I think you get the idea of how long 5 years actually is. There are also rumours that iPhones like the X and others can start getting updates longer because of how powerful and future proof they are. Yet Samsung phones aren’t even getting more than 2 years worth of updates. Every phone has there flaws, and I am not denying that iPhones and Apple themselves don’t have there flaws, but in my opinion I just think that iPhones and Apple in general are just better. I wanted to do this because I haven’t seen very many people say these different points. Yes, there are posts and videos saying that Apple is better than Samsung and blah blah blah, but I haven’t seen very many things on Samsung fanboys or some of the other stuff I just said. I also don’t hate Samsung by any means, they do a lot of great things and make a lot of great innovations. But they have copied Apple ALOT and you can’t deny that. I have definitely gone off topic because this was originally about Samsung Fanboys and not Samsung Phones etc but whatever.

After having the pink line problem in the screen of my galaxy s7 edge, I really wanted a new phone and since I love Samsung, I decided to get the new cool looking Galaxy S8. Now, about a year later I started having problems with my screen again. About 3/4 of my 5.8 inch s8's screen has extremely bad oled burn and the lines have over time started to look kind of pinkish. I have tried every fix the internet has to offer about fixing the screen but nothing works. When looking and asking for the prices of a screen replacement to get rid of it, I only found that the cheapest price in my area was around 279 USD to 350 USD. Spending that kind of money on a replacement for a phone that you can nowdays get for 500 at a bestbuy and such is absolutely mad to me. It is really distracting and watching youtube in full screen has become so annoying and having reddit's white mode is impossible.

Chose the ATK headphones for promotional item, and purchased a single fast-charging wireless charger. **8/11-8/21** Watched many YouTube videos and scanned numerous Reddit threads and various other online feeds about the Note 9 in anticipation of receiving mine. Don’t pretend like some of you didn’t do the very same thing. 8/22 Received my beautiful 512 Note 9, lavender purple, unlocked, purchased from Samsung.com. Excited, of course. Already bought two phone cases and the Whitestone Dome screen protector. That\'s how excited. Opened the box, turned on the phone…..the screen had a faint line on the left side running from top to bottom of the phone. My excitement dimmed. Went online to see if anyone else had the issue and/how to fix it, and sure enough someone else said they experienced the same thing and after restarting their phone, the line went away. So, I did the same thing and sure enough, the line went away. Assuming the issue was fixed, I installed my Whitestone screen protector and used Smart Switch to transfer data/info from old phone (that I used for my trade-in). Boxed up my trade-in phone and sent it back using the return label/box. **8/23** Read more online comments about Note 9 screen bleeds and other issues people were having right out of the box, so I called Samsung.com customer service right away in the morning (8:25am), and talked to four different people (Luis, Sasha, Ronna, and Melissa) in just over two hours; I was bounced from one department to another (I was even sent to the warranty department and issued a ticket at one point) and eventually transferred back to customer service. I explained to each of them that I wanted to exchange my phone because it was defective right out of the box and I didn\'t want to take any chances since I spent so much. What I was told (and Samsung records all their calls, so if anyone has access to those, I urge you to listen to them, because their customer service personnel are awful and knowledgeable) that Samsung “doesn’t do” exchanges, they only issue returns. And I would need to return all my items from the order, including the free promotional ATK headphones and the fast wireless charger I purchased. Once I returned it, I could create another order through the website (Samsung.com), and when I received THAT new phone, I would need to call and request a code to order promotional headphones, or whatever promotional item they had available. I explained to Samsung.com customer service that I was unable to send them the phone back because I just sent them my back-up phone for the trade-in, so I would be without a phone until they sent me one; and since the phone I ordered was on backorder, it wouldn’t be until October until they could send me one. Talking to Melissa (10:42am of this call), she suggested that I call FedEx to have them stop the return of my back-up phone, and when I got that one back, go ahead and proceed with my Note 9 return. Frustrated of course, I said I’ll give that a try, and she issued return labels for me to send back my defective Note 9, which are good until 9/7, so that should be enough time to get my phone back and transfer the data/info again and send my new Note 9 back. **8/24 - 8/27** Fedex wasn’t accommodating….at all. Called Samsung.com customer service (8/27 2:12pm) and talked to Diana. After explaining my situation, I’m noticing that these agents are focusing on how I don’t want to send back my promotional item (which I said I didn’t want to because I got it for pre-ordering), and their tone is accusational (not a real word, but I mean it felt like they were accusing me of pre-ordering JUST to get the promotional item and then just keep it or something), but I do my best to explain that ““I’m the customer and I received a product that was defective right out of the box, and I thought just restarting it would fix it, and it seemed to, so I put the most expensive protective screen on it, but it’s a few days later, and the line is back on the screen and even darker than before, and I’m just trying to get a non-defective phone without a bunch of hassle, and nobody seems to understand that I don’t have a back-up phone, and getting one will cost even more money, and you’re trying to make me jump through a bunch of hoops just to fix something that should’ve been as easy as, “No problem, ma’am, we’ll send you a new phone and you just send us back the defective one in the box and return label we provide you”….THAT’S how the initial conversation should’ve gone!”” How the conversation went: I was that person on the phone just rambling my frustrations to a very-new customer service employee who probably just started their shift twelve minutes earlier, and they couldn’t help me nor could they transfer me to their manager because they were on the phone with another customer. I said I’d call back the next day. **8/28** Called Samsung.com customer service after work (4:03pm) and talked to a seemingly-helpful young lady who listened to my situation and said she understood how frustrating it must be, getting a defective phone and now not being able to send it back because I don’t have a back-up phone. She let me vent about how UN-customer-service-like it is to put all the fix-the-situation effort back onto the customer rather than have the vendor apologize for the defective phone and make it right. She said she would escalate my ticket and someone from that department would email me within 24 hours and I could converse directly with them to fix it. **8/30** Called Samsung.com customer service (used my work phone, so I don’t have the actual time, but it was before lunch) to check on the escalated ticket, and the young man said it could take up to 72 hours for an escalated ticket to be responded to. So I wait. **9/6** Called Samsung customer service (11:08am) Talked to a male representative and explained that the return label I have for returning my defective Note 9 expires tomorrow and I still haven’t heard from this “escalated team” from last week, and I’ve been very patient with them, and he responds by saying that he doesn’t see a request for an escalated ticket, so I correct him with the details of the date and time the ticket was requested and he said that his screen doesn’t show that, so I asked to talk to his supervisor. He placed me on hold a bunch of times, each time letting me know that his supervisor is on the phone with another customer. He finally answers and tells me that his supervisor is still on the phone, but he’ll have them call me back within an hour. Before hanging up, I confirmed that he had my correct phone number. Over three hours later, I hadn’t received any calls, so I call “customer service” again (2:28pm). First I spoke to a female representative and explained my urgent situation with the expiring return labels, but she was unable to help me, so I asked to speak with her supervisor and was put on hold several times. She got back on the phone with me every 5 minutes to let me know that she was still there, and I told her that I appreciated her checking back with me. Her supervisor, “Melissa out of the Toronto Canada call center”, finally was on the phone and I again explained the urgency of the situation, and she said she would request an extension to have someone issue new return labels. Since she was a “supervisor” I asked her a bunch of questions about my situation and why I just wasn’t able to get my defective phone replaced, and her rote response was that it wasn’t Samsung’s policy. I wish I would’ve recorded at least this last call because it just floored me with her demeanor. I felt like she didn’t understand why I was so frustrated. I mean, I summarized my experience for her and she didn’t seem to understand what my issue was with just sending back my whole order; she kept responding with, “Samsung doesn’t have an exchange process, they only have a return process.” If I wanted to keep my pre-order promotional item, I would need to use the warranty, which is a different company. I asked her to confirm that the request was made for the return-label extension and then hung up. The next morning, I got an email from their return-label extension dept: *Jennifer B. (Samsung E-Commerce)* *Sep 7, 10:05 EDT* *Good Morning XXXXXXX,* *I am contacting you regarding your Samsung.com order, xxxxxxx. I understand that you are requesting a return label for the defective Note 9 that you had received. Unfortunately, we are unable to issue a new return label at this time being that one had already been sent to you. I have resent this return label to your email address,* [*xx725@gmail.com*](mailto:jxx725@gmail.com) *and the deadline to have this product sent out is today, September 7, 2018 to prevent rejection by the warehouse.* **9/9** So, that’s Samsung.com’s customer service. A combination of “Sorry, not sorry” and “Figure it out for yourself” and “We don’t really know what we’re doing” and “You’re not a customer, you’re just a ticket number with these fragmented notes on my screen that 14 different reps have input over the course of two weeks”.. As a long-time Samsung.com customer (S6, S7, S7 Edge, Note 8, S9+), I guess I can be glad that this is the first and last time I’ll ever have to deal with Samsung.com customer service. All my other phones arrived without defect and the trade-ins went without issue. But this experience has left me with a different perspective of the whole Samsung company and I won’t be buying any more of their products until the frustration wears off. Which really stinks because I had plans to do some serious Christmas gifts this year. Needless to say, I’m going to have to invest in a temporary phone to use and contact the warranty people. Yep, I’m going to use the one-time warranty on a phone that came out of the box defective. Perhaps I’ll get lucky and never need the warranty for anything else. In other news, I found some YouTube videos that demonstrate being reeeeeeally careful to remove the Whitestone screen protector in order to re-apply it…so I might not have to buy another one of those. Here’s to maybe having a silver lining in all of this. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; [\\\\""The line\\\\"".](']",0.044,0.91,0.045,-0.9067

I explained my problem and he said it needed a new display, which I knew, so I agreed on the fee of £220 and he started taking information about the phone (serial numbers, model number) A couple of minutes later he came back to me and said that my phone was sold in the United Arab Emirates (I'm from the UK) and that the parts and layout of the phone was different to those of the European Model and they didn't have the parts in stock This was kind of a bummer but what can you do?, he'll order in some parts and I'll come back in a week or two to get it repaired then right? Wrong. He told me that he was unable to get the parts I required and my only option was to either contact Samsung international and hope they do something or go to UAE myself. This is absolutely ridiculous, the fact that I spent a lot of money on this phone, and the fact that I'm willing to spend half of what I payed for the phone for a display is already insane enough, but now they can't even ship over a display for my phone? It doesn't matter where the hell my phone originated from, Samsung is Samsung and it should care about it's customers enough to send me parts for my phone if I require them. It's like going to repair your car. It doesn't matter where the car is from, if the customer needs a part that the mechanic doesn't have, they will order it into their repair centre in order to fix the car. I don't see why Samsung is an exception. I've chosen to spend my money (and a lot of it) on Samsung, not Apple, not Google, they should be there to fulfil my concerns and needs, especially when I'm throwing £220 in their face.

Now I know that next year I will be able to trade it in and get the Note 10 but I was curious to see if in the past they offered limited time early upgrades for like the S9 or S9+? I ask because the S10 leaks seem to be awesome and I would honestly be 100% willing to upgrade to every new flagship phone if it was possible. I am okay waiting for the Note 10 but I was curious. This wasnt even a thought/idea when I was with Apple because they only released their phones at the same time every year. So I am glad that even if it doesnt exist now that maybe this will be an option in the future.'],0.016,0.8,0.184,0.9772

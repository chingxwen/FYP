More expensive panels have better colour reproduction, better viewing angles, and tend to be held to a higher quality control standard so tend to last longer. At the highest end of these panels currently available to consumers would be Samsung's QLED, and LG/Sony's OLED. OLED has the advantage of getting perfect blacks as each LED generates it's own light, eliminating the need of a backlight, and allowing OLEDs to be the most colour accurate panels. However, QLED is brighter, so it works better in a brighter room, and it doesn't have the risk of burn-in like OLEDs have.\\n\\nThen there's what type of backlighting the TV uses. For simplicity I'll keep it to edge lighting, and full array lighting. Edge lighting is cheaper, but you get the drawbacks of worse image and colour quality, and you can notice dropoffs in brightness on certain parts of the screen. Full array lighting has LEDs spread all behind the panel for a more uniform and consistent backlight.\\n\\nHigh Dynamic Range (HDR) is a feature that has become more common on TVs in the past few years. [Linus over here can explain it better than I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wthhc1s0Pig). \\n\\nNext is 4K upscaling. Almost no cable signal does 4K, unless you have a fiber optic TV box. So to get your standard cable signal filling up the full 4K screen, the TV has to upscale the signal, which basically means it has to generate extra pixels that weren't originally there. Generally, the more expensive the TV, the better the upscaling is. Right now Sony seems to have the best upscaling chips. Of course, you can get 4k content from online sources, or from a 4K Blu-Ray player with 4K disc though.\\n\\nOther than that, as you pay more, Smart TV functionalities tend to be better and more snappy, speakers get better, etc. \\n\\nThe main reason I would rather buy a TV from the big guys (Samsung, Sony, LG), rather than the small guys (Hisense, RCA, etc.) is overall quality and support.

I have the pros and a pair with anc.  I have two pairs because I don't always charge them everyday and when one dies I just swap them out for the other pair and charge the dead ones in my car.  I'm lucky enough to be in a semi construction job where I can wear these all day.  \\nI listen to music often but audio books are what I listen to the most. So on to the good news.\\nWork time..yes you will get 8 hrs out of these easily. I can make it a full day with music or books but most time I am starting and stopping often or taking calls..my working partner bought some after trying mine and loves them also. \\nNow for the anc. I would say that it is decent. I think the main advantage is that they are ear buds and have a passive ability to block sound as it is so the anc doesn't have to be spectacular. I have been in loud server rooms for a whole day and don't know how I would have lived without the anc. It really helps but if you're looking for Bose quiet comfort level of anc it's not going to happen..those things are crazy good. As far as battery life. It's going to take a hit with anc on..if I had to guess because I haven't run anc all day for a while, I would say about 6 hours maybe a bit more. The good news is that these things charge very fast..you can plug them in for 15-20 min and get 1.5 hrs. \\nSound wise..I think they are good.. decently loud although I don't think any wireless headphones are loud enough. You do have access to Samsungs uhq sound if your using a newer Galaxy and yes it makes quite the difference. The sound is much more crisp.  Bass wise they are good..not crazy bass but I think they are just fine..\\nComfort and build..I think they are very comfortable. I know not a lot of people like around the neck stuff but these are just fine..light weight and the build quality is the best out of the two. \\nWith pricing the way it has dropped lately I don't think you can go wrong with these..I was looking into the new around the neck headphones from Samsung but I don't think they support uhq or any other high def sound so that's a no go for me..\\nI purchased my standard pros at Sam's club for a good price and ordered the anc from Samsung. At the time they were fairly new so they were still pricy..\\nI hope this has helped you. I have had these for a while and the last thing I will say is that they are fairly durable. I am a pretty careful person with electronics but even still they are pretty strong.\\nGood luck .\", created_utc=1531126229, d_={'body': \"Ok, I will try to provide some feedback for you.

I'm lucky enough to be in a semi construction job where I can wear these all day.  \\nI listen to music often but audio books are what I listen to the most. So on to the good news.\\nWork time..yes you will get 8 hrs out of these easily. I can make it a full day with music or books but most time I am starting and stopping often or taking calls..my working partner bought some after trying mine and loves them also. \\nNow for the anc. I would say that it is decent. I think the main advantage is that they are ear buds and have a passive ability to block sound as it is so the anc doesn't have to be spectacular. I have been in loud server rooms for a whole day and don't know how I would have lived without the anc. It really helps but if you're looking for Bose quiet comfort level of anc it's not going to happen..those things are crazy good. As far as battery life. It's going to take a hit with anc on..if I had to guess because I haven't run anc all day for a while, I would say about 6 hours maybe a bit more. The good news is that these things charge very fast..you can plug them in for 15-20 min and get 1.5 hrs. \\nSound wise..I think they are good.. decently loud although I don't think any wireless headphones are loud enough. You do have access to Samsungs uhq sound if your using a newer Galaxy and yes it makes quite the difference. The sound is much more crisp.  Bass wise they are good..not crazy bass but I think they are just fine..\\nComfort and build..I think they are very comfortable. I know not a lot of people like around the neck stuff but these are just fine..light weight and the build quality is the best out of the two. \\nWith pricing the way it has dropped lately I don't think you can go wrong with these..I was looking into the new around the neck headphones from Samsung but I don't think they support uhq or any other high def sound so that's a no go for me..\\nI purchased my standard pros at Sam's club for a good price and ordered the anc from Samsung. At the time they were fairly new so they were still pricy..\\nI hope this has helped you. I have had these for a while and the last thing I will say is that they are fairly durable. I am a pretty careful person with electronics but even still they are pretty strong.\\nGood luck .\", 'created_utc': 1531126229}, created=1531097429), comment(body='Your submission has been removed from /r/samsung because your comment karma is below 5, this is in place to prevent spam.\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

More expensive panels have better colour reproduction, better viewing angles, and tend to be held to a higher quality control standard so tend to last longer. At the highest end of these panels currently available to consumers would be Samsung's QLED, and LG/Sony's OLED. OLED has the advantage of getting perfect blacks as each LED generates it's own light, eliminating the need of a backlight, and allowing OLEDs to be the most colour accurate panels. However, QLED is brighter, so it works better in a brighter room, and it doesn't have the risk of burn-in like OLEDs have.\\n\\nThen there's what type of backlighting the TV uses. For simplicity I'll keep it to edge lighting, and full array lighting. Edge lighting is cheaper, but you get the drawbacks of worse image and colour quality, and you can notice dropoffs in brightness on certain parts of the screen. Full array lighting has LEDs spread all behind the panel for a more uniform and consistent backlight.\\n\\nHigh Dynamic Range (HDR) is a feature that has become more common on TVs in the past few years. [Linus over here can explain it better than I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wthhc1s0Pig). \\n\\nNext is 4K upscaling. Almost no cable signal does 4K, unless you have a fiber optic TV box. So to get your standard cable signal filling up the full 4K screen, the TV has to upscale the signal, which basically means it has to generate extra pixels that weren't originally there. Generally, the more expensive the TV, the better the upscaling is. Right now Sony seems to have the best upscaling chips. Of course, you can get 4k content from online sources, or from a 4K Blu-Ray player with 4K disc though.\\n\\nOther than that, as you pay more, Smart TV functionalities tend to be better and more snappy, speakers get better, etc. \\n\\nThe main reason I would rather buy a TV from the big guys (Samsung, Sony, LG), rather than the small guys (Hisense, RCA, etc.) is overall quality and support.

Watching videos or scrolling through Instagram is very enjoyable and it gets hard to go back to other displays (we get spoiled :p)\\nThe camera is excellent too and if you're not a huge camera savvy, it will suit all your needs just fine and keep you going for a long time.\\nThe audio experience is really great too, plugged in or not. I underestimated having dual speakers as a feature but I end up using Dolby Atmos the most. Seriously, it's just fun to be able to play music in the house with your own phone speaker. Also, the AKG bundled earphones are pretty great too. Headphone jack is a plus.\\nS9 is surprisingly fast. I've had previous samsung phones and they always felt kind of slow, but this one doesnt lag and even after 4 months it performs the same as it did when I first got it.\\nBattery isnt its best feature but it comfortably gets me through 1 day and can last to 2 with some conservative usage.\\nThe software isnt as annoying and Android 8.0 adds a bonus too.

After that it charges slower and when I reach 90&amp;#37; it takes a full 20-30 minutes to hit 100. Which is normal behaviour. It acts this way to preserve the life of the battery.\\n\\nNow. Pure proof of what I said earlier is, first of all, the fact that battery technology works this way. If you will start using the other 15&amp;#37; percent of the battery til' you hit 0&amp;#37;, you'll realise that the 15&amp;#37; left is lasting longer than as much as 30&amp;#37; of your normal usage. My old S6 once lasted me around 13 minutes on 1&amp;#37;. I wanted to fully drain it and recharge it. And the last 1&amp;#37; lasted more than about 10&amp;#37; did. There are talks about these phenomenons on the internet. Won't bother trying to find them.\\n\\nMy analogy for you (and I'm ending on this note) is the fact that all current Samsung phones that support fast charging, have the same exact componentry for charging. My S9 does not charger any faster or slower than your A8 or my A5 or even J series phones that support fast charging. The power brick delivers 10W in fast charging mode. Maybe my S9 will be 1-2&amp;#37; more efficient in handling that, but not enough for it to be noticeable in the long run. You'll maybe save 30 minutes of charging per year due to that efficiency increase.\\n\\n[Here's a youtube video from a Hindi youtuber showing that in fact, it takes both the A8 and A8+ a normal amount of time to go from 0&amp;#37; to 100&amp;#37;.](https://youtu.be/KEIGhb6w4qg?t=88)\\n\\nAnd judging by the increases seen here, it's physically impossible for your A8 to reach 90&amp;#37; from 30&amp;#37; in just 20-30 minutes, let alone 15-20.\\n\\nUnless you had your phone repaired and you got a smaller battery placed in your phone (Something like 1500mA), you're either not aware of how long it actually takes to charge (because you're usually doing something else than spending time to check your phone religiously) or you're simply oblivious and pretty much assuming everything rather than basing off actual numbers.\\n\\nAnd with that I'm ending my thesis here. I have owned many samsung phones both before fast charging was a thing and after and I have noticed always how long it took to charge a phone. A note 4 for example, does indeed charge slower compared to something like an S7 while an S7 charges barely any slower compared to an S9. Why? The charging technology inside the phone has improved through time quite a bit. We moved most of the charging components into chargers (hence they get so hot when charging a phone), and now the phone simply has to do minimal work. The same charger that shipped with the Galaxy Note 4 (first official fast charging Samsung device) has identical hardware on the inside with any samsung adaptive fast charger sold today. Identical. It can charge both Quick Charge 2.0 devices &amp; Fast Charge 1.0 devices just well.\\n\\nAnd simply basing off the fact that the charger itself is identical, I can simply say our phones charge the same, exact same actually efficiency being slightly different from one phone to another but newer gen devices such as the A8 and S9 having virtually the same capability.\", created_utc=1531324087, d_={'body': \"TL;DR: Huge explanation bellow about charging these phones.

More expensive panels have better colour reproduction, better viewing angles, and tend to be held to a higher quality control standard so tend to last longer. At the highest end of these panels currently available to consumers would be Samsung's QLED, and LG/Sony's OLED. OLED has the advantage of getting perfect blacks as each LED generates it's own light, eliminating the need of a backlight, and allowing OLEDs to be the most colour accurate panels. However, QLED is brighter, so it works better in a brighter room, and it doesn't have the risk of burn-in like OLEDs have.\\n\\nThen there's what type of backlighting the TV uses. For simplicity I'll keep it to edge lighting, and full array lighting. Edge lighting is cheaper, but you get the drawbacks of worse image and colour quality, and you can notice dropoffs in brightness on certain parts of the screen. Full array lighting has LEDs spread all behind the panel for a more uniform and consistent backlight.\\n\\nHigh Dynamic Range (HDR) is a feature that has become more common on TVs in the past few years. [Linus over here can explain it better than I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wthhc1s0Pig). \\n\\nNext is 4K upscaling. Almost no cable signal does 4K, unless you have a fiber optic TV box. So to get your standard cable signal filling up the full 4K screen, the TV has to upscale the signal, which basically means it has to generate extra pixels that weren't originally there. Generally, the more expensive the TV, the better the upscaling is. Right now Sony seems to have the best upscaling chips. Of course, you can get 4k content from online sources, or from a 4K Blu-Ray player with 4K disc though.\\n\\nOther than that, as you pay more, Smart TV functionalities tend to be better and more snappy, speakers get better, etc. \\n\\nThe main reason I would rather buy a TV from the big guys (Samsung, Sony, LG), rather than the small guys (Hisense, RCA, etc.) is overall quality and support. You will experience MUCH better support from the bigger companies, not only in customer service, but also in setting up third party devices such as universal remotes, etc. The big guys tend to have more authorized service centers also, where as you're pretty much out of luck with the small guys.\", created_utc=1530655113, d_={'body': \"I work in retail selling TVs, computers, cameras, etc. There's MUCH more to what makes a TV other than the screen size and resolution. \\n\\nThe most basic, other than resolution, would be the panel type. More expensive panels have better colour reproduction, better viewing angles, and tend to be held to a higher quality control standard so tend to last longer. At the highest end of these panels currently available to consumers would be Samsung's QLED, and LG/Sony's OLED. OLED has the advantage of getting perfect blacks as each LED generates it's own light, eliminating the need of a backlight, and allowing OLEDs to be the most colour accurate panels. However, QLED is brighter, so it works better in a brighter room, and it doesn't have the risk of burn-in like OLEDs have.\\n\\nThen there's what type of backlighting the TV uses. For simplicity I'll keep it to edge lighting, and full array lighting. Edge lighting is cheaper, but you get the drawbacks of worse image and colour quality, and you can notice dropoffs in brightness on certain parts of the screen. Full array lighting has LEDs spread all behind the panel for a more uniform and consistent backlight.\\n\\nHigh Dynamic Range (HDR) is a feature that has become more common on TVs in the past few years. [Linus over here can explain it better than I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wthhc1s0Pig). \\n\\nNext is 4K upscaling. Almost no cable signal does 4K, unless you have a fiber optic TV box.

Absolutely loved the phone. Was a tad bit slipper when I was having my hands slightly wet from transpiration, decided to get a case before the beautiful glass was going to break one day. Was this close to getting the basic Samsung silicone black cover, didn't like the way it looked and the way it felt in the pocket, I then gave both the led cover (big fan in the past) case a view and then the clear view cover, said I wanted something different.\\n\\nI instantly wanted to get the alcantara one until I remembered it ruins itself once it touches water. I then instantly bought the protective standing cover. Do not regret it one bit even tho it looks a bit weird on the back. The phone altho heavier, is easier to hold in your hand, the button pressing feels really easy compared to the naked phone, the stand is a huge huge plus and the way the back is made, if I have money or papers in my pocket, I don't risk pulling it all out once I grab my phone. The only actual minus is the extra weight, the phone now easily passed the 200g mark and the physical size increased. One think I'm a huge fan of however, is the fact that I know how sensitive OLED panels can be to direct sunlight, this case has big protruding lips over the top and bottom of the phone.

Was a tad bit slipper when I was having my hands slightly wet from transpiration, decided to get a case before the beautiful glass was going to break one day. Was this close to getting the basic Samsung silicone black cover, didn't like the way it looked and the way it felt in the pocket, I then gave both the led cover (big fan in the past) case a view and then the clear view cover, said I wanted something different.\\n\\nI instantly wanted to get the alcantara one until I remembered it ruins itself once it touches water. I then instantly bought the protective standing cover. Do not regret it one bit even tho it looks a bit weird on the back. The phone altho heavier, is easier to hold in your hand, the button pressing feels really easy compared to the naked phone, the stand is a huge huge plus and the way the back is made, if I have money or papers in my pocket, I don't risk pulling it all out once I grab my phone. The only actual minus is the extra weight, the phone now easily passed the 200g mark and the physical size increased. One think I'm a huge fan of however, is the fact that I know how sensitive OLED panels can be to direct sunlight, this case has big protruding lips over the top and bottom of the phone.

Seriously, if you're going to permanently cover the thing then don't worry about its looks. But I accept that these things are fragile. There is a compromise. Put it in a pouch.

If you prove it isn't an app to Samsung, then you can get a free repair, or in extreme cases, a replacement.\", 'created_utc': 1531290510}, created=1531261710), comment(body='Your submission has been removed from /r/samsung because your comment karma is below 5, this is in place to prevent spam.\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you aren't in the mood to read, just watch the video linked bellow. It's showing pretty much everything I was saying up.

Only requirement is that I turn off wifi/data when doing so and I get about 40&amp;#37; in 30 minutes. After that it charges slower and when I reach 90&amp;#37; it takes a full 20-30 minutes to hit 100. Which is normal behaviour. It acts this way to preserve the life of the battery.\\n\\nNow. Pure proof of what I said earlier is, first of all, the fact that battery technology works this way. If you will start using the other 15&amp;#37; percent of the battery til' you hit 0&amp;#37;, you'll realise that the 15&amp;#37; left is lasting longer than as much as 30&amp;#37; of your normal usage. My old S6 once lasted me around 13 minutes on 1&amp;#37;. I wanted to fully drain it and recharge it. And the last 1&amp;#37; lasted more than about 10&amp;#37; did. There are talks about these phenomenons on the internet. Won't bother trying to find them.\\n\\nMy analogy for you (and I'm ending on this note) is the fact that all current Samsung phones that support fast charging, have the same exact componentry for charging. My S9 does not charger any faster or slower than your A8 or my A5 or even J series phones that support fast charging. The power brick delivers 10W in fast charging mode. Maybe my S9 will be 1-2&amp;#37; more efficient in handling that, but not enough for it to be noticeable in the long run. You'll maybe save 30 minutes of charging per year due to that efficiency increase.\\n\\n[Here's a youtube video from a Hindi youtuber showing that in fact, it takes both the A8 and A8+ a normal amount of time to go from 0&amp;#37; to 100&amp;#37;.](https://youtu.be/KEIGhb6w4qg?t=88)\\n\\nAnd judging by the increases seen here, it's physically impossible for your A8 to reach 90&amp;#37; from 30&amp;#37; in just 20-30 minutes, let alone 15-20.\\n\\nUnless you had your phone repaired and you got a smaller battery placed in your phone (Something like 1500mA), you're either not aware of how long it actually takes to charge (because you're usually doing something else than spending time to check your phone religiously) or you're simply oblivious and pretty much assuming everything rather than basing off actual numbers.\\n\\nAnd with that I'm ending my thesis here. I have owned many samsung phones both before fast charging was a thing and after and I have noticed always how long it took to charge a phone. A note 4 for example, does indeed charge slower compared to something like an S7 while an S7 charges barely any slower compared to an S9. Why? The charging technology inside the phone has improved through time quite a bit. We moved most of the charging components into chargers (hence they get so hot when charging a phone), and now the phone simply has to do minimal work.

More expensive panels have better colour reproduction, better viewing angles, and tend to be held to a higher quality control standard so tend to last longer. At the highest end of these panels currently available to consumers would be Samsung's QLED, and LG/Sony's OLED. OLED has the advantage of getting perfect blacks as each LED generates it's own light, eliminating the need of a backlight, and allowing OLEDs to be the most colour accurate panels. However, QLED is brighter, so it works better in a brighter room, and it doesn't have the risk of burn-in like OLEDs have.\\n\\nThen there's what type of backlighting the TV uses. For simplicity I'll keep it to edge lighting, and full array lighting. Edge lighting is cheaper, but you get the drawbacks of worse image and colour quality, and you can notice dropoffs in brightness on certain parts of the screen. Full array lighting has LEDs spread all behind the panel for a more uniform and consistent backlight.\\n\\nHigh Dynamic Range (HDR) is a feature that has become more common on TVs in the past few years.

So to get your standard cable signal filling up the full 4K screen, the TV has to upscale the signal, which basically means it has to generate extra pixels that weren't originally there. Generally, the more expensive the TV, the better the upscaling is. Right now Sony seems to have the best upscaling chips.

If you will start using the other 15&amp;#37; percent of the battery til' you hit 0&amp;#37;, you'll realise that the 15&amp;#37; left is lasting longer than as much as 30&amp;#37; of your normal usage. My old S6 once lasted me around 13 minutes on 1&amp;#37;. I wanted to fully drain it and recharge it. And the last 1&amp;#37; lasted more than about 10&amp;#37; did.

Won't bother trying to find them.\\n\\nMy analogy for you (and I'm ending on this note) is the fact that all current Samsung phones that support fast charging, have the same exact componentry for charging. My S9 does not charger any faster or slower than your A8 or my A5 or even J series phones that support fast charging. The power brick delivers 10W in fast charging mode. Maybe my S9 will be 1-2&amp;#37; more efficient in handling that, but not enough for it to be noticeable in the long run. You'll maybe save 30 minutes of charging per year due to that efficiency increase.\\n\\n[Here's a youtube video from a Hindi youtuber showing that in fact, it takes both the A8 and A8+ a normal amount of time to go from 0&amp;#37; to 100&amp;#37;.](https://youtu.be/KEIGhb6w4qg?t=88)\\n\\nAnd judging by the increases seen here, it's physically impossible for your A8 to reach 90&amp;#37; from 30&amp;#37; in just 20-30 minutes, let alone 15-20.\\n\\nUnless you had your phone repaired and you got a smaller battery placed in your phone (Something like 1500mA), you're either not aware of how long it actually takes to charge (because you're usually doing something else than spending time to check your phone religiously) or you're simply oblivious and pretty much assuming everything rather than basing off actual numbers.\\n\\nAnd with that I'm ending my thesis here.

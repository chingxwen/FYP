93fvs8,"Just got my hands on a S9+ for a decent price and have been messing around with it for a few hours. Going from the iPhone 6 to the S9+ is quite a step change in terms of well everything.. The screen for example makes the old iPhone 6 look like a Gameboy colour! But one of the other big differences is the sheer size of the thing.  

I like to use devices one handed, like when eating it’s good to be able to feed and do stuff on your phone at the same time. But although my hands are big enough to hold the S9+ in one hand and browse the net the issue is going back and forward on web pages.  On iOS you can swipe right  anywhere on the screen and it’ll take you back a page. On Android no such feature seems to exist by default. I’ve downloaded a few gesture apps but they seem to have the gesture bars towards the bottom end of the phone which is the hardest place to get to using one hand... 

So does anyone know if there is an app that allows you to use gestures on the full height of the phone or even a good portion of the middle as that would be a decent compromise?

Thanks for any helpful answers.",samsung,2018-07-31 16:18:48

93g0es,"I just recently got an unlocked S7 edge from an ebay seller as my first real smartphone and I'm finding it fine so far. However, I have a notification about the DM services and checking device status that never goes away. It's not too big an issue and I can live with it, but it would be nice to be able to get rid of it somehow.

From searching around it seems this issue has something to do with Sprint being the phones original provider (I live in Canada and am currently under Rogers). The only sprint apps I can find on my phone are Lookout and Voicemail (unless there is more buried somewhere in the files) which don't seem related to the notification. 

Is there anything I can do to stop this or is my phone just going to have this message forever?",samsung,2018-07-31 16:33:02

93itxk,"I've owned a Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 since last year and have recently been having audio issues. I can't really say if it is an issue that has always been there or if it only started happening recently because it only happens with some apps that I only recently installed. Basically there is audio occasional audio distortion when I am using certain apps. It doesn't happen all the time, and I don't think it is a hardware issue because I can reproduce it using both the built in speaker, a bluetooth speaker and headphones. 

I looked around online to find a solution and one place suggested that it may be the fault of an app that I installed and that I should try it on safe mode to see if it happens there. The only issue with that is that I don't have any issues with apps that are accessible with safe mode. Only ones that I downloaded, and even then only 3 of them. Before I start uninstalling apps and testing it out that way, does anyone have any suggestions?

Smart phone innovation is close to zero these days, both because it is hard and because most manufactures are not really motivated. Kudos to those that still keeps trying, even if they fail from time to time.

I temporarily switched from my S8+ to an iPhone 8 just to see how the other side lives for a couple weeks and im thinking of moving back over to my Samsung. Samsung still has all my stuff on it from pre-move and I basically just want to move everything back off the iphone onto the samsung without making a mess of what's already there.

And I bought the 'no S Pen' old Tab A from Staples this week because of the $100 price cut.  I could never rationalize / justify spending top dollar for the latest tablet.  It's a comfort form factor for a couple of games and reading e books, and being online...thats it for me.  The decent battery power is also terrific.  I've got a Note 8 phone that does mist everything really well when I'm on the go. 

Security:

The tablet still gets security patch updates... BUT receives just quarterly security patch updates now, not monthly.  Regardless, I use Bit Defender.

Pro Tip:

I bought the keyboard case made by Infiland off of Amazon, it fits the SM-T580 and SM-T555 for only $26 🇨🇦.  I could not be more pleased. 


I respect those who rather buy the latest and greatest... The bee S4 tablet is awesome, and a new Tab A is almost here... But a tablet is just a 'want' for me, not a need.

Let me start off with the fact that I do believe Samsung makes good products , I own numerous products from soundbars to T.V.s and am typing this on my note 8. 

But ,to have to fight with a company to spend money for 3 weeks  and then have both T.V. and Soundbar come in damaged then be told I have to wait 30 days plus transit time to be able to even get my money back and try again . You have lost your minds Samsung . This absolutely unacceptable. I dont even want a refund I just want the products I ordered undamaged in a timely manner .

Also as a side note is there a reason you guys use some knockoff UPS  to ship stuff? Who the hell is AGS?

94i0tn,"Hello folks!

I'm going to be upgrading my phone in a few days (my contract lets me upgrade once a year) and I've landed on either the Galaxy S9, the Galaxy S9 Plus or potentially the Huawei P20 Pro.

Right now it is leaning towards the Galaxy S9 Plus the most, as it seems to be packing the most features, a pretty decent battery life, and a great camera. The Huawei P20 Pro definitely gets better battery life which I am aware of, but it lacks quite some features I'd like to see, which Samsung has.

Either way, those of you with either the S9 or the S9 Plus, how would you say your phone manages during an ""average"" day? 

Battery life is the one thing I've always had issues with on every phone I have owned, except my latest iPhone 8 Plus, but even that one is starting to disappoint me lately. I'm by no means a super power user, but I do Snapchat quite a lot (which I know takes a lot of battery), but other than that I guess I spend most of my time on Reddit, or just playing around with the phone, nothing too intense. I also listen to music, check social media and stream stuff from time to time. 

If I have a slow day I'll probably do some gaming every now and then. 

But yeah, the reason why I'm asking this is that I'd really like to go back to a smaller form factor for my next phone (so the normal S9 would be perfect), and I would be willing to sacrifice the extra battery life if that ""extra"" isn't too much. But between the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus I definitely get a lot more juice out of mine than my friend does with his normal iPhone 8, and we have very similar use-cases. 

So to make my question a bit more clear - which phone of those two (or maybe three if we include the Huawei P20 Pro as well) do you have, and how well does it hold up during the day? What kind of user are you?",samsung,2018-08-04 09:46:49

Here are some excerpts from Samsung's official website (https://www.samsung.com/us/account/customization-service/):

&gt; *What types of information may the Customization Service collect about you?*

&gt; Device Information. The Customization Service may **collect your device’s unique identification information**, settings information (such as language and lock settings), status information (such as connections with other devices) and other information about your devices. The Customization Service also may check the applications installed or currently running on your device. In addition, the Customization Service may collect information about how, when and for how long you use the devices connected to your Samsung Account, including your usage of the Services and third-party apps and services on the devices (such as a **listing of apps on your devices, music played on your devices, the websites you visit and the searches you make**).

&gt; Music and Photos. The Customization Service may collect and analyze information such as titles, genres, and artists on previously played or saved music and information about your photos, such as the times and locations at which your saved photos were taken.

&gt; Contacts and Communications Data. The Customization Service may **access your contact list and may collect and analyze your incoming/outgoing call and text message history** to provide you with services, such as to determine your relationships with others (e.g., your family and friends), who your most important contacts are, who contacts you most frequently and your preferred contact method; to display information about your important contacts (e.g., missed calls); and to find contacts you refer to while using voice recognition.

&gt; Calendar Information. The Customization Service may access your device’s calendar and may collect and analyze your calendar data to learn your preferences, **record special occasions and identify your location**. 

&gt; Internet Browsing History. The Customization Service may **access, collect and analyze your Internet browsing history (such as visited websites, search keywords and bookmarks)** to learn your interests and preferences; to display more relevant search results and provide the most appropriate information in different contexts; and to provide you with other services, as described in this Privacy Notice. Your search history from Internet browsing done in Secret mode (Incognito or Private mode) will not be collected.

&gt; Location Information. The Customization Service may **access, collect and analyze your device’s precise geolocation** and other information related to your location on a regular basis through Bluetooth and WiFi signals, calendar entries and other technologies and data for certain purposes, such as to provide location-related notifications or information you request.

&gt; Samsung Account, My Profile and Samsung Services Data. The Customization Service may **collect and analyze information stored in or associated with your Samsung Account (such as your Samsung Account ID, contact information, name, date of birth, and gender)** and information registered in your My Profile.

&gt; Information Related to Connected Third-Party Apps and Services. By permitting the connection to a third-party app or service, you can enable the Customization Service to utilize the data regarding your usage of these third-party apps and services and to provide you with customized features.

&gt; *How is the collected information used?*

&gt; to provide you with customized content and information;

&gt; • to analyze methods of providing you with better Services;

&gt; • **to display customized advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you**

&gt; • with your separate consent, to communicate with you via email and push notification about products and services offered by Samsung and third parties that are tailored to your interests.

So, as you can see there isn't anything this service offers that requires collecting so much data. Stuff like ""remind me to buy a bottle of water"" does not require collection of my text messages, internet searches, calendar events, etc.

When some of its main features are things like ""Renamed Downloads to Files (again)"" and ""Restricted rootless themes"" - it looks like google is taking a step backwards with this release.

Improved brightness adjuster? Really?  It took 9 versions for them to realize that 50% brightness was actually 90%, and they've only just now made a game-changing ""logarithmic"" update to it?  They've also reportedly ""brought back"" the Recent clear all button.  How is that an appealing reason to upgrade?  Should I be excited about introducing an old feature back into my system?  
Why would I care about the fingerprint registration dialog to have a colorful animation, and why is it advertised as a major feature?  The underlying functionality is the same.  140 new emojis?  Seriously Google, is that the best reason we have to switch to P?

 On my S9+, I use the pixel2 icon pack and a modified pixel launcher I found on XDA.  That's the closest I will ever get to upgrading to P unless more of an incentive is given to update.

Since security updates are rolled out separately, do any other Samsung mobile owners feel the same way? It seems like Google is restricting android and reverting to old features, and this is not a very appealing update (for when it comes).  Will I have an option to decline the P update when it comes, or will this be mandatory?

I use rootless themes to make my notifications appear in darkmode to match the rest of my dark theme.  I don't care much for the UI ""updates"" made in this version and I'm worried I'll be forced to update.

Samsung's Galaxy S9 and Google Pixel 2are especially compelling for those who want the sexiest design and most compelling camera, respectively. But when most friends and family ask me what phone to buy, I tend to recommend the iPhone over Android.

If you’re thinking of buying the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X, know that the A11 Bionic chip inside blows away anything from the Android camp. Not only did this processor pace Apple’s flagship to huge wins in synthetic benchmarks such as Geekbench 4 and 3DMark; it also ran circles around the likes of the Galaxy Note 8 and the Pixel 2 XL when doing things like editing 4K video and opening large files. Even the newer Galaxy S9 is more than twice as slow.

This is going to hurt a little, Android fanboys. One week after launch, iOS 11 was reportedly installed on 25 percent of iOS devices, according to analytics company Mixpanel.

I cannot rent or purchase Infinity War in UHD through Amazon, only 1080P, even though the 4K digital version has been released. 

I cannot rent or purchase Infinity War in UHD through DirecTV Cinema, only 1080P, even though the 4K digital version has been released.  

I COULD rent or purchase Infinity War in UHD through Vudu, which is the only digital streaming service I have found where the 4K digital version is available, but for whatever extraordinarily stupid reason, the Vudu app on my 4K Samsung television does not allow 4K streaming. 

I can stream 4K through literally every other app that offers 4K programming—Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc.—plus my DirecTV is 4K enabled, but not this ridiculous Vudu app.

1. Some people will get texts twice from me. Usually this is once when I send it (Message+ says 'sending') then again after I reboot my phone (Message+ says 'sent') I think this happens primarily, maybe only, with people that have iPhones.  
  
2. I'll click on a notification to open an app and nothing will happen until several minutes later - sometimes when I am in another app.  
  
I recently deleted a bunch of photos from my phone. I'm partially suspicious that Samsung / Android may be doing something similar to what Apple admitted - slowing down older phones or making the battery last not as long with software updates to push people to buy new handsets.

The backstory to my device is that I purchased it 2 months ago brand new through Fido. It was sold to me in store (via a fido rep) under the premise that it was water resistant up to 3 feet. 
Since purchase it has never come into contact with water, not even rain. I live just outside of Toronto, Canada, and while we have had a spell of high humidity weather the past month or 2, I have central air in home and office with an attach dehumidifier on the system. I work indoors mainly and have rarely had this phone outside in the humid weather for long periods.

I recently discovered that my videos were getting a lot of stuttering and lag and even freezing when trying to record. After a lot of digging, and not a lot to go on from the internet, I think I've pinpointed the issue.

I purchased my S9+ through T-Mobile about a month ago upgrading from a Google Pixel. I was mostly after the enhanced camera modes such as 4k (60fps), super slow motion (960fps), and 1080p slow motion (240fps). It worked great for the first few weeks and then one day the 240fps mode started recording very choppy, stuttery video and would even freeze or crash on hitting record. At first I thought it was the new SD card I started using, but removing that didn't fix it. Then I tried the usual troubleshooting tactics such as deleting the camera app cache and data. I even went as far as factory resetting the phone. Nothing worked. 

I finally contacted Tmobile and they sent me a free replacement thinking it was hardware related. Yesterday I picked up my new phone and, voila, it worked. Smooth 240fps video once again. Then last night, my phone auto-updated to latest firmware and once again, I'm stuck with stuttery, laggy 240fps slow motion video. So I had my friend who also has a S9+ through Tmobile test his, and he had the same issue. He is also updated to the latest version of firmware.

At this point I knew it was firmware related, so I dug deeper. I contacted Tmobile again and they suggested I contact Samsung. Samsung stated they hadn't heard about this issue and escalated it to their dev team. I'm assuming since the mode isn't enabled on the camera by default that not a lot of people have experienced this issue. Combined with the fact that a lot of people in general don't use slow motion modes.

I then had another friend with a S9+ but through AT&amp;T test his  and it worked perfectly. After looking at his Baseband version and comparing it to mine, it is the stock version of firmware that ships with the phone and it seems AT&amp;T is further behind on updates than T-Mobile is.

TLDR: Don't upgrade to Baseband version G960USQU2ARF7 if you want 240fps camera mode to work smoothly. This is the July 8th update and is the latest update for T-Mobile and hasn't been released for AT&amp;T

I'm 99% sure this is the issue and Samsung needs to know about it. If anyone else has a S9 or S9+ through T-Mobile and is updated to the latest firmware feel free to comment and confirm that your 240fps slow motion video is also choppy or stuttering. And if you haven't updated, let me know if your video is smooth or not! I kinda hope I'm wrong and am just unlucky with TWO phones.

I enjoyed the phone, the battery was fantastic and I liked all the features. I've always loved the Note line, and I toy with buying one each year. However, I gave the S8+ away and got a Pixel XL 2 because of the camera. However, the main difference here is not the back camera. Although, I believe the Pixel's camera to be superior, I feel all back cameras from major OEMs (Google, Samsung, Apple), are all highly serviceable. However, what sets the camera discussion a part is the front facing camera. 

I personally believe that the Front Facing Camera on Samsung devices are downright putrid. I have no idea why they continue to keep the awful face smoothing feature with phones in the west. I gave the S8+ away because the Pixel 2XL front facing portrait mode was insane to see when I was looking at such an awful front facing camera everytime I used it. Now, I am not some self-absorbed individual who needs to take glamour shots. I truly believe the ""selfie"" cam should be viewed as an extension of the camera experience for any phone. It's just a way of taking pictures in the today's world that is easier sometimes. 

What I am curious about is have they made any upgrades with the Note 9? I totally buy into the package of creating a truly ultimate phone, which I believe Samsung is very close with here. However, no reviewer or online publication has discussed this. Any thoughts on this?",samsung,2018-08-09 20:12:46

I'm also curious if anyone knows if you can pay it in full at any time. Like, if I want to stop financing and just buy it, will I be locked to the 2 year contract?",samsung,2018-08-09 20:29:34
9605xe,"It has been 5 months since I bought the S9 from Samsung direct using their trade-in program. At checkout, I was provided a price of $520 + $39 tax, for total of $559 at checkout (minus $200 for trade-in value). Once I clicked checkout, my card was immediately charged for $709. Quite the change right? My trade-in value had changed on Checkout from $200 to $50. 

After immediately speaking with Samsung regarding the issue, they said it shouldn't be an issue and they were opening a ticket for a refund. 11 days later after not hearing from them, It turns out I have to go ahead and send in my trade-in phone before they can return the extra $150. Okay, no big deal. 

30 days later, No refund for me because ""Device's camera lens is cracked or broken"". They send me potato pictures that show no damage to the lens. I know there was no damage to the lens when I sent it in, and I had taken pictures with it the day before we sent it in. Call in and talk to rep, ""yeah, doesn't look like any damage, we will ask warehouse for re-evaluation.""

20 some days later and the same thing. Camera is broken. Call in and talk to rep, and they claim the obvious flash from their camera taking the pictures is a ""starburst"" on the lens. I ask if I can just return the phone for a full refund. It's after their 15 day refund policy and has to be approved. 15 days later, the refund is approved by one department, but denied because of the trade-in ""Damage"". So I can't return the phone for a refund. 

Try to talk to manager, disconnected after 15 minutes. Call back, request manager, disconnected after 56 minutes.... Call back, wait for manager for over hour. Manager claims there is damage and that I agreed to all this in the terms and conditions. I Argue that I agreed to the terms and conditions at the the price of 520 plus tax, not 670. He says I agreed with terms and conditions and there is nothing else to be done. 

I am now disputing charge with Credit Company and reaching out to Consumer Protection Agency.

961afa,"Hello Reddit,

I carry around the Galaxy Tab S2 8.0"" 4G in my pocket. Girls don't seem to find it fair that guys get large pockets in their pants. Anyway, it is getting annoying now that my USB-C devices outnumber my MicroUSB ones, and I am forever forgetting to carry the correct cables for the old stuff.

The Galaxy Tab S4 has been released and they completely f\*\*ked it - a device in 2018 without fingerprint is a complete joke. Plus, like the Tab S3, it does not come in a ""mini"" format (anything to compete against iPad Mini).

**Does anybody know anything about whether Samsung has plans to return to making premium mini tablets? Or noticed any trends that suggest they might or might not do it?**

*Please do not make sarcastic comments like ""let me check my crystal ball"". I am not asking you to predict the future. Educated guesses and reasonable speculation are all I want here.*

It would be a dream if they made a 8.0"" tablet in 16:9 again, and go all out with specs like in their flagship phones - I would happily use it as a phone, as the Galaxy Note series is undersized and is not getting considerably bigger. This current 37:18 ratio is annoying when using external displays with the USB-C port - it results in letterbox borders. Also, Exynos. I bought the 2015 Tab S2 4G SM-T715Y second hand rather than buying the later Qualcomm Snapdragon version - I have never owned a device that is not Exynos, and I do not plan to break that streak. As far as I can tell, they only use Snapdragon for ancient technology in US and China (CDMA). Anyways, if a hypothetical device was 16:9 it could be slightly thinner than my current tablet and fit in pockets without the bulging, and still dwarf the Galaxy Note handsets. But they simply do not try with tablets. They come without NFC a lot of the time, and the cameras are plain mediocre. They always seem to use old chipsets. The Tab S3 ""fast charging"" seems a lot like somewhere between slow and standard charging for the smartphones - even though it has USB-C and could command as much power from USB-PD as it wanted - hypothetically 100W.

Most of the time, it won't even turn on. Occasionally I get into the download mode warning (I haven't bothered to enter that for some reason), and I USED to be able to get into recovery (I backed up my camera pics with TWRP, most other pics are backed up on onedrive).

I've been trying to get recovery mode again for a couple of days, my mom left me with some important contacts that I ABSOLUTELY have to recover. Otherwise, I'd be ready to factory reset or even sell the phone to upgrade to either the LGv20 or the Oneplus 3^T ^maybe .

But to do that, I obviously need to fix the phone. I'm in my former home country of Morocco atm, so I can't rely on others that much. Although derb ghalef (the centre of information in Morocco, they even have a Samsung shop there(its a very traditionally looking market).

Why am I so hung up? Because pre-order you can get free upgrade to the 512gb model which is a $400 price tag difference! Blah!",samsung,2018-08-11 10:14:16

1.) as someone who has only used the android wear ecosystem, how does Tizen hold up? 

2.) I loath Samsungs email and texting apps so I use googles android messages and blue mail for email, will a Tizan watch still allow me to respond to messages when not using Samsungs app or am I pidgenholed into using Samsungs apps if I want compatibility?

3.) I have Metro PCS for service, currently grandfathered into a plan with no throttling and unlimited data for 2 lines and unlimited tethering.  I am interested in possibly getting a watch with LTE although im, not 100% sold on it yet. largely because of im not sure if compatibility with my network will work with a Tmobile LTE watch. but also because of im not sure how much I will use the functionality. can anyone speak to that in regards to why they recommend or don't recommend the LTE version? 



TL;DR: how does Tizen compare to wear os, using non-Samsung texting apps possible, metro pcs compatibility, and yes or no on LTE.

Hi all 

I am on the market for a new hybrid tablet/laptop that i can take with me while i travel or on the go and not carry my Macbook 15"" laptop. i do basic stuff = also own the iPad Pro- but wanted something a bit more advanced. 

I'm currently trying the new Surface GO and Samsung Tab S4. 

Even though the surface is great as you can do easily everything that a pc can do (not reffering to heavy tasks editing etc) I really don't like its design. It feels old-school and the huge bezels are just not of my preference. Even though it can be a great pc - the lack of apps on tablet mode it's not something i like either. 

i decided to try the new Samsung S4 - I love the screen, how light it is and the overall design - the keyboard is meh though! Now and apologies for the long intro - there is a simple task i try to do and it's been impossible. Through work i donwload several images that i have to stich together into a PDF. They are ordered by numbers and they have to be at a specific order. 

i managed easily to download the zip file and extract it = which is a plus since the iPad needs an extra app for it. I typicall use smallpdf.com a great website all about pdf that i go uplaod the images and convert them to a single PDF - I tried both through the app and Dex mode but the files app won't allow to upload more than one image at once - is that the case? I get another option where i can see the files/images i downloaded and can select all together and upload them but for some reason their order gets mixed up :/ (new to android but this looks close to the google drive interface) 

Now i tried to download several apps that convert images to pdf - but none works properly. Most they don't give an option to go to the files but just to the gallery and one that it does, didn't allow more to select multiple images. 

i also tried to donwload new file manages - but it seems there is no way to change them to the default, so when i try to uplaod on smallpdf I can select all files/images. 

Any thoughts/ideas? - Apologies haven't used Android for a bit. 

Also anyone is using Dex - any tips? can i do split screen on Dex?

Thank you all! ",samsung,2018-08-12 10:32:35

I’ve got a question regarding the Samsung upgrade programme in relation to the Note series of phones.

Just wondering how strict Samsung are about the condition when it comes to sending the phone back to get the latest model in 12 months time? 

I always keep my phones in cases and never drop them but as everyone knows, it’s really hard to get a decent screen protector for these curved screens.

My girlfriends Samsung Galaxy Tab has randomly started having this issue, no idea what she’s done to it but essentially it won’t boot up, just keeps saying “Firmware upgrade encountered an issue. Please select recovery mode in Kies &amp; try again.” 

Well I’d love to do that, but my PC will not recognise the tab at all. I’ve tried different cables and a different machine, it just will not recognise the tab is plugged in. I’ve tried booting in recovery but it won’t respond to any combination of buttons, it just simply shows this screen then turns off again, turns back on to this screen and so on. 

I’m at a total loss with it, I don’t really want to have to buy a new one, or pay someone to have a go at fixing it if it’s something I can do, but I’m totally out of ideas. All the fixes I seem to find on YouTube involve connecting it to Odin and loading an older firmware, but how do I go about this when the PC won’t detect the tab?

I panicked a little here, but then I thought I had it: just plug in an external cable through USB OTG. Unfortunately, the USB port is disabled for everything except charging in MPSM. I panicked a bit more.

My next idea was to try using ADB to enable Samsung Keyboard, but, unfortunately, I didn't have USB Debugging enabled, so this wasn't an option.

At this point I thought that I was doomed to do a factory reset, but I kept Google searching. I eventually found out that there's a feature built in to Samsung phones if you're signed into your Samsung account: [Find My Mobile](https://findmymobile.samsung.com/). If you know your Samsung account password, you can use this feature to remotely disable the password on your phone, which successfully allowed me to disable MPSM and get everything back to normal. 

Thanks, Samsung.

I am interested in preordering the Note 9. I won’t be able to pay the full price for it so I am considering using Samsung Finance (Australia btw).

For those who have used Samsung Finance, did you just have to pay a certain amount each month that you agreed upon? Also noticed that there are monthly fees that must be paid but will be waived if there is no balance owing. Does that mean I would have to pay that fee each month since I have not paid it off yet?

***Open Avast User  Interface***

Click ***Protection*** \&gt; ***Firewall***. you will see under*** recent apps Managed by your Firewal***l that ***""SamsungFlowDeskto***p"" app was blocked.

*Try sending a file like a video again*. You will notice ***a new network*** that will appear below your connected Ethernet/WiFi network.

OR Go to ***Network Profiles*** (click ***Settings*** under ***Current Network***) and change the LAC network adapter **Profile** to **Private**. click **OK** afterwards.

That's it. You're done.

I do not know what happened to my phone, but around 4:30 pm today it was no longer receiving phone calls or sending them out. When I placed the sim card into my work phone, I could easily send and receive calls. The kicker is that my Note 8 can still send and receive text messages, but for some reason it cannot send or receive phone calls (even after a factory reset). The only solution that is left is to mail my phone in. 

Let me start off by saying that I used to love Samsung. I had the note 5 and then I gladly upgraded to the Note 7 and stuck through the recall. However, when I had a screen issue with the Note 8, I was told that I needed to mail it in for repairs. Samsung expects me to mail in my phone for 11 business days without any replacement. 

Fast forward to right now. I have the current problem that I had explained earlier. The first person was very helpful and understanding. He understood the perplexity of the issue that my phone cannot make or receive phone calls. When the phone is turned off it goes straight to voicemail, but when it is turned on it rings 3 times for the person who is calling, but it doesn't ring on the phone that is being called. I called again after placing the sim card in my other phone and it worked. I called back and this time around, the guy told me that I need to buy a new phone. There was no troubleshooting etc. The last guy helped me the most. He logged into my phone remotely and tried diligently for 2 hours to troubleshoot! After no avail and after a factory reset.... it still doesn't work. 

Long story short, I have to mail my phone in for 11 business days with no replacement. Samsung doesn't know what it wrong with my phone. This really sucks for such a quality product that their quality care is so outdated!

93fvs8,"Just got my hands on a S9+ for a decent price and have been messing around with it for a few hours. Going from the iPhone 6 to the S9+ is quite a step change in terms of well everything.. The screen for example makes the old iPhone 6 look like a Gameboy colour! But one of the other big differences is the sheer size of the thing.  

I like to use devices one handed, like when eating it’s good to be able to feed and do stuff on your phone at the same time. But although my hands are big enough to hold the S9+ in one hand and browse the net the issue is going back and forward on web pages.  On iOS you can swipe right  anywhere on the screen and it’ll take you back a page. On Android no such feature seems to exist by default. I’ve downloaded a few gesture apps but they seem to have the gesture bars towards the bottom end of the phone which is the hardest place to get to using one hand... 

So does anyone know if there is an app that allows you to use gestures on the full height of the phone or even a good portion of the middle as that would be a decent compromise?

Thanks for any helpful answers.",samsung,2018-07-31 16:18:48

93g0es,"I just recently got an unlocked S7 edge from an ebay seller as my first real smartphone and I'm finding it fine so far. However, I have a notification about the DM services and checking device status that never goes away. It's not too big an issue and I can live with it, but it would be nice to be able to get rid of it somehow.

From searching around it seems this issue has something to do with Sprint being the phones original provider (I live in Canada and am currently under Rogers). The only sprint apps I can find on my phone are Lookout and Voicemail (unless there is more buried somewhere in the files) which don't seem related to the notification. 

Is there anything I can do to stop this or is my phone just going to have this message forever?",samsung,2018-07-31 16:33:02

I can't really say if it is an issue that has always been there or if it only started happening recently because it only happens with some apps that I only recently installed. Basically there is audio occasional audio distortion when I am using certain apps. It doesn't happen all the time, and I don't think it is a hardware issue because I can reproduce it using both the built in speaker, a bluetooth speaker and headphones. 

I looked around online to find a solution and one place suggested that it may be the fault of an app that I installed and that I should try it on safe mode to see if it happens there. The only issue with that is that I don't have any issues with apps that are accessible with safe mode. Only ones that I downloaded, and even then only 3 of them. Before I start uninstalling apps and testing it out that way, does anyone have any suggestions?

And I bought the 'no S Pen' old Tab A from Staples this week because of the $100 price cut.  I could never rationalize / justify spending top dollar for the latest tablet.  It's a comfort form factor for a couple of games and reading e books, and being online...thats it for me.  The decent battery power is also terrific.  I've got a Note 8 phone that does mist everything really well when I'm on the go. 

Security:

The tablet still gets security patch updates... BUT receives just quarterly security patch updates now, not monthly.  Regardless, I use Bit Defender.

Pro Tip:

I bought the keyboard case made by Infiland off of Amazon, it fits the SM-T580 and SM-T555 for only $26 🇨🇦.  I could not be more pleased. 


I respect those who rather buy the latest and greatest... The bee S4 tablet is awesome, and a new Tab A is almost here... But a tablet is just a 'want' for me, not a need.

Let me start off with the fact that I do believe Samsung makes good products , I own numerous products from soundbars to T.V.s and am typing this on my note 8. 

But ,to have to fight with a company to spend money for 3 weeks  and then have both T.V. and Soundbar come in damaged then be told I have to wait 30 days plus transit time to be able to even get my money back and try again . You have lost your minds Samsung . This absolutely unacceptable. I dont even want a refund I just want the products I ordered undamaged in a timely manner .

94i0tn,"Hello folks!

I'm going to be upgrading my phone in a few days (my contract lets me upgrade once a year) and I've landed on either the Galaxy S9, the Galaxy S9 Plus or potentially the Huawei P20 Pro.

Right now it is leaning towards the Galaxy S9 Plus the most, as it seems to be packing the most features, a pretty decent battery life, and a great camera. The Huawei P20 Pro definitely gets better battery life which I am aware of, but it lacks quite some features I'd like to see, which Samsung has.

Either way, those of you with either the S9 or the S9 Plus, how would you say your phone manages during an ""average"" day? 

Battery life is the one thing I've always had issues with on every phone I have owned, except my latest iPhone 8 Plus, but even that one is starting to disappoint me lately. I'm by no means a super power user, but I do Snapchat quite a lot (which I know takes a lot of battery), but other than that I guess I spend most of my time on Reddit, or just playing around with the phone, nothing too intense. I also listen to music, check social media and stream stuff from time to time. 

If I have a slow day I'll probably do some gaming every now and then. 

But yeah, the reason why I'm asking this is that I'd really like to go back to a smaller form factor for my next phone (so the normal S9 would be perfect), and I would be willing to sacrifice the extra battery life if that ""extra"" isn't too much. But between the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus I definitely get a lot more juice out of mine than my friend does with his normal iPhone 8, and we have very similar use-cases. 

So to make my question a bit more clear - which phone of those two (or maybe three if we include the Huawei P20 Pro as well) do you have, and how well does it hold up during the day? What kind of user are you?",samsung,2018-08-04 09:46:49

Here are some excerpts from Samsung's official website (https://www.samsung.com/us/account/customization-service/):

&gt; *What types of information may the Customization Service collect about you?*

&gt; Device Information. The Customization Service may **collect your device’s unique identification information**, settings information (such as language and lock settings), status information (such as connections with other devices) and other information about your devices. The Customization Service also may check the applications installed or currently running on your device. In addition, the Customization Service may collect information about how, when and for how long you use the devices connected to your Samsung Account, including your usage of the Services and third-party apps and services on the devices (such as a **listing of apps on your devices, music played on your devices, the websites you visit and the searches you make**).

&gt; Music and Photos. The Customization Service may collect and analyze information such as titles, genres, and artists on previously played or saved music and information about your photos, such as the times and locations at which your saved photos were taken.

&gt; Contacts and Communications Data. The Customization Service may **access your contact list and may collect and analyze your incoming/outgoing call and text message history** to provide you with services, such as to determine your relationships with others (e.g., your family and friends), who your most important contacts are, who contacts you most frequently and your preferred contact method; to display information about your important contacts (e.g., missed calls); and to find contacts you refer to while using voice recognition.

&gt; Calendar Information. The Customization Service may access your device’s calendar and may collect and analyze your calendar data to learn your preferences, **record special occasions and identify your location**. 

&gt; Internet Browsing History. The Customization Service may **access, collect and analyze your Internet browsing history (such as visited websites, search keywords and bookmarks)** to learn your interests and preferences; to display more relevant search results and provide the most appropriate information in different contexts; and to provide you with other services, as described in this Privacy Notice. Your search history from Internet browsing done in Secret mode (Incognito or Private mode) will not be collected.

&gt; Location Information. The Customization Service may **access, collect and analyze your device’s precise geolocation** and other information related to your location on a regular basis through Bluetooth and WiFi signals, calendar entries and other technologies and data for certain purposes, such as to provide location-related notifications or information you request.

&gt; Samsung Account, My Profile and Samsung Services Data. The Customization Service may **collect and analyze information stored in or associated with your Samsung Account (such as your Samsung Account ID, contact information, name, date of birth, and gender)** and information registered in your My Profile.

&gt; Information Related to Connected Third-Party Apps and Services. By permitting the connection to a third-party app or service, you can enable the Customization Service to utilize the data regarding your usage of these third-party apps and services and to provide you with customized features.

&gt; *How is the collected information used?*

&gt; to provide you with customized content and information;

&gt; • to analyze methods of providing you with better Services; 

&gt; • to improve and develop the Services; 

&gt; • **to display customized advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you**

&gt; • with your separate consent, to communicate with you via email and push notification about products and services offered by Samsung and third parties that are tailored to your interests.

So, as you can see there isn't anything this service offers that requires collecting so much data. Stuff like ""remind me to buy a bottle of water"" does not require collection of my text messages, internet searches, calendar events, etc.

When some of its main features are things like ""Renamed Downloads to Files (again)"" and ""Restricted rootless themes"" - it looks like google is taking a step backwards with this release.

Improved brightness adjuster? Really?  It took 9 versions for them to realize that 50% brightness was actually 90%, and they've only just now made a game-changing ""logarithmic"" update to it?  They've also reportedly ""brought back"" the Recent clear all button.  How is that an appealing reason to upgrade?  Should I be excited about introducing an old feature back into my system?  
Why would I care about the fingerprint registration dialog to have a colorful animation, and why is it advertised as a major feature?  The underlying functionality is the same.  140 new emojis?  Seriously Google, is that the best reason we have to switch to P?

 On my S9+, I use the pixel2 icon pack and a modified pixel launcher I found on XDA.  That's the closest I will ever get to upgrading to P unless more of an incentive is given to update.

Since security updates are rolled out separately, do any other Samsung mobile owners feel the same way? It seems like Google is restricting android and reverting to old features, and this is not a very appealing update (for when it comes).  Will I have an option to decline the P update when it comes, or will this be mandatory?

I use rootless themes to make my notifications appear in darkmode to match the rest of my dark theme.  I don't care much for the UI ""updates"" made in this version and I'm worried I'll be forced to update.

Samsung's Galaxy S9 and Google Pixel 2are especially compelling for those who want the sexiest design and most compelling camera, respectively. But when most friends and family ask me what phone to buy, I tend to recommend the iPhone over Android.

If you’re thinking of buying the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X, know that the A11 Bionic chip inside blows away anything from the Android camp. Not only did this processor pace Apple’s flagship to huge wins in synthetic benchmarks such as Geekbench 4 and 3DMark; it also ran circles around the likes of the Galaxy Note 8 and the Pixel 2 XL when doing things like editing 4K video and opening large files. Even the newer Galaxy S9 is more than twice as slow.

I cannot rent or purchase Infinity War in UHD through DirecTV Cinema, only 1080P, even though the 4K digital version has been released.  

I COULD rent or purchase Infinity War in UHD through Vudu, which is the only digital streaming service I have found where the 4K digital version is available, but for whatever extraordinarily stupid reason, the Vudu app on my 4K Samsung television does not allow 4K streaming. 

I can stream 4K through literally every other app that offers 4K programming—Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc.—plus my DirecTV is 4K enabled, but not this ridiculous Vudu app.

1. Some people will get texts twice from me. Usually this is once when I send it (Message+ says 'sending') then again after I reboot my phone (Message+ says 'sent') I think this happens primarily, maybe only, with people that have iPhones.  
  
2. I'll click on a notification to open an app and nothing will happen until several minutes later - sometimes when I am in another app.

The backstory to my device is that I purchased it 2 months ago brand new through Fido. It was sold to me in store (via a fido rep) under the premise that it was water resistant up to 3 feet. 
Since purchase it has never come into contact with water, not even rain. I live just outside of Toronto, Canada, and while we have had a spell of high humidity weather the past month or 2, I have central air in home and office with an attach dehumidifier on the system. I work indoors mainly and have rarely had this phone outside in the humid weather for long periods.

I recently discovered that my videos were getting a lot of stuttering and lag and even freezing when trying to record. After a lot of digging, and not a lot to go on from the internet, I think I've pinpointed the issue.

I purchased my S9+ through T-Mobile about a month ago upgrading from a Google Pixel. I was mostly after the enhanced camera modes such as 4k (60fps), super slow motion (960fps), and 1080p slow motion (240fps). It worked great for the first few weeks and then one day the 240fps mode started recording very choppy, stuttery video and would even freeze or crash on hitting record. At first I thought it was the new SD card I started using, but removing that didn't fix it. Then I tried the usual troubleshooting tactics such as deleting the camera app cache and data. I even went as far as factory resetting the phone. Nothing worked. 

I finally contacted Tmobile and they sent me a free replacement thinking it was hardware related. Yesterday I picked up my new phone and, voila, it worked. Smooth 240fps video once again. Then last night, my phone auto-updated to latest firmware and once again, I'm stuck with stuttery, laggy 240fps slow motion video. So I had my friend who also has a S9+ through Tmobile test his, and he had the same issue. He is also updated to the latest version of firmware.

At this point I knew it was firmware related, so I dug deeper. I contacted Tmobile again and they suggested I contact Samsung. Samsung stated they hadn't heard about this issue and escalated it to their dev team. I'm assuming since the mode isn't enabled on the camera by default that not a lot of people have experienced this issue. Combined with the fact that a lot of people in general don't use slow motion modes.

I then had another friend with a S9+ but through AT&amp;T test his  and it worked perfectly. After looking at his Baseband version and comparing it to mine, it is the stock version of firmware that ships with the phone and it seems AT&amp;T is further behind on updates than T-Mobile is.

TLDR: Don't upgrade to Baseband version G960USQU2ARF7 if you want 240fps camera mode to work smoothly. This is the July 8th update and is the latest update for T-Mobile and hasn't been released for AT&amp;T

I'm 99% sure this is the issue and Samsung needs to know about it. If anyone else has a S9 or S9+ through T-Mobile and is updated to the latest firmware feel free to comment and confirm that your 240fps slow motion video is also choppy or stuttering. And if you haven't updated, let me know if your video is smooth or not! I kinda hope I'm wrong and am just unlucky with TWO phones.

I don't think Samsung is serious about wear technology. Galaxy watch doesn't seem that exciting either. Can't wait till we see Pixel watch.",samsung,2018-08-09 19:16:20
95zzlx,"So, a little backstory here. For some odd reason, I've always been drawn to the Samsung line. This is weird coming from someone who loves pure Android. However, Samsung's rich feature set is what initially got me into the Android ecosystem. I am a tad obsessed with phones. Last year, I bought a S8+ coming from a Nexus 6P. I enjoyed the phone, the battery was fantastic and I liked all the features. I've always loved the Note line, and I toy with buying one each year. However, I gave the S8+ away and got a Pixel XL 2 because of the camera. However, the main difference here is not the back camera. Although, I believe the Pixel's camera to be superior, I feel all back cameras from major OEMs (Google, Samsung, Apple), are all highly serviceable. However, what sets the camera discussion a part is the front facing camera. 

I personally believe that the Front Facing Camera on Samsung devices are downright putrid. I have no idea why they continue to keep the awful face smoothing feature with phones in the west. I gave the S8+ away because the Pixel 2XL front facing portrait mode was insane to see when I was looking at such an awful front facing camera everytime I used it. Now, I am not some self-absorbed individual who needs to take glamour shots. I truly believe the ""selfie"" cam should be viewed as an extension of the camera experience for any phone. It's just a way of taking pictures in the today's world that is easier sometimes. 

What I am curious about is have they made any upgrades with the Note 9? I totally buy into the package of creating a truly ultimate phone, which I believe Samsung is very close with here. However, no reviewer or online publication has discussed this. Any thoughts on this?",samsung,2018-08-09 20:12:46

9605xe,"It has been 5 months since I bought the S9 from Samsung direct using their trade-in program. At checkout, I was provided a price of $520 + $39 tax, for total of $559 at checkout (minus $200 for trade-in value). Once I clicked checkout, my card was immediately charged for $709. Quite the change right? My trade-in value had changed on Checkout from $200 to $50. 

After immediately speaking with Samsung regarding the issue, they said it shouldn't be an issue and they were opening a ticket for a refund. 11 days later after not hearing from them, It turns out I have to go ahead and send in my trade-in phone before they can return the extra $150. Okay, no big deal. 

30 days later, No refund for me because ""Device's camera lens is cracked or broken"". They send me potato pictures that show no damage to the lens. I know there was no damage to the lens when I sent it in, and I had taken pictures with it the day before we sent it in. Call in and talk to rep, ""yeah, doesn't look like any damage, we will ask warehouse for re-evaluation.""

20 some days later and the same thing. Camera is broken. Call in and talk to rep, and they claim the obvious flash from their camera taking the pictures is a ""starburst"" on the lens. I ask if I can just return the phone for a full refund. It's after their 15 day refund policy and has to be approved. 15 days later, the refund is approved by one department, but denied because of the trade-in ""Damage"". So I can't return the phone for a refund. 

Try to talk to manager, disconnected after 15 minutes. Call back, request manager, disconnected after 56 minutes.... Call back, wait for manager for over hour. Manager claims there is damage and that I agreed to all this in the terms and conditions. I Argue that I agreed to the terms and conditions at the the price of 520 plus tax, not 670. He says I agreed with terms and conditions and there is nothing else to be done. 

I am now disputing charge with Credit Company and reaching out to Consumer Protection Agency.

961afa,"Hello Reddit,

I carry around the Galaxy Tab S2 8.0"" 4G in my pocket. Girls don't seem to find it fair that guys get large pockets in their pants. Anyway, it is getting annoying now that my USB-C devices outnumber my MicroUSB ones, and I am forever forgetting to carry the correct cables for the old stuff.

The Galaxy Tab S4 has been released and they completely f\*\*ked it - a device in 2018 without fingerprint is a complete joke. Plus, like the Tab S3, it does not come in a ""mini"" format (anything to compete against iPad Mini).

**Does anybody know anything about whether Samsung has plans to return to making premium mini tablets? Or noticed any trends that suggest they might or might not do it?**

*Please do not make sarcastic comments like ""let me check my crystal ball"". I am not asking you to predict the future. Educated guesses and reasonable speculation are all I want here.*

It would be a dream if they made a 8.0"" tablet in 16:9 again, and go all out with specs like in their flagship phones - I would happily use it as a phone, as the Galaxy Note series is undersized and is not getting considerably bigger. This current 37:18 ratio is annoying when using external displays with the USB-C port - it results in letterbox borders. Also, Exynos. I bought the 2015 Tab S2 4G SM-T715Y second hand rather than buying the later Qualcomm Snapdragon version - I have never owned a device that is not Exynos, and I do not plan to break that streak. As far as I can tell, they only use Snapdragon for ancient technology in US and China (CDMA). Anyways, if a hypothetical device was 16:9 it could be slightly thinner than my current tablet and fit in pockets without the bulging, and still dwarf the Galaxy Note handsets. But they simply do not try with tablets. They come without NFC a lot of the time, and the cameras are plain mediocre. They always seem to use old chipsets. The Tab S3 ""fast charging"" seems a lot like somewhere between slow and standard charging for the smartphones - even though it has USB-C and could command as much power from USB-PD as it wanted - hypothetically 100W.

Most of the time, it won't even turn on. Occasionally I get into the download mode warning (I haven't bothered to enter that for some reason), and I USED to be able to get into recovery (I backed up my camera pics with TWRP, most other pics are backed up on onedrive).

I've been trying to get recovery mode again for a couple of days, my mom left me with some important contacts that I ABSOLUTELY have to recover. Otherwise, I'd be ready to factory reset or even sell the phone to upgrade to either the LGv20 or the Oneplus 3^T ^maybe .

But to do that, I obviously need to fix the phone. I'm in my former home country of Morocco atm, so I can't rely on others that much. Although derb ghalef (the centre of information in Morocco, they even have a Samsung shop there(its a very traditionally looking market).

The annoying part is, as a concierge member, I'm not allowed to pre-reorder my new handset at all because I'm required to be present to trade-in my current Samsung handset so that I can get my $350 early upgrade fee waived.

Other than enjoying the perks of getting 50% off repairs (I always break my screens, butter fingers) I'm now seeing not much other use to being a concierge member especially when Samsung gives you the illusion of being ""part of the club"".

1.) as someone who has only used the android wear ecosystem, how does Tizen hold up? 

2.) I loath Samsungs email and texting apps so I use googles android messages and blue mail for email, will a Tizan watch still allow me to respond to messages when not using Samsungs app or am I pidgenholed into using Samsungs apps if I want compatibility?

3.) I have Metro PCS for service, currently grandfathered into a plan with no throttling and unlimited data for 2 lines and unlimited tethering.  I am interested in possibly getting a watch with LTE although im, not 100% sold on it yet. largely because of im not sure if compatibility with my network will work with a Tmobile LTE watch. but also because of im not sure how much I will use the functionality. can anyone speak to that in regards to why they recommend or don't recommend the LTE version? 



TL;DR: how does Tizen compare to wear os, using non-Samsung texting apps possible, metro pcs compatibility, and yes or no on LTE.

Hi all 

I am on the market for a new hybrid tablet/laptop that i can take with me while i travel or on the go and not carry my Macbook 15"" laptop. i do basic stuff = also own the iPad Pro- but wanted something a bit more advanced. 

I'm currently trying the new Surface GO and Samsung Tab S4. 

Even though the surface is great as you can do easily everything that a pc can do (not reffering to heavy tasks editing etc) I really don't like its design. It feels old-school and the huge bezels are just not of my preference. Even though it can be a great pc - the lack of apps on tablet mode it's not something i like either. 

i decided to try the new Samsung S4 - I love the screen, how light it is and the overall design - the keyboard is meh though! Now and apologies for the long intro - there is a simple task i try to do and it's been impossible. Through work i donwload several images that i have to stich together into a PDF. They are ordered by numbers and they have to be at a specific order. 

i managed easily to download the zip file and extract it = which is a plus since the iPad needs an extra app for it. I typicall use smallpdf.com a great website all about pdf that i go uplaod the images and convert them to a single PDF - I tried both through the app and Dex mode but the files app won't allow to upload more than one image at once - is that the case? I get another option where i can see the files/images i downloaded and can select all together and upload them but for some reason their order gets mixed up :/ (new to android but this looks close to the google drive interface) 

Now i tried to download several apps that convert images to pdf - but none works properly. Most they don't give an option to go to the files but just to the gallery and one that it does, didn't allow more to select multiple images. 

i also tried to donwload new file manages - but it seems there is no way to change them to the default, so when i try to uplaod on smallpdf I can select all files/images. 

Any thoughts/ideas? - Apologies haven't used Android for a bit. 

Also anyone is using Dex - any tips? can i do split screen on Dex?

Thank you all! ",samsung,2018-08-12 10:32:35

I’ve got a question regarding the Samsung upgrade programme in relation to the Note series of phones.

Just wondering how strict Samsung are about the condition when it comes to sending the phone back to get the latest model in 12 months time? 

I always keep my phones in cases and never drop them but as everyone knows, it’s really hard to get a decent screen protector for these curved screens.

My girlfriends Samsung Galaxy Tab has randomly started having this issue, no idea what she’s done to it but essentially it won’t boot up, just keeps saying “Firmware upgrade encountered an issue. Please select recovery mode in Kies &amp; try again.” 

Well I’d love to do that, but my PC will not recognise the tab at all. I’ve tried different cables and a different machine, it just will not recognise the tab is plugged in. I’ve tried booting in recovery but it won’t respond to any combination of buttons, it just simply shows this screen then turns off again, turns back on to this screen and so on. 

I’m at a total loss with it, I don’t really want to have to buy a new one, or pay someone to have a go at fixing it if it’s something I can do, but I’m totally out of ideas. All the fixes I seem to find on YouTube involve connecting it to Odin and loading an older firmware, but how do I go about this when the PC won’t detect the tab?

So a little while ago I needed to get some work done, and I knew that Galaxy S9's maximum power saving mode (or what used to be called ultra power saving mode on older Samsung phones) feature would disable my distracting apps without disabling the basic phone functionality, so I turned it on.

However, I was not aware that it also disabled all third party keyboard apps along with all biometrics. That usually wouldn't be a problem, but, unfortunately I had previously disabled Samsung's stock keyboard with [Package Disabler Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.powermanager.batteryaddon), so I couldn't type in my password after I locked my phone. 

I panicked a little here, but then I thought I had it: just plug in an external cable through USB OTG. Unfortunately, the USB port is disabled for everything except charging in MPSM. I panicked a bit more.

My next idea was to try using ADB to enable Samsung Keyboard, but, unfortunately, I didn't have USB Debugging enabled, so this wasn't an option.

At this point I thought that I was doomed to do a factory reset, but I kept Google searching. I eventually found out that there's a feature built in to Samsung phones if you're signed into your Samsung account: [Find My Mobile](https://findmymobile.samsung.com/). If you know your Samsung account password, you can use this feature to remotely disable the password on your phone, which successfully allowed me to disable MPSM and get everything back to normal. 

Thanks, Samsung.

TL;DR: I disabled all keyboard apps and was locked out of my phone in maximum power saving mode, but I got back in by remotely unlocking my phone with Samsung's [Find My Mobile](https://findmymobile.samsung.com/).",samsung,2018-08-13 20:28:07

I am interested in preordering the Note 9. I won’t be able to pay the full price for it so I am considering using Samsung Finance (Australia btw).

For those who have used Samsung Finance, did you just have to pay a certain amount each month that you agreed upon? Also noticed that there are monthly fees that must be paid but will be waived if there is no balance owing. Does that mean I would have to pay that fee each month since I have not paid it off yet?

***Open Avast User  Interface***

97p1n2,"As much as I love Samsung, they do have horrible customer service. I spent the past 4 hours on the phone with Samsung trying to solve an issue, and there is no solution. I every did a factory reset and my phone is still having issues. 

I do not know what happened to my phone, but around 4:30 pm today it was no longer receiving phone calls or sending them out. When I placed the sim card into my work phone, I could easily send and receive calls. The kicker is that my Note 8 can still send and receive text messages, but for some reason it cannot send or receive phone calls (even after a factory reset). The only solution that is left is to mail my phone in. 

Let me start off by saying that I used to love Samsung. I had the note 5 and then I gladly upgraded to the Note 7 and stuck through the recall. However, when I had a screen issue with the Note 8, I was told that I needed to mail it in for repairs. Samsung expects me to mail in my phone for 11 business days without any replacement. 

Fast forward to right now. I have the current problem that I had explained earlier. The first person was very helpful and understanding. He understood the perplexity of the issue that my phone cannot make or receive phone calls. When the phone is turned off it goes straight to voicemail, but when it is turned on it rings 3 times for the person who is calling, but it doesn't ring on the phone that is being called. I called again after placing the sim card in my other phone and it worked. I called back and this time around, the guy told me that I need to buy a new phone. There was no troubleshooting etc. The last guy helped me the most. He logged into my phone remotely and tried diligently for 2 hours to troubleshoot! After no avail and after a factory reset.... it still doesn't work. 

Long story short, I have to mail my phone in for 11 business days with no replacement. Samsung doesn't know what it wrong with my phone. This really sucks for such a quality product that their quality care is so outdated! 

I just had to vent. ",samsung,2018-08-16 03:59:49

But what if you can't keep it between 50%-80% because you want to be able to use the full capacity? Maybe because you are not within reach of a charger or a socket or something..? So does it really make such a huge difference if you keep it maybe between 10 or 15% to 90% or 100%? You can't always only get along with 30% of the capacity or so..
I don't really want to always have to keep an eye on how I charge my phone when to unplug it and when to charge it.. but I also don't want to affect the lifespan of my battery in a bad way.. on my phone you can't replace the battery. And I'm not a person who always switches phones and just buys a new one if the old one has an issue.

The compression is so bad that it distorts geometric shapes such as lines and patterns. I'm not talking about slight loss of quality - some pictures turn out just fine without any loss, while others look absolutely pixelated and like they were taken from a 15 year old phone.

I have read people post here in other places about ""fixes"" such as taking photos with your camera rather than with Instagram's (i always do that, doesn't work) or using photo editing software (tried them all, doesn't work).

I'm sure samsung is aware of this but it seems there is no interest in fixing it. This been happening for a long time now.

No such thing happens to the regular photos in instagram's feed, they are fine when you post them. Does anyone know a real fix or why samsung's most premium line of smartphones does this on the world's most popular photo sharing app?

So I have finally got around to sorting out my address book. I have used Google contacts for years. However I do use the Samsung address book and dialer as the front end.

So one of the things I did today is set up an archive label in Google Contacts. In that app, you can customise the list to only show certain groups. So I've hidden the archive and I now have a much cleaner list of current contacts.

However, in Samsung Contacts, I can see all of my Google labels (on Note 9, one ui) but I can't seem to customise the view.

So I'm back to the normal long list of people.

I have looked everywhere but I can't seem to find a way of only showing specific Google labels.

Does anyone know if this is possible please?

I can't believe a company I stood by for years does this to their customers. I had the Galaxy s4 and upgraded to the Galaxy S7 edge about 2 years ago (which was my first real expensive phone, even though not the newest model of its time, I still paid $600 for it) and its going haywire. I've had the phone for two years. I know someone might suggest buying a less expensive phone in the mean time but I love having a high quality camera to take pictures of my family.

Second time made me lose my wifi function for weeks which resulted in all my data being used up quickly (on a budget now so I only have 2g of data a month). This third time (currently) is making the phone shut off every 20 minutes and losing the option to turn on wifi.

I've been on Team Samsung for about 4 years now. Came from an iPhone and got my first Samsung phone with the Note 7 but then when the recall began, went with the Note 5. I then upgraded to the Note 8.my upgrade period is coming soon.

Where I am torn is the I can get the S10+ for 475 after a trade in with my Note 8 and be unlocked. Where as I can wait and get the Note 10 at the end of the year and wait for a deal. I've been on notes all this time and don't know if I should just bite the bullet on getting the Note 10 or call it good with an S10+.

Hey guys,

**TL;DR:  Can't log in to Family Hub with my Samsung account.  Samsung either unable or unwilling to resolve, and until they do, I can't use most of the features of my new fridge.**

My husband and I recently purchased a brand new Samsung fridge with Family Hub and we royally screwed up the Family Hub feature and need help. Samsung apparently can’t help us, so I’m really hoping somebody here is smart enough to figure out what the issue is and if we can solve it on our own.

Mistake #1: When we went to log in for the first time, we decided to create a new account with our joint email. We realized our mistake pretty quickly, as I have a Samsung account that I’ve had for years and have a pretty well-established profile by now (he’s an avid Apple user). I added myself as a user profile under the new account but couldn’t figure out how to make my profile the “main” account and demote/delete the “ghost” account that we had created. Okay, no problem, I thought…I’ll just do a factory reset.

Mistake #2: Performed factory reset and tried to log in under my email address. I got an error message that my email address was associated with another account and therefore I could not log in. Oh, right…I must need to delete the “ghost” account we had created. No problem. I went online and deleted the account. Tried to log back in…wait. I’m still getting an error message that my email address is tied to another account and therefore I can’t log in. What the hell?

The very first time we called Samsung, the support tech immediately let me know exactly how I screwed up: I should have deleted all profiles associated with the “ghost” account before performing the factory reset/deleting the account. Yep, I understand that now, but that was in no way intuitive to me before the fact, and I need to know how to fix it now that the mistake has been made. Is Samsung seriously telling me there’s no way to fix this problem and I have a $2K+ basic fridge? I can’t use any of the fancy-ass features I splurged for now, all because I didn’t realize I was supposed to manually erase everything before performing a factory reset. Seems like a MASSIVE design flaw on Samsung’s part. Have to say I am not impressed so far, and I wish I had purchased another brand of appliance.

So…it has now been approximately 4 weeks since the events described above. We have called Samsung support every week and put in service tickets and have gotten nowhere. We have tried factory resets numerous times, we have tried recreating the “ghost” account and deleting it again (no surprise…didn’t work), we have been escalated and re-escalated to higher and higher tiers of support within Samsung…I’m not sure anyone knows how to solve our problem, which doesn’t seem complex to me at all. Does anyone have any ideas?",samsung,2019-08-06 03:41:32

The least interesting part of the S10 5G, for me, is the 5G capability; I love the ToF camera, the huge screen, huge battery and just the bigger body size in general. The Note 10+ will have all of these things, with (assumingly) more improvements here and there, and a pen.

I can grab an S10 5G from somewhere like Wonda Mobile or CeX for around £700-800 ($850-975) which considering the RRP is not that bad, at the expense of a proper warranty (although I always purchase insurance). Will it be worth waiting for the Note 10+ to become a bit cheaper? Or until the S10 5G is even cheaper still? 

Would love some insight from any S10 5G users and those waiting out for the Note 10+/anyone who has had the chance to use it already, or anybody for that matter!

Thanks all,",samsung,2019-08-06 17:18:46

But....


Software and support. If we're going to have a lifelong relationship together you gotta step it up! It's like you aren't even trying anymore. I get it in relationships people tend to let them go a little bit but this is too far. Why am I spending $1200+ on the latest phone (s10 plus) to get features and updates after last year's s9? And don't try and blame your mistakes on the carriers. These are both unlocked phones. Why is it that I haven't received a security patch since May but my friend with the s8 was updated this month, and my other friend with the s9 even has night sight update? While I'm just left sanding in the dark?



This is unacceptable. A phone is only as good as it's software and a relationship is only as Good as the effort both parties put in. And you haven't been putting in your part.  Maybe we need some time apart so you can grow a little. Maybe you just aren't mature and responsible enough for a serious relationship. I deserve better then this. And if you won't work on this relationship with me then maybe it's time we take a break.",samsung,2019-08-07 00:14:40

Thing is, finding a case that fits is a nightmare, this phone is still new in Argentina where i live, so i found only two cases, one of them i payed 300 pesos, triple the usual case prices because it was the only one i could find for my exact model, and the other one was a generic 5.5/6 inch one that i payed 100 pesos for, but i had to go to a distributor place and try like 15 different cases until i found this one and it covers the flash part of the camera, so i'm still on the hunt for a flip case to cover the screen while i have it on my backpack for hours while i travel, yesterday i almost found one, it was only 30 pesos (a dream price) but it was scuffed and slightly unglued, so i didn't get it.

Not that impressed. It should really come with a 1440p screen and 12GB of Ram for £900. The screen is still stuck at 60Hz. The OnePlus 7 Pro has 12GB Ram, a 90Hz Screen, 4,000 mAh Battery and a 48 Meg Camera for £800. Just buy that. The OnePlus 7 Pro also looks a lot better with its completely bezel less screen with no stupid Infinity O Cutout.  The Note 10 Plus is a bit better with a bigger 6.8” 1440p Screen, bigger 4,200 Battery, Micro SD Expansion, 512GB Storage option and 5G. Neither of the Notes have headphone jacks and the  phones don’t come with a dongle. The Note line is meant to have a load of features for Pro Users. The Galaxy S10 has a headphone jack. I’d think that they would leave it in after all the crap they gave Apple for removing it. At least include a dongle for it? Samsung use the lame excuse of we wanted to leave room for a bigger battery. If they can fit an entire stylus in there they can definitely drill another small 3.5mn hole in there. They want to make the batteries bigger but if their not careful we’re going to get another Note 7 situation again. They wouldn’t need to make the batteries a while lot bigger if they sorted out their crappy laggy unoptimised Samsung software experience. Rant over.

The plus max outs to 12+512GB variant with micro SD expansion while the regular max outs to 8-256GB with no SD card slot. The display on Note 10 is just 1080p while the plus's maxes to 1440p. The plus has a 45W charger supported and a special Aura Blue colour available and the plus also has a extra depth sensor.

New features are mostly AR focused and the S-Pen has a gyroscope for air navigations.

cnc9ed,"Samsung just unveiled the all new Galaxy Note 10 and showed off their radical new S-Pen design. The design difference with the old note s pen design that has been around since the first Note and the all new note 10 S-Pen design is that the previous s pen was 2 pieces and the new one is all one piece. The old s pen got alot of complaints about the 2nd piece on the top of the s pen, especially on the Note 8 and Note 9 about it breaking in half on that one weak point. There were even reports of the Note 9's s pen being bent out of the box brand new. I have a Note 8, and my s pen bent after normal usage. I had sent multiple suggestions for a new design, of the S-Pen to be all one piece, for rigidity. This new design I believe was based off my design suggestion. This now means that we all don't have to worry about our s pens breaking in half or even being broken out of box. Thank you Samsung! :&gt;",samsung,2019-08-08 05:53:44

cngqht,"This post might be a downvote magnet but let's get on with it.

These days, there are two sides that argue for or against the inclusion of the headphone jack. One side prefers the freedom of having option to use legacy headphones, while the other accepts the reasons provided by smartphone manufacturers and later adapts.

Given how high-end smartphones have saturated the market at the moment, probably only a very compelling and interesting device would push consumers to upgrade. This implies that ""meh"" devices would immediately drown in the sales figure of other more popular ones. 

Using this argument, it appears to me that most consumers of the flagship segment don't really care whether a headphone jack is included or not. They are more into the core features of a smartphone, such as snappy interface, excellent cameras, vibrant screen, etc. SD card expansion is becoming less relevant as well, given how large internal storage of modern flagship (for storing random pics and social media uploads). The same can be said about the headphone jack. Consumers would adapt by purchasing a new bluetooth headphone and leave their wired cans for other devices (or purchasing a dongle).

The so-called ""power users"" who are craving for every single option to be made available to their phones are never in the majority. So, regardless of their opinions, most consumers would still buy new flagships that they are interested in and the current trend we are seeing is probably irreversible by now.

In the case of Note 10, Samsung would need to make a really stupid decision to generate a significant backlash, such as removing the S-Pen from the Note line, which would make no sense even your most average joe. So, I suppose smartphone manufacturers these days are really getting away by removing legacy features, and the only option that you'd have is either to adapt, keep your older device, or find a mid-range alternative (those dubbed ""flagship-killer"").",samsung,2019-08-08 12:39:26

cnj0r0,"**Dear Samsung,** 

I just wanted to say how disappointed I am in you right now. I've had every Galaxy S phone since the S4 (excluding S5), Note 3, and Note 7 (RIP) . I am currently using the S10 as my main phone. However, with this announcement, I don't anticipate buying any more Galaxy phones until you get your act together again.

**1.**  The headphone jack is one of those quality of life things that you don’t realize you miss until they take it away from you. In all fairness, you did keep it for 3 years after Apple ""courageously"" removed it from the iPhone 7 and Motorola removed it from the original moto Z. We all knew it was coming, since you released mid-range phones and some tablets missing the jack, and the leaks of the Note 10 weren't encouraging signs. 

With this change, you lose one of your differentiating features in the smartphone marketplace (only your compatriot LG seems to make flagship phones with headphone jacks these days). I don’t see why the headphone jack should be reserved for mid-range and low-end phones (i.e. Pixel 3a vs. Pixel 3), it should be included on every phone. 

Removing the headphone jack is a pointlessly user-hostile feature, especially to the creatives that you are marketing the phone to, who may want to use it with microphones and other accessories.

When I'm in a pinch, I can go to pretty much any store, and I'll usually find 3.5mm earphones for as low as $5. I have yet to see USB-C/Lightning earphones/adapters in stores. However, some stores are starting to carry wireless earphones in too, but I haven’t seen them less than $20. I don’t see USB-C or Lightning earphones becoming ubiquitous like that any time soon.

I’m not saying that wireless headphones are bad. They’re awfully convenient and can sound decent if you get the right set. But there are still plenty of use cases for the headphone jack. Here’s what I use it for:

* When my Bluetooth earphones die/I forget to charge them or when I want virtually *unlimited* battery life. You are trying to resolve the problem with Wireless PowerShare, but not all Bluetooth headphones support wireless charging yet. Even if they did support wireless charging, wouldn't it be an awful lot faster to just plug some headphones in?
* At my university, there are a lot of Bluetooth devices in close proximity, so sometimes it gets congested and the audio will cut out. A wired connection resolves the problem. 
* On the last flight I went on, they told us to turn off Bluetooth devices. This means that I couldn’t listen to Bluetooth audio until they announced that you could turn on your Bluetooth devices again. Thankfully my S9+ had a headphone jack, so I could start listening to music right away, rather than listen to the person sitting next to me trying to initiate small-talk.
* It might be a placebo, but whenever I use Bluetooth, my headphones sound quieter and less full sounding. When I plug the same headphones into the jack, they sound better and louder.
* Bluetooth earbuds (especially truly wireless ones like your Galaxy Buds inside the charging case) are much more bulky than their wired counterparts. It’s so easy to just slip a pair of 3.5 mm earphones into your pocket and use them when I need them.
* I mainly use Bluetooth audio in my car when I am by myself. But whenever I have friends or family in my car with me, I’ll use a wire so that we can “pass the AUX jack”. It’s a heck of a lot easier than trying to pair everyone’s phones and switch between them in the settings.

**2.** I do like the color choices on the Note 10 line. They are much more visually appealing than your other phones. Other than that, design wise, smartphone aficionados like me can tell them apart, but I showed my mother the Huawei P30 Pro, iPhone XS Max, and Note 10 from the back, she couldn't tell much of a difference. I think the S10 range has a more unique design with the horizontal camera layout. I don't like the location of the Infinity-O cutout. I liked it better on the S10 line since it was out of the way in the corner. I'd rather have a Infinity-U display than the current location of the punch-hole. 

**3.** The Note 10/10+ indicate that you are eschewing your ""kitchen-sink"" philosophy and heading in the footsteps of Apple. In other words, over-charging and under-delivering. The Note 9 was a truly zero compromises, Swiss Army Knife phone. I could name a feature, and it had it. 

The S10 family was along the same philosophy, although you did remove the Iris Scanner and Notification LED. However, the former was substituted with Face Recognition and the improved Fingerprint Scanner, and the latter can be added via software like the Always on Display, Edge Lighting or third party apps. 

Yes, the Note 9 may have started at $999, but the comparable iPhone (XS Max) started at $100 more and lacked many features that the Note 9 had (headphone jack, S-Pen, large battery, etc.). It also had half the storage of the Note 9 (64 vs. 128GB) and the screen on the iPhone was way dimmer and way less vivid. 

I like how you released two sizes of the Note 10 this year, but you should have either decreased the price of the smaller Note 10 and called it Note 10E or gave the smaller Note 10 a 1440p screen and a microSD slot. I think $799 - $849 is a fair price for the smaller Note 10 as it stands, but $949 for a phone with a 1080p screen and no microSD slot is crazy when your competitors' phones and even your other phones have those features. In other words, if I was going to spend $949 on a new phone, I’d rather get the S10E and save a couple hundred bucks. $1,099 for the Note 10+ is ridiculous when the S10+ costs less and has a dual front camera system, unlike the Note 10 family. 

Lots of companies make Android phones. To sell yours, you must do things to differentiate your phones. Lower prices, better screens, unique designs, headphone jacks, expandable storage, faster performance, useful software features (not gimmicks), and actually listening to your customers are just some of the things you could do. Instead, you seem to be trying to fit in with the Apple's and Huawei's of the world. Raising prices and under-delivering will only decrease your profits even further, as fewer and fewer people will be willing to buy your phones, and will look elsewhere. I know I will be.

**4.** Aside from the Note 10, releasing the Galaxy Watch Active in March and then releasing its successor a few months later is not cool, Samsung.

Sincerely, 

An Estranged Samsung Fan.

cnjhhf,"For all you people making a big deal out of the 1080p screen on Note 10, can you actually tell the difference between 1080p and 1440p on this small of a screen? 

I have Note 9 and I just spent some time switching back and forth between 1440p and 1080p and I honestly couldn't tell any difference. 

Don't get me wrong though, I'm a bit disappointed as well (just a teeny tiny bit) and would have preferred 1440p over 1080p even though I can't tell any difference. I know, I'm an illogical greedy human that wants larger numbers for absolutely no reason.

The screen is the only let-down for me. I never used the headphone jack on my Note 9 because I have the Galaxy Buds and even though I have brand new Samsung SD Cards lying around at home, I never actually put them in my Note 9 because the base 256gb storage is more than enough for me. 

I mean, I guess not being able to get that sexy blue color on Note 10 is sort of a let down because let's be honest, that's one sexy color...

I'm probably going to upgrade to Note 10 because the form factor of Note 10 compared to Note 9 is just sooooo much smaller due to industry leading screen to body ratio.

cnkupl,"Since a couple of months I have been planning to upgrade my current phone. Basically any phone would be an upgrade, as I am using an iPhone 6 right now. In the past year it got quite slow and even after changing battery it won't last me a full day. Also when using Spotify and simultaneously browsing the web it starts burning through my hand.

The current and coming iPhones are not an option for me. The price is just ridiculously high for neither getting 5G or USB-C. When spending &gt;1k I plan on using the phone for at least 3-4 years (as with my current iPhone 6).

I have had a look on almost every available phone (I think), and my favourites right now are the S10 and Note 10. The OnePlus 7 Pro is simply too big (and expensive, for not having wireless charging and IP certification). The Huawei software implementation seems to be sub-par.

The remaining phones are the S10 (128GB, \~630€) and the Note 10 (256GB, \~800€). I kind of prefer the Notes design and got a slight bit of hope that the battery life will be a bit better through having the Exynos 9825 instead of 9820. I don't really care about the headphone jack as all of my headphones are bluetooth anyway. UFS 3.0 should be an advantage as well. I don't really need the stylus, but could see myself using it occasionally (I loved it on my Surface 3).

In favor of the S10 is, of course, the lower price (altough lower memory). The display resolution seems to be higher, too, but I read that - at least in default settings - Samsung is downscaling to HD+ anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything considered, what would you choose? Besides these two I am basically open to any suggestions, they should just be &lt;800€, ""one hand managable"" and &gt;128GB (preferably 256GB) internal memory.",samsung,2019-08-08 20:09:11

cnqnna,"The NOTE series has always been steered towards power-users, artists, and creators. It has always offered the best specs, features, and trends that Samsung and Android have had to offer. 

Many people who own Note phones don't use them THAT differently from the average consumer. They make phone calls, send texts, watch videos, etc. To them, the jack may not matter.

But for artists and creators, the evolution of the Note line and its changes DO matter. It WAS a big deal when the Note7 debuted with a curved screen. It looked beautiful and modern but it made usage of the S-Pen a nightmare when reaching the edges/corners. The S-Pen is still annoying to use at the edges of the Note8 or Note9.

For people like me, I use the headphone jack everyday, either when I have forgotten to charge my bluetooth headphones for the gym or when I just want enjoy the better quality sound of the wired headphones. 

Most importantly, I like to connect my digital piano to my phone using the USB-C port and then connect my wired headphones to the 3.5mm jack. Through various music apps, I can play the piano in real-time and I can hear and record on my phone the notes that I'm playing. I can compose new and original music by layering all the notes on top of each other.

This doesn't work with bluetooth headphones because of a very small, but significant latency. In music, timing and rhythm are everything. The notes I hear MUST match the keys I'm pressing. 

I don't want to end up on /r/gatekeeping for implying that you're not a TRUE note fan if you don't do this or that. But please stop telling us that the removal of the headphone jack is no big deal because you've rarely used it. It's the same argument I hear from people who suggest that Samsung should merge the S lines and the Note lines because the phones have gotten too similar and they personally don't use the S-Pen much. If you don't use it, then the phone was clearly not intended for you.

It's always better to have a feature and not need it than to need it and not have it.

I accept the trade-off of a better battery in exchange for the headphone jack, but it doesn't mean that I won't miss it.",samsung,2019-08-09 03:28:12
cnrldv,"I really like the idea of a smaller note 10 but every article that I read people and websites are kicking it down.

Ignoring the head phone jack and SD card, as they don't matter for me, the other sticking factor is the screen resolution. 

Simply being a 1080 screen is not bad. If you put a screen with this resolution into a watch it'll be amazing (and overkill). You need to take into account the clarity of the screen and a good way of doing this is to measure the PPI or pixels per inch.

Below is a list of different phones PPI so that you can see how it compares.


Note 10 403.    
Note 10 + 498.    

Pixel 2 441.    
Pixel 2 XL 538.    

S10 550.    
S10E 438.    
S10+ 552.     

Note 9 519.     
Note 8 514.    
Note 7 409.    

iPhone 6, 7, 8 326.     
iPhone 6+, 7+, 8+ 401.     
iPhone X, XS, XS max 458.     
iPhone XR 326.    

Huawei P20 Pro 408.     
Huawei P30 Pro 398.     

One Plus 6 402.    
One Plus 6T 401.    
One Plus 7 402.    
One Plus 7 Pro 516.    

I understand that with the smaller battery Samsung probably went with a 1080 screen to save battery life. 

I currently have a pixel 2 and this means that my screen quality will get worse. On very rare occasions I look at my screen and feel a little disappointment but I also have a P20 work phone and I think that this screen is fantastic. Likewise we have iPhone 8s in the house and there is nothing wrong with these screens.

I've decided that the screen is not an issue for me.

&gt;     software that is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.

My phone is a computer system, and Bixby is specifically designed to disrupt me and remove any joy I have from the phone. 

It's only a feature if you want it; but I don't. If you don't, it becomes malware. I've disabled everything I can, bixby-related. Removed all permissions where you can (but you can't, since all the bixby-related processes claim they need no permissions... but if you look into it, they don't because they already have permission to do absolutely everything to your phone. I've minimized the Samsung notification that I need to log into their account, and learned to leave with it. I ended up superglue-ing the bixby button so that it won't trigger up accidentally. Still I kept upgrading bixby, in the hope that Samsung will eventually come to their senses and realize that you should have the option to disable any ""feature"" on your phone. 
Well, I was sorely mistaken. I noticed that my phone uses more battery than I expected, so I investigated. Turns out Bixby Voice is waking it up periodically (and, I suspect, it's also the one briefly lighting up the screen for no reason). And of course, you can't do sh*t about it.... not without, hold on, CREATING A SAMSUNG ACCOUNT.

F*ck yyou, Samsung, I don't want to agree to your terms for an account that I don't need or want. You made your message loud and clear: you don't want me as a customer.

Even more improved s pen

12 GB of RAM

256 GB of UFS 3 storage in the base model!!

To test out the samsung website i turned on a Vpn set to hong kong and I looked at the samsung specs and it did not say snapdragon it just described a generic cpu and when i turned the vpn off and refreshed it said snapdragon 855. Does that mean that if i buy it online with a U.S ip adress from samsung website i will get snapdragon 855? if not how can i specify snapdragon if i am buying it somewhere else like Amazon.",samsung,2019-08-09 21:34:53

co32v2,"I don't get what people on the internet want by ranting about the same thing over and over again. Yes, I agree that Note 10 is a weird device that should have been a Note 10e with more affordable pricing, while the Note 10+ could have been the regular Note 10 everyone is waiting for. There was no compelling reason to remove the headphone jack as well as the heart rate and iris scanners. 

But, regardless of how much you'd criticize Samsung, nothing would change unless the Note 10 series flop in term of sales. Regardless, I believe that the people that are unhappy with the Note series are still in the minority so their efforts might as well be wasted. Samsung simply follows the trend of the market; the majority of flagships are released without the Micro-SD slots and headphone jacks anymore, and they are still selling quite well. So, it is reasonable to assume that the majority of the consumers don't even care whether those legacy features are available or not (or they simply adapt to how the situation is).

So, if you dislike the Note 10, don't buy it and vote with your wallet. But please don't make fun of those who are looking forward to their new Note series.",samsung,2019-08-09 22:25:16

But what if you can't keep it between 50%-80% because you want to be able to use the full capacity? Maybe because you are not within reach of a charger or a socket or something..? So does it really make such a huge difference if you keep it maybe between 10 or 15% to 90% or 100%? You can't always only get along with 30% of the capacity or so..
I don't really want to always have to keep an eye on how I charge my phone when to unplug it and when to charge it.. but I also don't want to affect the lifespan of my battery in a bad way.. on my phone you can't replace the battery. And I'm not a person who always switches phones and just buys a new one if the old one has an issue.

•Disabling biometrics.

•Disabling notification reminder.

•Silencing all notifications from google.

•Checked recent notifications in the settings, as well as via a third party app - no app is listed as the culprit of the notification.

•Disabling Bixby.

clhxo5,"Hi all,

So I have finally got around to sorting out my address book. I have used Google contacts for years. However I do use the Samsung address book and dialer as the front end.

So one of the things I did today is set up an archive label in Google Contacts. In that app, you can customise the list to only show certain groups. So I've hidden the archive and I now have a much cleaner list of current contacts.

However, in Samsung Contacts, I can see all of my Google labels (on Note 9, one ui) but I can't seem to customise the view.

So I'm back to the normal long list of people.

I have looked everywhere but I can't seem to find a way of only showing specific Google labels.

Does anyone know if this is possible please?

Thanks.",samsung,2019-08-03 19:54:03

I can't believe a company I stood by for years does this to their customers. I had the Galaxy s4 and upgraded to the Galaxy S7 edge about 2 years ago (which was my first real expensive phone, even though not the newest model of its time, I still paid $600 for it) and its going haywire. I've had the phone for two years. I know someone might suggest buying a less expensive phone in the mean time but I love having a high quality camera to take pictures of my family. It's done this the last three updates. First one resulting in me losing all my contact and pictures (I know I should have synced everything but im not the most tech savy person). Second time made me lose my wifi function for weeks which resulted in all my data being used up quickly (on a budget now so I only have 2g of data a month). This third time (currently) is making the phone shut off every 20 minutes and losing the option to turn on wifi. I'm not asking anyone for anything but I quit a good paying toxic job to be happy, but make less money, and this happens! It's crazy how a multi-million dollar company does this to people for a quick buck.",samsung,2019-08-04 02:17:58

I've been on Team Samsung for about 4 years now. Came from an iPhone and got my first Samsung phone with the Note 7 but then when the recall began, went with the Note 5. I then upgraded to the Note 8.my upgrade period is coming soon.

Where I am torn is the I can get the S10+ for 475 after a trade in with my Note 8 and be unlocked. Where as I can wait and get the Note 10 at the end of the year and wait for a deal. I've been on notes all this time and don't know if I should just bite the bullet on getting the Note 10 or call it good with an S10+.

Hey guys,

**TL;DR:  Can't log in to Family Hub with my Samsung account.  Samsung either unable or unwilling to resolve, and until they do, I can't use most of the features of my new fridge.**

My husband and I recently purchased a brand new Samsung fridge with Family Hub and we royally screwed up the Family Hub feature and need help. Samsung apparently can’t help us, so I’m really hoping somebody here is smart enough to figure out what the issue is and if we can solve it on our own.

Mistake #1: When we went to log in for the first time, we decided to create a new account with our joint email. We realized our mistake pretty quickly, as I have a Samsung account that I’ve had for years and have a pretty well-established profile by now (he’s an avid Apple user). I added myself as a user profile under the new account but couldn’t figure out how to make my profile the “main” account and demote/delete the “ghost” account that we had created. Okay, no problem, I thought…I’ll just do a factory reset.

Mistake #2: Performed factory reset and tried to log in under my email address. I got an error message that my email address was associated with another account and therefore I could not log in. Oh, right…I must need to delete the “ghost” account we had created. No problem. I went online and deleted the account. Tried to log back in…wait. I’m still getting an error message that my email address is tied to another account and therefore I can’t log in. What the hell?

The very first time we called Samsung, the support tech immediately let me know exactly how I screwed up: I should have deleted all profiles associated with the “ghost” account before performing the factory reset/deleting the account. Yep, I understand that now, but that was in no way intuitive to me before the fact, and I need to know how to fix it now that the mistake has been made. Is Samsung seriously telling me there’s no way to fix this problem and I have a $2K+ basic fridge? I can’t use any of the fancy-ass features I splurged for now, all because I didn’t realize I was supposed to manually erase everything before performing a factory reset. Seems like a MASSIVE design flaw on Samsung’s part. Have to say I am not impressed so far, and I wish I had purchased another brand of appliance.

So…it has now been approximately 4 weeks since the events described above. We have called Samsung support every week and put in service tickets and have gotten nowhere. We have tried factory resets numerous times, we have tried recreating the “ghost” account and deleting it again (no surprise…didn’t work), we have been escalated and re-escalated to higher and higher tiers of support within Samsung…I’m not sure anyone knows how to solve our problem, which doesn’t seem complex to me at all. Does anyone have any ideas?",samsung,2019-08-06 03:41:32

But, there's one thing that annoys me and I might not be the only person thinking about it, why won't they make 12"" version and call it Galaxy Tab S6 PRO, a bigger screen for peoples want to work on the go, lightweight, running android save more battery than windows device. I always waited for Samsung to make an actual 12"" Galaxy Tab tablet to compete iPad Pro, I try iPad pro 12"" and it is perfect for work and art creator, it has all the apps like actual photoshop most of all.

Now I signed into the wifi with my account and I want to use a different account. I have already done ""forget this network "" and even done a network reset but my phone still signs me into my previous account that I signed in before. And yes I have disconnected my phone from the account by going onto the login page but it still signs me in. I've tried to login and disconnect from another android tablet just to see of it was not the phones fault and it signs me out.
I'm using Samsung experience 9.5 (android 8.1.0. Yes the android 9 update is out but I don't want to update)
Btw if I reset my phone completely it stops signing me in. And I have searched for it online and didn't get any results.

cmob3u,"Sounds weird, because they're going to be very different devices and one isn't even official yet, but I'm in quite the dilemma...

Currently I have an S10, company provided, which is great as a phone and does almost everything I need, but prior to this I had an S9+ and an S8+, and the decrease in screen size and battery life is really taking its toll on me; having to charge twice a day with 1080p resolution is not fun (I'm a super heavy user).

So here is the situation: I want to purchase a bigger, better Samsung device to use every day for everything I do, and the S10 5G and rumoured/heavily leaked Note 10+ are my two contenders.

The least interesting part of the S10 5G, for me, is the 5G capability; I love the ToF camera, the huge screen, huge battery and just the bigger body size in general. The Note 10+ will have all of these things, with (assumingly) more improvements here and there, and a pen.

I can grab an S10 5G from somewhere like Wonda Mobile or CeX for around £700-800 ($850-975) which considering the RRP is not that bad, at the expense of a proper warranty (although I always purchase insurance). Will it be worth waiting for the Note 10+ to become a bit cheaper? Or until the S10 5G is even cheaper still? 

Would love some insight from any S10 5G users and those waiting out for the Note 10+/anyone who has had the chance to use it already, or anybody for that matter!

Thanks all,",samsung,2019-08-06 17:18:46

But....


Software and support. If we're going to have a lifelong relationship together you gotta step it up! It's like you aren't even trying anymore. I get it in relationships people tend to let them go a little bit but this is too far. Why am I spending $1200+ on the latest phone (s10 plus) to get features and updates after last year's s9? And don't try and blame your mistakes on the carriers. These are both unlocked phones. Why is it that I haven't received a security patch since May but my friend with the s8 was updated this month, and my other friend with the s9 even has night sight update? While I'm just left sanding in the dark?



This is unacceptable. A phone is only as good as it's software and a relationship is only as Good as the effort both parties put in. And you haven't been putting in your part.  Maybe we need some time apart so you can grow a little. Maybe you just aren't mature and responsible enough for a serious relationship. I deserve better then this. And if you won't work on this relationship with me then maybe it's time we take a break.",samsung,2019-08-07 00:14:40

Thing is, finding a case that fits is a nightmare, this phone is still new in Argentina where i live, so i found only two cases, one of them i payed 300 pesos, triple the usual case prices because it was the only one i could find for my exact model, and the other one was a generic 5.5/6 inch one that i payed 100 pesos for, but i had to go to a distributor place and try like 15 different cases until i found this one and it covers the flash part of the camera, so i'm still on the hunt for a flip case to cover the screen while i have it on my backpack for hours while i travel, yesterday i almost found one, it was only 30 pesos (a dream price) but it was scuffed and slightly unglued, so i didn't get it.  


Basically i need to know if anyone knows what phone case could fit my a10, (back in the day with my p8 lite i was using a flip case made for an Honor something something, and it fit perfectly)  


If anyone could give me info or any tips, it would be more than welcome :)",samsung,2019-08-08 05:13:15

cnby3t,"The Galaxy Note 10 has been announced. 6.3” 1080p screen, Snapdragon 855, 8GB Ram, 256GB, Triple Camera, 3400 mAh Battery for £900. 
Not that impressed. It should really come with a 1440p screen and 12GB of Ram for £900. The screen is still stuck at 60Hz. The OnePlus 7 Pro has 12GB Ram, a 90Hz Screen, 4,000 mAh Battery and a 48 Meg Camera for £800. Just buy that. The OnePlus 7 Pro also looks a lot better with its completely bezel less screen with no stupid Infinity O Cutout.  The Note 10 Plus is a bit better with a bigger 6.8” 1440p Screen, bigger 4,200 Battery, Micro SD Expansion, 512GB Storage option and 5G. Neither of the Notes have headphone jacks and the  phones don’t come with a dongle. The Note line is meant to have a load of features for Pro Users. The Galaxy S10 has a headphone jack. I’d think that they would leave it in after all the crap they gave Apple for removing it. At least include a dongle for it? Samsung use the lame excuse of we wanted to leave room for a bigger battery. If they can fit an entire stylus in there they can definitely drill another small 3.5mn hole in there. They want to make the batteries bigger but if their not careful we’re going to get another Note 7 situation again. They wouldn’t need to make the batteries a while lot bigger if they sorted out their crappy laggy unoptimised Samsung software experience. Rant over.

The design difference with the old note s pen design that has been around since the first Note and the all new note 10 S-Pen design is that the previous s pen was 2 pieces and the new one is all one piece. The old s pen got alot of complaints about the 2nd piece on the top of the s pen, especially on the Note 8 and Note 9 about it breaking in half on that one weak point. There were even reports of the Note 9's s pen being bent out of the box brand new. I have a Note 8, and my s pen bent after normal usage. I had sent multiple suggestions for a new design, of the S-Pen to be all one piece, for rigidity. This new design I believe was based off my design suggestion.

These days, there are two sides that argue for or against the inclusion of the headphone jack. One side prefers the freedom of having option to use legacy headphones, while the other accepts the reasons provided by smartphone manufacturers and later adapts.

Given how high-end smartphones have saturated the market at the moment, probably only a very compelling and interesting device would push consumers to upgrade. This implies that ""meh"" devices would immediately drown in the sales figure of other more popular ones. 

Using this argument, it appears to me that most consumers of the flagship segment don't really care whether a headphone jack is included or not. They are more into the core features of a smartphone, such as snappy interface, excellent cameras, vibrant screen, etc. SD card expansion is becoming less relevant as well, given how large internal storage of modern flagship (for storing random pics and social media uploads). The same can be said about the headphone jack. Consumers would adapt by purchasing a new bluetooth headphone and leave their wired cans for other devices (or purchasing a dongle).

The so-called ""power users"" who are craving for every single option to be made available to their phones are never in the majority. So, regardless of their opinions, most consumers would still buy new flagships that they are interested in and the current trend we are seeing is probably irreversible by now.

In the case of Note 10, Samsung would need to make a really stupid decision to generate a significant backlash, such as removing the S-Pen from the Note line, which would make no sense even your most average joe. So, I suppose smartphone manufacturers these days are really getting away by removing legacy features, and the only option that you'd have is either to adapt, keep your older device, or find a mid-range alternative (those dubbed ""flagship-killer"").",samsung,2019-08-08 12:39:26

cnj0r0,"**Dear Samsung,** 

I just wanted to say how disappointed I am in you right now. I've had every Galaxy S phone since the S4 (excluding S5), Note 3, and Note 7 (RIP) . I am currently using the S10 as my main phone. However, with this announcement, I don't anticipate buying any more Galaxy phones until you get your act together again.

**1.**  The headphone jack is one of those quality of life things that you don’t realize you miss until they take it away from you. In all fairness, you did keep it for 3 years after Apple ""courageously"" removed it from the iPhone 7 and Motorola removed it from the original moto Z. We all knew it was coming, since you released mid-range phones and some tablets missing the jack, and the leaks of the Note 10 weren't encouraging signs. 

With this change, you lose one of your differentiating features in the smartphone marketplace (only your compatriot LG seems to make flagship phones with headphone jacks these days). I don’t see why the headphone jack should be reserved for mid-range and low-end phones (i.e. Pixel 3a vs. Pixel 3), it should be included on every phone. 

Removing the headphone jack is a pointlessly user-hostile feature, especially to the creatives that you are marketing the phone to, who may want to use it with microphones and other accessories.

When I'm in a pinch, I can go to pretty much any store, and I'll usually find 3.5mm earphones for as low as $5. I have yet to see USB-C/Lightning earphones/adapters in stores. However, some stores are starting to carry wireless earphones in too, but I haven’t seen them less than $20. I don’t see USB-C or Lightning earphones becoming ubiquitous like that any time soon.

I’m not saying that wireless headphones are bad. They’re awfully convenient and can sound decent if you get the right set. But there are still plenty of use cases for the headphone jack. Here’s what I use it for:

* When my Bluetooth earphones die/I forget to charge them or when I want virtually *unlimited* battery life. You are trying to resolve the problem with Wireless PowerShare, but not all Bluetooth headphones support wireless charging yet. Even if they did support wireless charging, wouldn't it be an awful lot faster to just plug some headphones in?
* At my university, there are a lot of Bluetooth devices in close proximity, so sometimes it gets congested and the audio will cut out. A wired connection resolves the problem. 
* On the last flight I went on, they told us to turn off Bluetooth devices. This means that I couldn’t listen to Bluetooth audio until they announced that you could turn on your Bluetooth devices again. Thankfully my S9+ had a headphone jack, so I could start listening to music right away, rather than listen to the person sitting next to me trying to initiate small-talk.
* It might be a placebo, but whenever I use Bluetooth, my headphones sound quieter and less full sounding. When I plug the same headphones into the jack, they sound better and louder.
* Bluetooth earbuds (especially truly wireless ones like your Galaxy Buds inside the charging case) are much more bulky than their wired counterparts. It’s so easy to just slip a pair of 3.5 mm earphones into your pocket and use them when I need them.
* I mainly use Bluetooth audio in my car when I am by myself. But whenever I have friends or family in my car with me, I’ll use a wire so that we can “pass the AUX jack”. It’s a heck of a lot easier than trying to pair everyone’s phones and switch between them in the settings.

**2.** I do like the color choices on the Note 10 line. They are much more visually appealing than your other phones. Other than that, design wise, smartphone aficionados like me can tell them apart, but I showed my mother the Huawei P30 Pro, iPhone XS Max, and Note 10 from the back, she couldn't tell much of a difference. I think the S10 range has a more unique design with the horizontal camera layout. I don't like the location of the Infinity-O cutout. I liked it better on the S10 line since it was out of the way in the corner. I'd rather have a Infinity-U display than the current location of the punch-hole. 

**3.** The Note 10/10+ indicate that you are eschewing your ""kitchen-sink"" philosophy and heading in the footsteps of Apple. In other words, over-charging and under-delivering. The Note 9 was a truly zero compromises, Swiss Army Knife phone. I could name a feature, and it had it. 

The S10 family was along the same philosophy, although you did remove the Iris Scanner and Notification LED. However, the former was substituted with Face Recognition and the improved Fingerprint Scanner, and the latter can be added via software like the Always on Display, Edge Lighting or third party apps. 

Yes, the Note 9 may have started at $999, but the comparable iPhone (XS Max) started at $100 more and lacked many features that the Note 9 had (headphone jack, S-Pen, large battery, etc.). It also had half the storage of the Note 9 (64 vs. 128GB) and the screen on the iPhone was way dimmer and way less vivid. 

I like how you released two sizes of the Note 10 this year, but you should have either decreased the price of the smaller Note 10 and called it Note 10E or gave the smaller Note 10 a 1440p screen and a microSD slot. I think $799 - $849 is a fair price for the smaller Note 10 as it stands, but $949 for a phone with a 1080p screen and no microSD slot is crazy when your competitors' phones and even your other phones have those features. In other words, if I was going to spend $949 on a new phone, I’d rather get the S10E and save a couple hundred bucks. $1,099 for the Note 10+ is ridiculous when the S10+ costs less and has a dual front camera system, unlike the Note 10 family. 

Lots of companies make Android phones. To sell yours, you must do things to differentiate your phones. Lower prices, better screens, unique designs, headphone jacks, expandable storage, faster performance, useful software features (not gimmicks), and actually listening to your customers are just some of the things you could do. Instead, you seem to be trying to fit in with the Apple's and Huawei's of the world. Raising prices and under-delivering will only decrease your profits even further, as fewer and fewer people will be willing to buy your phones, and will look elsewhere. I know I will be.

**4.** Aside from the Note 10, releasing the Galaxy Watch Active in March and then releasing its successor a few months later is not cool, Samsung.

An Estranged Samsung Fan.

**TL;DR:** I am not a fan of removing the headphone jack, the Note 10’s cookie-cutter design, the abandonment of the “kitchen-sink” philosophy, and the release of the Galaxy Watch Active 2 after the Galaxy Watch Active was announced less than a year ago.",samsung,2019-08-08 16:55:59

cnjhhf,"For all you people making a big deal out of the 1080p screen on Note 10, can you actually tell the difference between 1080p and 1440p on this small of a screen? 

I have Note 9 and I just spent some time switching back and forth between 1440p and 1080p and I honestly couldn't tell any difference. 

Don't get me wrong though, I'm a bit disappointed as well (just a teeny tiny bit) and would have preferred 1440p over 1080p even though I can't tell any difference. I know, I'm an illogical greedy human that wants larger numbers for absolutely no reason.

The screen is the only let-down for me. I never used the headphone jack on my Note 9 because I have the Galaxy Buds and even though I have brand new Samsung SD Cards lying around at home, I never actually put them in my Note 9 because the base 256gb storage is more than enough for me. 

I mean, I guess not being able to get that sexy blue color on Note 10 is sort of a let down because let's be honest, that's one sexy color...

I'm probably going to upgrade to Note 10 because the form factor of Note 10 compared to Note 9 is just sooooo much smaller due to industry leading screen to body ratio. I also much prefer the small camera cut-out compared to the huge chin and forehead on Note 9. The design overall is really sexy as well!",samsung,2019-08-08 17:49:37

cnkupl,"Since a couple of months I have been planning to upgrade my current phone. Basically any phone would be an upgrade, as I am using an iPhone 6 right now. In the past year it got quite slow and even after changing battery it won't last me a full day. Also when using Spotify and simultaneously browsing the web it starts burning through my hand.

The current and coming iPhones are not an option for me. The price is just ridiculously high for neither getting 5G or USB-C. When spending &gt;1k I plan on using the phone for at least 3-4 years (as with my current iPhone 6).

I have had a look on almost every available phone (I think), and my favourites right now are the S10 and Note 10. The OnePlus 7 Pro is simply too big (and expensive, for not having wireless charging and IP certification). The Huawei software implementation seems to be sub-par.

The remaining phones are the S10 (128GB, \~630€) and the Note 10 (256GB, \~800€). I kind of prefer the Notes design and got a slight bit of hope that the battery life will be a bit better through having the Exynos 9825 instead of 9820. I don't really care about the headphone jack as all of my headphones are bluetooth anyway. UFS 3.0 should be an advantage as well. I don't really need the stylus, but could see myself using it occasionally (I loved it on my Surface 3).

In favor of the S10 is, of course, the lower price (altough lower memory). The display resolution seems to be higher, too, but I read that - at least in default settings - Samsung is downscaling to HD+ anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything considered, what would you choose? Besides these two I am basically open to any suggestions, they should just be &lt;800€, ""one hand managable"" and &gt;128GB (preferably 256GB) internal memory.",samsung,2019-08-08 20:09:11

cnqnna,"The NOTE series has always been steered towards power-users, artists, and creators. It has always offered the best specs, features, and trends that Samsung and Android have had to offer. 

Many people who own Note phones don't use them THAT differently from the average consumer. They make phone calls, send texts, watch videos, etc. To them, the jack may not matter.

But for artists and creators, the evolution of the Note line and its changes DO matter. It WAS a big deal when the Note7 debuted with a curved screen. It looked beautiful and modern but it made usage of the S-Pen a nightmare when reaching the edges/corners. The S-Pen is still annoying to use at the edges of the Note8 or Note9.

For people like me, I use the headphone jack everyday, either when I have forgotten to charge my bluetooth headphones for the gym or when I just want enjoy the better quality sound of the wired headphones. 

Most importantly, I like to connect my digital piano to my phone using the USB-C port and then connect my wired headphones to the 3.5mm jack. Through various music apps, I can play the piano in real-time and I can hear and record on my phone the notes that I'm playing. I can compose new and original music by layering all the notes on top of each other.

This doesn't work with bluetooth headphones because of a very small, but significant latency. In music, timing and rhythm are everything. The notes I hear MUST match the keys I'm pressing. 

I don't want to end up on /r/gatekeeping for implying that you're not a TRUE note fan if you don't do this or that. But please stop telling us that the removal of the headphone jack is no big deal because you've rarely used it. It's the same argument I hear from people who suggest that Samsung should merge the S lines and the Note lines because the phones have gotten too similar and they personally don't use the S-Pen much. If you don't use it, then the phone was clearly not intended for you.

It's always better to have a feature and not need it than to need it and not have it.

I accept the trade-off of a better battery in exchange for the headphone jack, but it doesn't mean that I won't miss it.",samsung,2019-08-09 03:28:12
cnrldv,"I really like the idea of a smaller note 10 but every article that I read people and websites are kicking it down.

Ignoring the head phone jack and SD card, as they don't matter for me, the other sticking factor is the screen resolution. 

Simply being a 1080 screen is not bad. If you put a screen with this resolution into a watch it'll be amazing (and overkill). You need to take into account the clarity of the screen and a good way of doing this is to measure the PPI or pixels per inch.

Below is a list of different phones PPI so that you can see how it compares.


Note 10 403.    
Note 10 + 498.    

Pixel 2 441.

S10E 438.    
S10+ 552.

One Plus 6T 401.    
One Plus 7 402.    
One Plus 7 Pro 516.    

I understand that with the smaller battery Samsung probably went with a 1080 screen to save battery life. 

I currently have a pixel 2 and this means that my screen quality will get worse. On very rare occasions I look at my screen and feel a little disappointment but I also have a P20 work phone and I think that this screen is fantastic. Likewise we have iPhone 8s in the house and there is nothing wrong with these screens.

&gt;     software that is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.

My phone is a computer system, and Bixby is specifically designed to disrupt me and remove any joy I have from the phone. 

It's only a feature if you want it; but I don't. If you don't, it becomes malware. I've disabled everything I can, bixby-related. Removed all permissions where you can (but you can't, since all the bixby-related processes claim they need no permissions... but if you look into it, they don't because they already have permission to do absolutely everything to your phone. I've minimized the Samsung notification that I need to log into their account, and learned to leave with it. I ended up superglue-ing the bixby button so that it won't trigger up accidentally. Still I kept upgrading bixby, in the hope that Samsung will eventually come to their senses and realize that you should have the option to disable any ""feature"" on your phone. 
Well, I was sorely mistaken. I noticed that my phone uses more battery than I expected, so I investigated. Turns out Bixby Voice is waking it up periodically (and, I suspect, it's also the one briefly lighting up the screen for no reason). And of course, you can't do sh*t about it.... not without, hold on, CREATING A SAMSUNG ACCOUNT.

I will admit that it is now just a improved ultimate edition S10, but the same can be said for the note 7/8/9 as well. They are saving the massive changes for the S line, and the note comes later with a bump in specs. 

Not sure what people where expecting but this thing seems awesome to me, and my wet dream of a phone if you asked me last year. 

I agree that the price is high, but no one pays retail for it. Through some maneuvers I am making I will get the note 10+ for $800 with $200 in free accessories. Many people will get them BOGO or wait a few months for great sales. 

I don't get the hate.",samsung,2019-08-09 14:31:08

It's likely a good thing for me as I don't feel I'm missing out by waiting a bit longer now.",samsung,2019-08-09 18:13:45

## [How the Samsung Unpacked Event 2019 Unfolded](http://blog.thinkwik.com/samsung-note-10-unveiled-at-the-unpacked-event-2019/)

Samsung Galaxy Note 10 was unveiled by Samsung President and CEO, DJ Koh who pointed out that it denotes the company’s vision and puts more focus on connectivity, creativity, and security. Note 10 is designed for the new generation to enhance mobile productivity. At a time when the line between work and play is becoming increasingly thin, the 8 mm Note 10 unveiled during the Samsung unpacked event is no doubt a powerhouse. It improves on the impressive performance of the previous Note 9 and integrates user preferences.",samsung,2019-08-09 18:33:12

It gave UFS3.0 to OnePlus
Give the 90Hz 2K screen to OnePlus
Give the waterfall screen to Huawei, vivo
Give 64MP to Redmi, realme
Give 108MP to Xiaomi
But the Note10 uses a 12MP, FHD screen. What a great dedication！",samsung,2019-08-09 20:25:11

I can find it cheap on Amazon but those look untrustworthy based on the reviews and how they received a different carrier phone.

I'm switching to Tmobile soon, but they've removed the Note 9 from their website?",samsung,2019-08-09 21:32:24
co2gc1," I live in the united states and I was searching on amazon for "" Samsung galaxy s10 "" and alot of the lower price versions with model numbers ending in F i think in the reviews said they are exynos not snapdragon. To test out the samsung website i turned on a Vpn set to hong kong and I looked at the samsung specs and it did not say snapdragon it just described a generic cpu and when i turned the vpn off and refreshed it said snapdragon 855. Does that mean that if i buy it online with a U.S ip adress from samsung website i will get snapdragon 855? if not how can i specify snapdragon if i am buying it somewhere else like Amazon.",samsung,2019-08-09 21:34:53

co32v2,"I don't get what people on the internet want by ranting about the same thing over and over again. Yes, I agree that Note 10 is a weird device that should have been a Note 10e with more affordable pricing, while the Note 10+ could have been the regular Note 10 everyone is waiting for. There was no compelling reason to remove the headphone jack as well as the heart rate and iris scanners. 

But, regardless of how much you'd criticize Samsung, nothing would change unless the Note 10 series flop in term of sales. Regardless, I believe that the people that are unhappy with the Note series are still in the minority so their efforts might as well be wasted. Samsung simply follows the trend of the market; the majority of flagships are released without the Micro-SD slots and headphone jacks anymore, and they are still selling quite well. So, it is reasonable to assume that the majority of the consumers don't even care whether those legacy features are available or not (or they simply adapt to how the situation is).

So, if you dislike the Note 10, don't buy it and vote with your wallet. But please don't make fun of those who are looking forward to their new Note series.",samsung,2019-08-09 22:25:16
co398p,"So I currently have the Note 8 and am intrigued by the Note 10+ features (SD card, size, etc.) with the exception of the missing headphone jack. I don't really us it anymore, but it is a nice back up in case of some dead BT headphones. I'm just curious what some of you think or if you have any other suggestions. Definitely hating the irony of a lot of what Samsung is doing such as the ads coming down and the like. Appreciate the help!",samsung,2019-08-09 22:39:04

dbewaq,"Hi Everyone, looking for  little advice, I've only ever had Apple smartphones starting with an I Phone 5 and now with a 11 Pro Max and every I Phone in between.

I don't intend to switch away from Apple but have often thought I might like to try an Android phone just to try the different experience.

As a technology lover I'm really excited about the Galaxy Note 10 Plus as it's so radically different from the i Phones that I'm used to, that's the phone I'm thinking of getting. My logic is that I'll then have at the Flagship phone from both brands.

I totally get that this a very extravagant proposal but if I can afford it why not, I just see it as a new toy to play with.

The intended use for the Samsung will mainly be for travel, I travel quite a lot. Unlike the I Phone which has my entire life on it, including Bank Accounts and Credit cards on Apple pay etc I would only load Social media apps, E Mail, Maps, Netflix etc on the Samsung. The other main use would be the camera.

This way I won't have to worry too much about having different information on the two phones as the I Phone will remain my main phone.

So I have three questions,

Anyone out there running both operating systems and how do you find it?

How easy would it be to move photos/videos from the Samsung to my i Phone/I Pad/Macbook

Where do I go if I need support(with Apple its obviously the Apple Store)

Thanks for your comments in advance",samsung,2019-09-30 09:21:55

I was puzzled this evening because a video seemed darker than I expected, it being AMOLED and all.. checked with black squares when I got home, the old LCD phone can show one of them brighter than the brand new AMOLED device regardless of whether adaptive brightness is on or off.  
But here is where it gets interesting.. with adaptive brightness OFF, I shined a flashlight at the phone and then the squares started lighting up much brighter than the LCD. The device is STILL adjusting the brightness to what it thinks it should be, with adaptive turned to OFF!

dc03dx,"I downloaded a [fan-made anthology](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/clp3ll/super_smash_bros_anthology_complete_enhanced/) of video game music, with 35 ""volumes"" that each serve as independent albums, and are tagged as such. However, each volume features many different songs with different album art. When I connected my Samsung S7 to my PC (Windows 8.1) and copy+pasted all of the music to my phone, the albums do not display the correct cover art in the stock music player. The cover of the album itself appears to display a random cover of one of the songs in the album, and every song displays that same cover instead of what it SHOULD be displaying.

Example: Songs 1, 2, and 3 are all in ""Volume 5"" but they all have different cover art. I copy all 3 songs to my phone and I open the default Samsung Music Player. The cover of Song 2 displays on the album and for all 3 songs, overwriting the proper covers for songs 1 and 3.

Obviously proper albums contain the same cover art for all songs included, but this seems like such a silly problem to have on any music player. The problem is also present on Spotify as well. The only place where it displays the proper album art is in the Windows Media Player, and even then, the album cover appears random and you can't change it without overwriting the covers of every single song in the volume.

Anyone else hyped about this? I recently across mention of this ultra portable upcoming laptop and I think it could potentially be game changing, at least for me. 

I never really thought about it much but, by far the two biggest bottlenecks in my laptop usage are having to lug around my battery charger and making sure I'm some place with wi-fi. I don't think it can be overestimated how much more user-friendly not having to worry about either of these things will make using a laptop for the basic user. The new Snapdragon 8cx is supposedly going to go a long way to solving previous windows on ARM issues. And since I don't game on my laptop and just use it for school/work/programming I feel like this will be the definition of a perfect fit for me, and probably a lot of the mainstream public that doesn't have a heavy processing power requirement for their laptop use case.

Either way, I'm pretty hyped to see this come out and even just about the trend it represents for where laptops are headed in the future.",samsung,2019-10-02 12:09:42

This seems to be a pretty large issue that I've found through Google and there's still no fix? So my partner has a Note 8. Hasn't been rooted or nothing, still as is from the shop. The Bluetooth to her car worked for around a few months when car was new. Car is a Kia Cerato 2018, nothing been changed to this either. Bluetooth works fine on all other phones connected, my s10+, MIL iPhone 8.
So I sort of gave up with this BT issue....until I went out and bought my partner a pair of galaxy buds a few weekends back. I said to her, great..this will solve the no talking in car issue we have.

How wrong I was....no calls working through the buds either. Tf? Music, audio books, is all fine. Calls....no go. Whats the point of spending all that money on a new phone at the time only to have quite a large BT issue arise, and still no fix? This is beyond a joke now that we have a pair of buds that are just a paper weight when it comes to a call?
Sorry for the rant but this isn't exactly encouraging for any newer phones from samsung that may have issues come up...what's their hope of a fix when this is still ongoing?

I loved the battery (but that's because i came from an iPhone SE), but now I've realized it's actually terrible. I'm 100% done, the battery has been garbage, and I've had endless problems like not being able to disable that stupid fucking warning message any time I felt like listening to my music on full blast. I'm sick of the random laggy stutters, I'm sick of not being able to receive videos from friends with an iphone over text messaging because the video turns into 144p, I'm sick of how the animations dont feel smooth no matter how much I try to make them feel smooth, from goodlock to window animations, etc. I'm sick of having to rotate the end of my charger until it decides to fast charge instead of slow charge, I'm tired of the lack of brightness outside even with auto brightness enabled, I'm sick of it all. I almost never had problems with my iphone. Sure its bland and boring as shit and theres a lack of android's unfathomable ability to be customized, but I think I'm just going to go back to silly smooth animations, no stuttering, imessage, facetime, etc. Android is fucking fantastic in it's own way, but I'm not willing to deal with the areas it performs poorly in. And honestly I used to constantly make fun of iPhone battery but the iphone 11 max has better battery than any relevant android out right now which impresses me immensely. I'm prepared for the downvotes because I've criticized android in an android subreddit which will yield downvotes and toxic replies but I'm willing to swim through the replies and see if ANYONE agrees with me.

I'm currently on the Note 8 and have no issues with it. A couple of days before the warranty expires. I have changed the charging port and the battery and at some point I had some burn-ins. Sammy reps were nice enough to change the screen and the back panel and the battery again, so it looks brand new with no scratches whatsoever.
BUT
My gf got herself an S10+ and thinks I should get the Note 10+ as well.
I went to a Sammy store to play with the Note 10+ and it's awesome. 
I like the design change, the cameras, the S-pen new capabilities and hell, I'd get it.
BUT
I'm afraid that Sammy will finally bring a higher screen refresh rate on the S11, meaning that would happen on the Note 11.
I love the Note 10+ features, I really do. But they seem like an upgrade while a 90hz screen would be something new, and I think I'm inclined to want something new rather then an upgrade. 

Do you think Samsung will finally bring the 90hz panels in 2020? Do you think is better to wait another year, while also risking for that not to happen or should I just swallow it and get a Note 10+? 
Obviously this is debate is created in mind because I have regular (medium) income. If I would have been in the higher middle class, I think  I'd get a phone whenever I felt like getting it.

I first remove the case I have. Wireless charging DOES work with the case I have, but I still remove it anyway to give it a better chance.

I turn on PowerShare, place my watch on the back of the phone, and it makes the ""doo doot"" sound to acknowledge it's charging. It'll then complain about placement. 

I reposition the watch, it makes the  the ""doo doot"" sound again and then it complains again about the position. I finally get it positioned correctly and it charges for about 15 seconds before it then complains about the position...even though it never moved. Rinse/repeat.

I was wondering if anyone knew where to get a screen protector similar to the one that came on the phone out of the box.

I've left my one on as I really like the notch for the camera. Alot of the other screen protectors cut around the camera instead of going around the camera.

..aside from the obvious, i.e. post-processing and camera crews, of course.  The default camera/video app is rubbish, unless there's something I'm missing with it.  For example, there's not even an option to shoot in 24 FPS to even achieve that ""cinematic"" look and feel.  From what I saw with the behind the scenes of the short film's production there weren't any lenses attached to the phone for the purpose of demonstrating the power of the phone itself.  I'm even betting on there being very minimum post-processing for that reason alone. 

That being said there had to be an advanced (and I'm sure not-free) camera/video app Samsung was using to achieve this.  I'm looking to make a short (and inexpensive) film using the phone as a proof-of-concept for a bigger project I'm pitching to a professional.

Now, I'm considering a Note 9 upgrade, but T-Mobile doesn't really sell their version anymore, but I also wanted to skip the whole unlocking procedure with them and just get the phone outright unlocked from Samsung store or a local brick &amp; mortar store or something...

My main question is: Will the UNLOCKED U.S. version of Note 9 work the same as my T-Mobile version of my Note 8 in regards to using it outside of the U.S.?

Will it be region-locked (I'm not too familiar with that term but I've seen it be an issue with a lot of people, that they have to make a 5 minute call to their country of origin to unlock the region they are currently in i.e, Europe etc.)???

Does the unlocked U.S. version of the Note 9 have the same CDMA/GSM band frequencies as the T-Mobile carrier Note 8 version, Essentially working the same way overseas and at home? I'm just wondering if all the frequency bands available on my Note 8 are also in the Note 9 and none were removed or changed. I don't remember what band it was that I was on in Europe on Vodafone.

Samsung apparently also made a back up of my gallery, and when I go into my empty gallery, and hit sync now, it begins going through and syncing all the photos so now they show up in my gallery. However, this not only takes quite a long time, but I don't think they're actually being placed on the phone its self .

it's an year and so i've been using my tab s4 to take handwritten notes (engineering) during lessons but i'm struggling with Samsung Notes because:

1. PDF conversion is crap cause resolution is too damn low, also pages are cropped making some parts unreadable
2. No page organization (don't get why they removed this useful function that old S Notes had) so i get ridiculously long JPEGs.
3. Can't open .SDOC files outside samsung devices

It's clear it turns to be nearly impossible to share my notes with my other non-samsung devices without clunky tricks.

So i tried the old S-Note app but writing it's pretty, well, uncomfortable...

Do you have an alternative that will work fine with the s-Pen? Somebody suggested to me Bamboo Paper or Squid for example, it's important for me to make them into PDFs not screwed up.

dezztb," Have also posted in r/galaxys8, though I'm not sure if anyone there knows/if this is common to other devices.

Hi all. I use an S8+ (SM-G955FD) now running Android 9 that was purchased in March 2018. It's been fine until around September 2019, when it suddenly began rebooting out of nowhere. I may be using it halfway, or just having it on the table next to me, when suddenly it will go black and boot from the Samsung Galaxy S8+ logo. It gets really frustrating because I have no idea when it'll happen. So far, I have not been able to discern any pattern in the reboots, including:

* timing (can happen any time of day)
* apps open at the time
* number of apps open at the time
* temperature
* whether or not I'm using a phone case
* whether or not it's in a pocket
* whether or not I manually clear RAM
* whether or not I'm in power saving mode
* whether before or after the OTA software update that was pushed out in September (it started shortly before)

I have wiped the cache partition, and booted to safe mode, but found nothing that could be the problem. Is there anything I haven't tried? Am skeptical about doing a factory reset because I worry it might not help. One thing I do notice is that it tends to happen in clusters (few reboots within about 10 minutes). It went into a bootloop and high temperature once, which I thankfully somehow managed to stop by turning it off and letting it cool down. Most of the time, however, it's a couple of boots - the phone boots, is usable for a short time before it random-reboots again. Sometimes, the subsequent boots go straight to the Samsung logo (not the S8+ powered by Samsung one).

df5ybz,"I've had the Tab S2 for about 3yrs. It's always glitched (screen freeze, then screen reset), app fails (Google News, really?) and the battery sucked since I've owned it. The battery was nothing I've read about. I've since pulled it from Verizon network and just doing WiFi (over 1yr ago - no more updates - /sadface). I've reset the Tab S2 back to factory, but still glitches/battery issues.

I've fixed it. Process of elimination and covering the front camera lens did the trick.

I tried everything up to that point, then I'd put it back if it didn't fix the issue (change management). I don't/didn't have any apps, other than Samsung camera, accessing that front camera, so it didn't make sense. Apps that ""shouldn't"" have access to the camera failed, stop, etc.

No more. So, if you're experiencing similar issues, just try a piece of tape. My battery now says it'll die in a couple of days, v. a couple of hours.

df9fq4,"This is kinda a crazy story, so I thought I'd go ahead and share. You'd thing Samsung would not send the incorrect item three times, right? At least they could lie to me and tell me the color I want is out of stock, but no...

Towards the beginning of August 2019, my right Galaxy Bud broke under warranty. This pair was one I purchased from an online retailer and I was able to exchange it to Samsung for free, under warranty for free. Keep in mind this pair was white.

Unfortunately, when the new pair arrived two weeks later, it was in the Yellow color. This matters to me as I'd expect the same product to be returned. I was never made aware of why this color change occurred and the Galaxy Buds were still in stock in white online. This didn't make sense to me, so I called customer service back about this. They said it was simply a mistake, so I sent back the yellow pair for a white pair.

Unfortunately, two weeks later, I recieved yet another yellow pair. This absolutely made no sense. I called back again the day those arrived and told Customer Service the issue. They said they would escalate this situation. A few days later, I was called by someone higher up in the customer service department who apologized profusely about this and agreed to send me a white pair. They said it would definitely be white this time and said it would arrive in a few business days.

This brings us to today, nearly THREE WEEKS later (so much for their ""fastest shipping""), where the earbuds arrive again. Yellow. A third time. After the customer service lady said for the third time they would be WHITE.

This all seems kinda crazy to me, so if anyone here has insight into what to do, let me know! I'm done trying to contact the customer service and promotion lines as they are obviously hot garbage with this issue. I sent this information to the office of the CEO today, so fingers crossed they can help.",samsung,2019-10-08 16:50:28

&amp;#x200B;

A couple minutes later it clicked that the email I received was not from my phone provider, but from Samsung itself. Now I have not had a Samsung phone since June/July last year due to several issues I had with the Note 8. So I went and logged into my Samsung account and found out there were two attempts to place an order for this phone. Both of them were declined by my bank fortunately. I assumed someone had gotten my card information somehow so I called the bank asked them to send me a replacement and deactivate what I had, I also went and change my bank/email passwords; just in case…

Problem solved… I wish…

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I woke up to a third attempt to purchase the same phone, now I am sure whoever is doing this has my Samsung account information. So I proceed to try and delete any payment information I have saved on their site, well it seems that is not an option. Logging into your Samsung account only lets you change your Name, Address and Email. Well… that’s retarded, guess I will have to call them, in the meantime I think I can at least change my password to avoid whoever keeps logging into my account to do it again. Simple enough process, enter old password, enter new password, confirm… DONE!!

&amp;#x200B;

Well I keep trying to find a way to delete my debit card information from the website, and while this happens I got logged out, I try logging in again but forgot I just changed the password and enter the old one… IT WORKS!! WTF!!! I must be crazy right? I just changed the password for a totally different one, well guess what folks? Both passwords work, so now whoever has my account info can still log in as usual.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I have called Samsung costumer service 4 times already with no resolution, I recreated the steps to purchase a new phone online as well and I noticed that Samsung saved my debit card information and does not require it to be updated if the card expires nor will it ask for a security code before attempting to do a new purchase. 

&amp;#x200B;

So just a quick summary of all the flaws I have found on Samsung’s website so far:

\-	There is no way to delete or even saved payment information through their website, unless you actually try buying a new phone. And even then, it will not let you delete it.

\-	They do not require expiration information or security code from your card, it seems the last legit purchase I did from their site was in June 2018… I have probably had my card replaced 2-3 times already since then.

\-	Changing the password on the account does not work!! I currently have two passwords that will allow me to log into my account.

At this point I am running out of ideas on how to proceed, does anyone know if I have grounds to file an FTC complaint in the meantime? Samsung really needs to fix up these issues asap. Anyway, going to call Samsung again right now, will update when I get this resolved…",samsung,2019-10-10 07:14:28

￼

Samsung will make major software-related announcements at its developers’ conference next month. That’s when we’ll get a good look at One UI 2.0, the next major iteration of its custom skin. The company will likely also detail its plans for Android 10 at the event.
As you can probably expect, there will be quite a few new features included in One UI 2.0. We hear that one of those features will be Emoji suggestions and predictions. It will be a fun little addition to the Samsung Keyboard. It will surface these suggestions as you’re typing along.

Emoji suggestions will be part of One UI 2.0

This won’t really be a groundbreaking feature. There are countless messaging apps that will show Emoji suggestions and predictions as you type. KakoTalk, a Korean messaging app that’s quite popular across Asia, is one such example. Line is another.
Similar functionality has long been offered by third-party keyboards as well. Offering this feature with the native keyboard will ensure that users have fewer reasons to switch away from Samsung Keyboard.
We recently got our first look at Android 10 and One UI 2.0 on a Galaxy S10. The video showed a glimpse of the new gesture system that Android 10 brings to the table. Google has made it mandatory for OEMs to bring these stock navigation gestures to their devices.

dghsf2,"I haven't had a Samsung phone since the Captivate and am loving my Note 10+. I haven't been this excited with a phone purchase in a long time.  
I found out about Bixby routines, and sadly am now hearing about other apps that can do a lot of things that routines can do.  
But this is what I have and am going to use.  
Anyways, here are some of my routines that I have set up and would like to see what you guys are using.

At home (location based): wifi on, AOD on, bluetooth off (don't use it at home), ringer on  
In car (bluetooth device connected): Disable lock screen, play music with google play, AOD off, wifi off  
At work (location based): wifi off, AOD off, bluetooth off, set to vibrate

Some creative ones that I found

Atmos (selected by app): certain apps turn on atmos (music, youtube, gallery)  
Auto-rotate (selected by app): I have auto rotate off, when certain apps are enabled, they enable it. (youtube, gallery, games)  
Blue light filter (location AND time based) if at home after X:XX and before X:XX, then turn on Blue light filter
Volume down (selected by app): Games set media volume to 25%

This are most of my Bixby routines that I have set up. I'm sure there's a way to optimize what I have set up, but it's doing mostly what I ask it to.

My only ""fixes"" or changes that I'd like to make are being able to set the ringer to a specific volume (so work can have the ringer at 10% and home can have it at 50%).  
And I'd like to be able to set a ""default state"". So if none of the conditions (routines) are active, then the phone goes into the default state (ringer at 100%, no wifi, aod off, and so on)",samsung,2019-10-11 08:43:01
dgi45b,"I've been looking into getting an S10+ these past few months, and after digging on ebay and realizing that Best Buy had it on a steep discount ($600 new) during Prime Day, i decided I'll just wait until Black Friday to pick one up for hopefully even $500 before tax if it gets discounted that much. I didn't really care for the rumored S11 at the time because of no headphone jack (which i literally use every day, and assumed wouldn't exist anyway after the Note 10 and the upper-range A series phones) and the camera upgrades don't interest me that much.

After hearing about the strong possibility of a 90Hz display, however, or even a 120Hz, I decided to take a second to consider the next one. While I've never actually used or seen a high refresh rate phone before, i do use a 144hz monitor on my main computer, and hearing people like Marques and Linus speak so highly of the display rate of the OnePlus 7P or iPad Pro made me very interested. So now I'm confused on whether to try for a very cheap S10+ soon or wait until next Prime Day for a decent discount on the S11.

For reference, i plan on keeping the phone for the next 3 or so years, so the decision is pretty significant. I also don't want to spend $1000 on a phone, so buying the 10+ next month and then trading it in for an S11 if i end up liking that is not really reasonable to me. Any advice?

dgt7o7,"So a few years back when the exploding Note 7 incident occurred, I returned my Note 7 expecting a refund. But Samsung claimed that I never returned the 2nd unit they sent out and refused to give me a refund no matter how hard I tried. Fast forward to August of 2019, I received a lost parcel with the 2nd Note 7 unit that they sent out and claimed I had. 

I called up Samsung's support line that referred me to enrsupport@samsung.com and after a lot of back and fourth they agreed to refund me once I returned the 2nd unit. So they sent me a return label package and I returned the unit in the middle of August. 

Now it's been over 2 months where Samsung claims they're going to be refunding me repeatedly, but all they end up doing is giving me the run around and constantly ignoring status update requests. They've been giving me excuses such as their account department is on vacation, ""the VP at Tech Data is involved now and you should be seeing a refund on your card soon"", ""I'll contact them again for an update"", ""I just spoke on the phone with them earlier today and you'll be getting your refund"".

I even tried calling Tech Data directly and got some low level support agents that said they would follow up with me weeks ago and never did. 

TLDR - Samsung Canada refuses to refund my exploding Note 7 purchase and keeps giving me lies and excuses and I would really appreciate some help.

Sometimes when I put it on the charger, it also records that as sleep (you'd think the fact that its sensors do not detect skin or heartbeat as it draws power would make this obvious).

Since sleep tracking is helpful for my personal health records,  I usually have to go to the Samsung Health app on my phone and delete this erroneous data.

Last year I convinced my wife (a long time iPhone user) to try the new Galaxy Note 9 and she had fallen in love with this phone...until. 6 months in the phone had started to have charging issues. we tried flashing it, factory resetting it, cleaning the charge port, switching chargers, buying original Samsung adapters and so on. the phone will only slow charge on anything except a PureGear charger. to top things off her S Pen cracked (which is apparently an issue). We finally just sent the phone in to be looked at and they called and said that the device was not under warranty because it's water damaged...the phone is water resistant!? she hasn't taken it into water, she does wipe her phone down a lot because she has OCD but that is ridiculous to think that cleaning it has caused enough water damage to prevent fast charge from working.

Contemplating a new phone purchase this year to celebrate a contract extension and also because it's been about 2 years with my old phone.   


An S10 is something I was thinking about but one thing I've heard about / experienced(current phone is LG) with non Google phones is that most companies tend to be pretty slow on updating their phones; that being said, for all the long-time Galaxy / Note owners - how has Samsung been with regards to things like security updates?   


Feature updates would be great... but honestly that's less important than having security updates delivered in a reasonably timely fashion. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a side note - I was considering an iPhone 11 too, given the new cameras + added battery life + being able to trade in an old testing device, I'm pretty certain I'll end up sticking with Android but if anyone had thoughts on that, that'd be great to hear too.

dhop2q,"Hello guys,

I've recently bought Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and I went for a vacation. At some point my original display foil got ""messy"" in the middle. It created a bubble so I put foil down. I went to a beach and then a friking small sand got a small scratch on my display. It kinda upsets me. Do you have any experience on fixing small scratches or I have to live with that? Thanks.",samsung,2019-10-14 02:30:11

I am not sure what to try at this point? I have a good case from spigen but those bubble lines on all the sides are really annoying...",samsung,2019-10-14 04:26:25

What I fell in love with was the dark mode , ad blockers and in general a better looking appearance compared to brave . Another big plus is being able to use the spen to go back a page and scroll down like chrome .


Anybody here use this browser?",samsung,2019-10-14 07:47:19

dhta48,"Hi,

sorry to ask question that it seems many have asked before but I havent had much luck with what I've found.

I've had a Samsung ks8000 for 2+ years and until recently the power command integration with my xbox worked perfectly. Xbox off -&gt; tv off, and vice versa.

This has stopped working when I unplugged my xbox a few days back. I have gone through a tv reset and the xbox settings multiple times with no luck. Has anyone managed to solve this issue and has some useful tips for me to try? Frustrating that this integration no longer works.

My xbox is plugged into the arc hdmi spot (tried it in others, as well).",samsung,2019-10-14 08:47:11

dhwtgv,"I just sent bug reports to Samsung.

Here are some of the bugs I'm experiencing from using the One UI 2.0

-Nonstop popup of Android.process.media 
-When taking a screenshot the phone takes nonstop screenshot


What I like about the beta:
-Looks clean
-Gestures are so smooth!!!
- The keyboard are moved up a little so I can type better
-Notification bar looks really nice 
-We finally have built in screen recording now 


What I want to back
-Im not a big fan of the font and color of the font. I miss the old font from the previous One UI",samsung,2019-10-14 12:47:11

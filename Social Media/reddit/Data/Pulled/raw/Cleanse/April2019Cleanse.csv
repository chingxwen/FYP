2,"I'm really hoping someone here can shed a light on this for me. About 3 weeks ago I upgraded TV's and bought a 55inch Smart TV (UN55NU7100FXZA), and everything was great, was streaming UHD on Netflix, everything was playing in 4K smoothly on Youtube, the whole 9. So then I was away from home for about 2 weeks, and then when I come back yesterday... I can hardly stream 1080p without buffering every 30 seconds. Wtf? For context, my internet speeds float at around 150 down/25 up with a single digit ping. This is current, I can get these results on any device in my house in any room on the same connection, and I assumed the Smart TV shared the same results until recently. Right now I can't test higher than 23 down/ 7 up with a ping anywhere from 130-270 on my TV. Yesterday I got on the online support with Samsung and the fella factory restored my TV's settings, checked for all the updates, and changed the DNS to 8.8.8.8, seemed to work for a little while but then today it's the same thing, can't even stream at a shitty 1080p. So it's obviously not my internet considering I can stream the highest possible resolution on any other device in my house, so what gives?! Everything was going good with the TV until just recently and I have no idea what it could be. This is honestly so frustrating taking into account what the TV is supposed to do, my internet connection, and that it wasn't doing this when I bought it. Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions? There's clearly something wrong that neither Samsung support nor I can figure out so I'm really hoping someone does. I'm this close to returning the thing if it honestly can't even stream 1080p. Thanks.",2019-03-31 18:26:13
3,"So, as you may know, support for VA ended with ONE UI (maybe earlier but I noticed this after the update). I saw some user's screenshot of a chat with samsung's twitter account regarding bringing VA back into SIB and I was wondering if Samsung said something about it in the last month. It was really good feature, if it would be here now, I wouldn't have to watch some films and movies in those shitty players with limited speed (yes, openload and streamango, I'm talking about you). If someone from Samsung will every read that, please, BRING BACK VIDEO ASSISTANT INTO SAMSUNG INTERNET BROWSER",2019-03-31 19:14:32

18,"Hey r/Samsung, It’s with great sadness and sorrow that we announce Samsung Mobile has been acquired by Apple. *After the failure of Samsung’s latest flagship, the S10, and due to the high production costs and low demand for the Galaxy Fold, the company has lost its high share value, causing Apple Inc to buy those shares and effectively take over the Samsung Mobile devision by force.* We have reflected the new *announcement* by updating our banner to represent the future of Samsung. We believe in the future, and we truly believe Apple will bring a lot to the table. Please keep all discussion about this dramatic happening here. &gt;!Happy April 1st Everyone ;)!&lt;",2019-03-31 22:22:55

34,"Since I got my S10 Plus I've been thinking of getting the Galaxy Buds but looking at reviews, some positive, some negative and coming from wearing an over ear pair of AKG -K550's (also amazing) at work all day I didn't expect much sound wise and merely wanted the wireless capability. I was ready to take the hit to sound quality for the freedom but my god... these things sound amazing. After some playing around with the wingtips and ear bud tips to find the best fitting and seal I pressed play on 'Deutschland' and was blown away with how clear it was on the default setting. Good bass without needing the bass boost. The other settings... not so good but that 'Dynamic' setting works beautifully. Find the right combo of wing and tip and boom. Setting the long press to Google Assistant also lets me perform actions on the phone or call without needing to take my phone out. Overall, super impressed and glad I didnt put the purchase off even longer. For anyone on the fence... get off it. Anyone else got any tips or enjoying them?",2019-04-01 10:21:47

I got the Android pie update yesterday on my S8 and i went to see the built in command option, which allows you to activate any speakable command with bixby by pressing the button, but you can only do either pause or play, rather than toggle, and for whatever reason, bixby does nothing without internet, and i do a lot of stuff in airplane mode, including listen to music. That isnt all, of course, because i also cant use bixby unless the phone is both awake and unlocked which makes it even more useless. But the thing that irritates me the most is that the only direct controls you have for music in bixby is for spotify. I use Samsung Music all the time, barely even touch spotify, and they dont even support their own music app with their own support assistant.

61,"After realizing that my 2017 Moto X4 sounded worse than my 1991 Motorola brick phone on AT&amp;T, I took advantage of the Costco $200 cash back and bought an S10e. So far likes and dislikes: - call quality: very good, but TBH I am not impressed. It's 2019 and it's not quite where it should be. Much better than the X4 but still not as good as landline. - Wireless is great. I even got 5G (😂). Works pretty well. Faster than the X4. - WiFi is solid - Samsung skin is minimal. Good. Settings confusing a bit - Display is very good and flat. I would have gotten the S10 if offered with a flat screen. - battery life is ok. I'm still learning the ropes. - physical size: just perfect except for the guy who specified glass back. Slipperier than an eel immersed in WD-40. Spigen case arrives tomorrow - punchhole is not noticeable. A friend sent a link to hilarious backgrounds that cover the hole, the one with Kim Jong Un is priceless. Google it. - gaming is exceptional. Angry Birds 2 flies (pun not intended). I'm running at medium power mode CPU at 70%. Not noticeable. - setup troubles thanks to Android noted in another post. Password party in progress. - wireless charging rocks. Borrowed a friend's pad to test, OMG. Life changing. Buying one. - akg wired buds. Excellent sound quality. A bit cheesy build but good sound. Overall happy, just waiting for the case to come in.",2019-04-01 22:47:23

98,"I'm curious if others have had the same or a similar experience to me trying to use their eCertificate. The whole process of purchasing the S10 and using the promotional $130 eCertificate to purchase the Galaxy Buds has been an unnecessary hassle, and very unprofessionally handled by Samsung. The customer service during this process has been absolutely atrocious. &amp;#x200B; Here's a list of gripes I have about this whole thing. I'm curious if anyone else picked up on this, and finds this whole thing a bit fishy: \- It wasn't clear that you would need to wait weeks after receiving your phone to even get the eCertificate code. \-There have been conflicting emails from Samsung, and an overall severe lack of communication about the process from start to finish. \-Samsung Phone support explained that this was done so the code would be sent right after the return window closed for the phone. I guess I understand this from Samsung's perspective, but that should have been well communicated to each customer. \- Promotional emails that I received prior to purchasing the S10 state that the following regarding the use of the eCertificate: &gt;"" By 4﻿/﻿4﻿/﻿1﻿9, using your Qualifying Purchase device, follow instructions on the Shop Samsung app (""App"") to submit required info. "" \-It says in the eCertificate email that it expires 06/27/19. I'm not sure which email(s) to believe. \-The galaxy buds have been out of stock for a while with no way to reserve them or put your name down on a list to receive them once they are available again. \-The support experience is bad at best. The online chat takes 20 minutes to get in contact with anyone, trying to get someone on the phone results in talking to a robot that just keeps repeating itself, and once you get someone on the phone they advise to continuously check the website to know when the galaxy buds become available (This was later clarified by the customer service representative; where she told me that I could add the product to my wishlist) \-Emails from Samsung recommend using the eCertificate for the Galaxy Buds on the Shop Samsung app, however, the product seems to be completely taken off the app. &amp;#x200B;",2019-04-02 16:34:31
103,I am using G A50 and i love this phone. But one thing i hate utmost is the fingerprint scanner. Sure it'd an optical one can't be as fast as physical one but what about the reliability ? Like it's not even trying. Even when i cover the entire fingerprint sensor it says cover the sensor and even when my fingers are perfectly fine and clean it just doesn't match. And also why there are only 3 fingerprint registrations. It would have been much betyer if they just dumped fingerprint sensor and gave us a good reliable face unlock than this piece of crap. Hope Samsung fixes this soon in future updates.

104,Just bought a Note 8 and a Dex dock (first gen) and I can't seem to get the dock to function. I'm using the cable that came with it (a Samsung Adaptive fast charger 9v 1.67amps as per the Dex specifications on the help page) and my phone wont even start to charge with it. The dock is powering my keyboard and mouse while plugged in so I can't think of what might be the problem. The phone charges when I plug it directly into the charger. I'm at a loss of what to do. I think the USB-C port where the phone plugs in might be a dud but I want to try everything before I send this back for a refund.,2019-04-02 20:59:14

119,"Hi, I got myself the S10+ directly from Samsung's online store and in the past 2 weeks I've been noticing that it reboots at random when I'm not using it. Sometimes its on my desk at work or at home, and I'll notice it just rebooting by itself when I'm not even touching it. It reboots on average once a day, usually in the afternoon. Sometimes it never reboots or reboots multiple times in a single day. I was wondering if anyone else is getting this, and if anyone has had this issue in the past with a brand new device. I tried searching for solutions on the internet, but what I have found is mostly posts about the same issue on the Samsung forums with no actual answer from the Samsung support team. I can live with this problem since I've yet to experience the reboot while I'm actively using the device, but it just annoys me as this is a brand new phone (which I haven't dropped) and I love the rest of my experience with it as of writting this.

252,"So I ordered a Q9FN TV from Samsung.com on March 24th. It’s the 2018 model and with the newer model out, I thought I’d be a good opportunity to buy before it goes EOL and they run out. At the time, I was able to buy through the site, sign up for financing and picked my delivery date, which was today, April 5th. Took the day off work to wait for the scheduled delivery and nothing came. Checked the site, still says delivery date: April 5th. Contacted support and only after getting to a supervisor, they told me the TV is backordered. I had to go through support three times, with each tier 1 rep telling me they don’t know and they’d have to forward my email to another team. What pisses me off is that from the time I ordered til now, I was never notified at all. No email telling me there was a change, no notification telling me my shipment will not be coming. Everything pointed to a scheduled delivery date of April 5th. Support told me that they will send my case to their “concern” team, whatever the hell that is. I understand this a 2018 model and it might get sold out. It’s disappointing a company like Samsung’s own e-commerce site lets a customer go through the buy-flow and sign up for financing knowing they don’t have inventory. If I knew it was backordered, I never would have even ordered. I can’t cancel the order because I signed up for Samsung financing. A line of credit that is useless and will be a hit on my credit if I cancel. Has anyone else experienced backorder issues with Samsung.com? How did it get resolved? If I cancel the order, or if Samsung ends up canceling the order, what will happen with the Samsung financing? I got an email from them saying my finance info will be coming in the mail soon (but they couldn’t send me a backorder notification?!).

I have read this is a roku thing and my step dad tends to leave the tv on all day and I know streaming tv can go out of snyc, but even when its off for a bit or reset it seems to be out of sync through just the tv speakers. The samsung tv has a slider that can adjust the audio if it is out of sync but that doesn't do anything. (first time I have ever seen that feature on a tv) For the sound bar when its in 'tv' mode the sound bar seems to wirelessly link with the tv for audio even when I shut off bluetooth on the sound bar. I thought having a direct plug via the pass through on the tv hdmi would solve the audio trouble but no luck. If this is mostly the roku not syncing well I am thinking of getting their amazon echo cube from downstairs to try. But wanted to check if audio sync trouble is common samsung tvs?

Additionally, I can see that people are not posting their pictures in the picture thread. I get it. They want greater visbility - - but the issue is no one gets visibility if everyone posts on the main thread. This is why photo threads are useful, to curate and highlight photos. Samsung is a crazy large company. It doesn't make sense that a Samsung subreddit only has photography posts and photos of your cellphones. There so many other things that this company does. What do guys think? I like to see the Apple sub as good example of technology discussion on Reddit. I think we should strive towards something similar and I believe we can get just as big. Mods are not being able to keep up with all the photography posts being submitted . The sub is growing rapidly and frankly too much content to moderate.

386,"So just recently ordered a Tab S4 and keyboard for $550(no tax), I've been testing Dex with my S9 in the meantime. &amp;#x200B; I notice that apps are basically useless, unless it's a video app. It's almost always easier to just use Samsung browser instead. Reddit,banking,ebay,etc,, all seem to work better in the browser. Most apps are not good blown up and look stretched. &amp;#x200B; I still bought it for the amoled screen,great battery life and size. Laptops usually last about 5-8 hours, with this being rated at 16 hours. I owned a chromebook before and was okay, but too limiting even with android apps. This seems like a good device for me, as I won't be doing anything intensive and mostly web/video/games. For same usage as my chromebook, the S4 gives me way better battery life and better screen. &amp;#x200B; For anyone looking at S5e, might be better buying Tab S4 for headphone jack,better cpu/gpu, and S pen. They're on ebay for around $400-$500 for tablet only. With keyboard I've seen some from $550-$600.",2019-04-08 20:59:13

396,"My apologies for the bad title. but I am unsure how to describe this question ins short form. Recently I upgraded from a Samsung J3 2016 (or so) to a J3 Achieve (2018?). Texting on the new phone is a little weird. Any text over a certain character limit gets turned from an SMS to an MMS. In addition, the phone said that the MMS will be send the next time I am connected to phone data. Although I was connected to WIFI, it only seemed to send when turning the data on. Now I did find a option that automatically makes text into group conversations and turned it off. Doesn't seem to be doing much. In the end, ideally, I would like to be able to just write my whole text as an SMS and send it. Is this possible at all? Do I just need to break my SMS up into segments? And when I do want to send an MMS, either with pictures or to a group, can I do so over WIFI or to I have to use the data? Any advice on this silliness?

I'm surprised with all the usage I have I end the day with 30-40% capacity left from a full charge. I am genuinely impressed by how long the battery lasts. I hope the battery maintains this same sort of resilience a year or two from now, as that's when you get to see how much these companies put into the quality of their batteries when they hit those particular milestones in their lifespan.

Im almost worried that the touch pads shouldnt be used as often or too much.

466,"So I have been using Samsung since the note edge and every note since then till now the note 8 from 2017, waiting for the release of the note 10. I bought the extended warranty with the phone because the sales told me that their new warranty will be able to cover the cost of replacing my screen if I dropped the phone and cracked it and etc. it sounded like a really good deal to me, so I got it. Since the day I got the phone, I realize that there was a really small black half circle on the right side screen, but I always thought it was a problem with the app that I was using or some sort of software issue and didn't bother about it because it was so small. Recently I came across a post and some youtube videos about other users majority of them are note 8 specifically having the same issue and they say it is a hardware issue (defect) of dead pixels and they were able to send it to Samsung to replace or fix it. So I contacted the online support about this, then they told me to contact the service center and then told me to call the service line. but I wanted to be sure so I went into a service center in person to ask about this. Arriving at the service center no one came and ask for help even though it was empty and there were at least five or six people standing around. so I went to the desk and asked what could be the problem and how I can get it fixed and how much it would cost (expected zero or at most $50 due to the warranty). The two people that were at the table had a very disrespectful attitude the entire time. They took the phone and saw the cracks on my screen and said it is a hardware issue but it is not the phone's problem it is because I dropped it. although I explained it has been there since the beginning but they didn't believe me and just kept repeating that it is 100% my problem and they will not be able to fix it for free. So I asked how much will it cost and what it will replace or fix. they said anything that causes the problem will be replaced and it'll cost $130 and then tax, but they cannot fix it today I will have to call and get a service number and then come back. But $130 is a lot of money for this small problem, and I don't think it is worth it since we are just 4 months away from the note 10 release. Now I understand that it is the procedure that in order to get my phone fixed I have to call and get a number and then come back and fix the phone, but it is their attitude that gets me mad. and I just want to know that what does the warranty even cover, if it cannot replace a screen, cannot fix a defect and it charges such a high price for fixing. What was the $200 warranty I paid for even for? And why do salespeople say things that are not true in order to sell the warranty? I like Samsung and I don't think I will switch to any other phones, but I just never had such a bad experience on warranties and bad attitude salesmen. I also don't think I will ever spend money on Samsung's warranty if they are not able to fix anything they promise. (I agree maybe it is my problem that I didn't check online to see what the warranty covers, but it is rare for someone to go buy a phone and on the spot to do research on products such as the warranty) &amp;#x200B; TL;DR Bought warranty, cannot get the problem fixed for free or within the expected range. Had super bad attitude service. Probably won't buy the warranty coz it doesn't cover anything that's important I guess (just personal experience please no bashing)",2019-04-10 22:12:19

13,"Hey guys, &amp;#x200B; So I've had my Galaxy S8 since it launched and have been extremely happy with it. I have had Samsung phones since the S2 and have always loved them. Problem is my battery life is really poor now that I've been using it for 2 years, plus I have a small yet deep corner crack in the screen glass that could easily damage the display if it gets worse. Bottom line is I'm looking for an upgrade and I have always wanted a Note. Looking on Ebay, I could get the Note 8 in open box/new condition for around [$350]( or I could get a Note 9 in the same condition for [$550]( &amp;#x200B; Is the Note 9 worth the extra $200? The biggest difference for me at least is the bigger battery. Its one of the main reasons I'm looking to upgrade from my old S8 but the 17% increase from Note 8's 3,300 mAh to the Note 9's 4,000 mAh doesn't seem like a lot considering their difference in price. A few more differences include the Bluetooth S Pen, a better placed finger print sensor, a slightly brighter screen, and the benefits of a longer Android update lifespan. &amp;#x200B; Has anyone lived with both? Is it worth the extra money? Are there significant features that will come with the 9 that I'm not seeing? Is the difference in battery really that noticeable? Thanks in advance. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2019-06-01 09:28:59

He went away and tried setting it up, put in a password then somehow locked the phone. The shop wouldn't do any more and told him to send it back. The amazon seller is refusing to refund him because it's locked (not sure why they can't factory reset). Amazon haven't been helpful. I've told him to go back to the Samsung shop to get them to reset it but don't know if they will help. Am I right in thinking he can do a factory reset?

I didn't even care much for the whole ""but muh pixel camera doe"" thing since honestly the s10e takes amazing photos (from what I can see so far). I don't even use social media so the camera doesn't matter to me. People say they hate ""dat dang samsung bloatware"", but honestly, the s10e feels like a much more unison and cohesive experience and does not feel bloated as much as people make it out to seem. The ui is amazing and does not stutter or lag when scrolling or switching apps. What it came down to is wanting to feel like I'm getting a 2019 phone in the year of well, 2019, and the s10e is right there with the modern specs to back it up. The Pixel 3 (even if realized in 2018) was and is still far behind these Samsung phones.

276,"I just now got the June update because it kept prompting me when I was actively usibg my phone. I hate it. Almost everything about it, and as someone with a Master's in Human Factors, this isn't just ""oh it changed, I don't like change."" I know and understand interfaces, and the new ""features"" here do nothing at best, and ROB users of functionality at worst. Lets start at the bottom of importance, the appearance. The new icons are blocky, primative, and look terrible on my old background. They make me think of a children's toy. The home and back buttons now feel like stickers on the bottom of my screen as well. Related, but more intrusive, is the new recent apps menu (button left of Home on my device). The preview windows again feel like stickers, and you can only see the most recent app without scrolling! In the old layout I could see, click, and reopen several apps back which made multi-tasking or comparing windows so easy! Now if I want to compare more than two things, I have to constantly scroll back and forth, as they change order depending on when I opened them. Yes, the order used to change then too, but with the larger ""buffer"" of seeing several apps back it was a faster and clearer task. The scrolling itself even feels sluggish since you have to move through an entire screen to see one more option. Want a similar example on a function EVERYONE uses, dozens of times a day? How about the new ""Messages"" app screen where, no joke, FIFTY PERCENT of the screen is DEAD SPACE. I KNOW I'm in messages! I can see them, right there! All my conversations! Or should I say FOUR of my conversations? You know, since that's all that fits without scrolling now? SUPER helpful to have LESS information avalible to me, and have it replaced with LITERALLY NOTHING. But this, I am forced to admit, at least still FUNCTIONS... Now we get to one of the worst parts, the change in the settings buttons. Good lord is this a mess...buttons have entirely changed appearences, have been moved to other places in the menu, and some are flat out baffling! Because the Auto-rotate button is automatically grey, displays a lock, and says ""portrait"" it appears to be a button that TURNS ON screen lock. 90% of settings in phones color in when on, and turn grey when off. This is the established model in people's heads, and is reinforced even on Samsung phones. This button though changes meaning entirely when clicked, suddely lighting up, becoming an actual ""Auto Rotate"" button, and now indicating that rotate is ON. This one option uses two contradictory models simultaniously! Did a designer even LOOK at it?? Last point for me for now: Where did my Always On Display go!? I LOVED being able to see the time and my notifications simply by glancing down! It was a MAJOR selling point of the phone for me! Now, not only is ALL of that gone, even when I DO wake the phone the time is miniscule in one corner, I can see MAYBE three recent notifaction TYPES...I could read entire messages with one simple click on the old system! I have been touting the merits of Samsung phones up and down for YEARS now...even through the utter debachle that was removing individual text tones...and as a tech-savy person that is also educated in the design of interfaces, I can adapt to most changes very readily...but this is an absoulute travesty! Please, please, PLEASE roll back this interface!!

406,"First off, is there somewhere that I can leave feedback for samsung? If not I hope someone at samsung reads this. So I made the switch to android from apple about two years ago with the galaxy note 8 which is a pretty great phone and I really like it but I've had a more than a few issues with it. I was really impressed with the customer care though because they resolved my issues every single time. The major issue I had was with the screen, after about 10 months of buying the Note 8 I began to notice an imprint of the keyboard on my screen, I visited the service centre and they replaced the screen for me and after a few months the new screen began to have the same exact issue so I went back to the service center but by now the warranty had expired and they expected me to pay for a new screen. I called customer care and told them it was not fair for them to expect me to pay for a screen that I have seen fail for me already twice so after some convincing they fixed for me for free and guess what? I'm having the same issue again and I doubt they are going to entertain me again. I hate having to see this imprint on my screen and was in half a mind to buy a oneplus but I noticed videos on youtube talking about a Note 10 coming soon so I decided to hold on a bit more and wait for the Note 10. As per my understanding the note 10 is not going to have a headphone jack which honestly I'm not happy about but I can live without it if samsung provides usbc earphones. I am hearing that there will be no bixby button which I am grateful for! I hope samsung take a cue from oneplus and avoid packing the phone up with useless apps or at least let them be deleteable. I hate having my app drawer stacked with shit I don't use, same as with the iphone, I don't know why they force you to have their apps I mean preload them if you want but after paying a thousand dollars for a phone I expect the freedom to choose what apps I keep on it on remove from it. Yo man people at samsung if you're reading this I gotta tell you I was a click away from buying the oneplus and it is only my positive experience with the samsung customer care and the note 8 in general that has convinced me to wait for a bit. Don't make me go to oneplus or apple because I will if you force me too. Also can we please have something as quick as warp charging on the note 10? That would really help. Think of the kind of person that would buy note, we do a lot of our work on our phones. Battery life is paramount. Everything else can take a hike. Sorry about the rant but those are my thoughts.

416,"Hey guys, I wanted to share with you my experience with Samsung’s trade-in program. I know everyone has had different experiences, so just to give you guys an idea of what someone went through from beginning to end, here’s my experience: TLDR: Not good. They rejected my phone for reasons that were definitely untrue, and I ended up getting my device back and being charged full price for the S10. &amp;#x200B; **May 01, 2019:** Samsung was offering $350 for my LGV30. I was very well aware of the negative reviews their trade-in was getting, but because it was more than double what I could sell it for on eBay, I went through hoping I wouldn’t be one of the unlucky ones. I purchased the Galaxy S10 from their website and received an instant discount for $350 on checkout. &amp;#x200B; **May 02:** Samsung ships the S10. &amp;#x200B; **May 06:** I receive the package. &amp;#x200B; **May 10:** I factory reset my old device, removed SIM and SD card, took photos of it for documentation, packaged it, and dropped it off with the shipping carrier (FedEx). &amp;#x200B; **May 14:** The tracking info shows that they received the package. &amp;#x200B; **May 17:** I receive the first email regarding my trade-in. They rejected it claiming that I didn’t factory reset the phone. They offered me $25 for it. (My phone is also factory unlocked, so it's also not that). I contacted Samsung so I can provide photos that would prove it was reset when I sent it to them. They opened up a ticket and told me it could take 5 business days. &amp;#x200B; **May 18:** I reconsidering fighting the decision after reading how drawn out these could get (some people online claiming it took weeks). I didn’t want to risk it taking weeks only for them to decide arbitrarily that their decision stands and I can either take the $25.00 or forfeit the phone (Samsung only allows you to request a return for the first 7 days from when they make their decision). I requested online that my device be returned. &amp;#x200B; **May 19:** I receive an email saying my request to have my device returned has been accepted and I’ll receive an email with the tracking information once it’s shipped out to me. &amp;#x200B; **May 29**: I receive an email with the tracking number for my trade in-device. I get charged the $350 to my Samsung Financing account. &amp;#x200B; **June 5:** I was having trouble with a FedEx driver who was caught lying about attempting delivery of my package, so I requested to pick it up at a local facility. (a story of it's own). I pick up my trade-in device at the FedEx facility. To my utter disappointment, the phone was locked by whoever was handling it at the facility, but luckily I guessed the passcode on the first attempt - which was simply 0000. The phone has been set-up enough to show you the homescreen. I see an app installed on the phone called mceframework, which I couldn't find any info on.

422,"Hi all, &amp;#x200B; I need your thoughts on something I noticed last night on my new Galaxy S9+. &amp;#x200B; While the screen was on, there seems to be one pixel that just won't turn black when it should. If the whole screen is turned off, it's fine. But when it's on, that pixel will somehow stay on/visible in an area of the interface that's supposed to be black. Even when the Always On Display kicks in after I lock the phone, suddenly this pixel will also come on and just won't budge. It doesn't change color even. I'm not sure what's going on. Thankfully, it's within the return period, but the unit I have is already replacing a first one which exhibited Bluetooth problems. Even if I miss out on the chance to maybe swap out this new unit, I do have Geek Squad Protection (I bought the phone at Best Buy), so I'm not letting the issue get to me because during the day, I don't really notice it.

Can I load e-books (I know the sceen is small, but still would be nice) on the watch? 3. Does it have the ability to access Facebook as a whole app (not just messenger)? 4. Youtube? 5. Does it have the option to connect to my phones wifi hotspot? Or does the bluetooth allow me to connect to the internet? I guess I'm mostly curious as to what the full functionality is on a smart watch. Is it like a smart phone but shrunken down and on your wrist? Or is the app variety extremely limited? Thank you.",2019-06-13 13:13:40
435,"Hey all, &amp;#x200B; I've this Samsung tablet in my kitchen, always plugged in to USB power. It's an SM-T520. An older piece of hardware obviously, but its still good enough for recipes, home-assistant client, spotify, etc. Basic stuff. &amp;#x200B; Since the start of this year at some point, I've noticed this random behaviour where when I go to use it, I swipe to login, and none of the icons work. I have to ""unblock"" it, but swiping down the menu, entering settings, closing settings, then stuff works. (this is super annoying) &amp;#x200B; After further monitoring/watching, eventually I caught it rebooting itself -- if left idle, suddenly it will restart, the Samsung logo appears, and Android boots. (rinse and repeat cycle) &amp;#x200B; If I leave an app open that holds screen on (i.e. Arlo camera monitor app), the tablet will NEVER reboot itself. (so it seems related to ""power saving"" maybe in some way). &amp;#x200B; Has anyone ever experienced this, and/or know how to debug it? I tried installing some root log monitor app(s) but it doesn't yield anything interesting. I'm a linux guy, but I have no idea how to debug Android. &amp;#x200B; Specs/Details: * SM-T520 * Android 4.4.2 * kernel 3.4.39-2776001 * Build KOT49H.T520UESAQA4 * SE enforcing, ASKS v1.2\_161011",2019-06-13 21:12:40
442,"I've really liked the screen protector that came pre-installed on my S10+, but know it will need to be replaced eventually. Has anyone found one that's comparable?

448,"Apologies if this is not allowed on this sub. Phone does not turn on, when it turns on it gets stuck in white screen. Basically this happened after the phone overheated while charging and I was never able to get it to work after. No scratches on front screen and comes with original box.

454,"I've used Samsung Health to track my heart rate and stress level on and off and while the stress level measures have always been incredibly inaccurate the heart rate tends to be good. This morning when checking my resting pulse I had a heart rate of 137 bpm, which if accurate means I was 38 bpm above the total range of resting pulse for people my age (and health) and it puts me almost 80 bpm over my average. This didn't feel right at all so I tried checking my pulse manually to compare and while I could feel that it was higher than normal it wasn't near 137 bpm. I'm not the best at checking my pulse but it was between 70 - 80. So I waited a while. Made some breakfast, took a relaxing shower and did a short guided meditation just too be ""over-relaxed"". Still 100+ bpm. There is no way this is accurate. Has anyone else got the same issue?",2019-06-14 07:51:50

I already trying searching for answers but so far no results. Only I mangaded to stop vibration. I tried anything what I could do: Force restart (holding power button + voulme down - it just stops vibration; Trying to access debug screen (I belive it's power button + voulme up + home button) - it justs restarts vibration, so this means I can't even factory reset.

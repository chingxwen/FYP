16,"Intro: First things first, when I upgraded from my Note8 to the Note9 I've had issues with the procurement process. I normally go through Best Buy Mobile but this time in order to get a \~$400 trade in credit I had to go through Samsung directly which tied to my Verizon account. That said, I had a bunch of issues actually getting the websites to talk to each other and had several phone/emails until finally someone found me a workaround (and apparently a lot of people were having issues). Few weeks later I got an email that the trade in credit was declined for the additional amount (\~$200 difference, if memory serves) and there was nothing they could do about it. So I'm already feeling ripped off/cheated (I have screenshots and all to prove it, worked those up to management teams who approved and then others ultimately declined). &amp;#x200B; That's not even the main part... &amp;#x200B; Yesterday I get a generic email from Samsung Customer Support (same team I was working with on above) about my request being received (which I never submitted??). Today I get phone call (Caller ID: Samsung Electronics Canada Inc.) and a gentleman who starts by explaining the reason for his call which went something like this... &amp;#x200B; ""I'm not sure if you have noticed, but you haven't been getting billed by Verizon lately for your device payments and therefore we haven't been receiving those funds"" I go to look at my Verizon bill and he's correct, I did not see any device installments for the Note9 on recent bills. I hear people in the call center having the same conversation with other customers which aligns with him telling me... ""This is a known issue we're trying to work through with Verizon but the only resolutions are one of two things: 1) Return the device to us and receive a \~$500 credit or 2) pay us the full remaining balance of $500 and keep the device. So I'm totally caught off guard at this point. The deal when I signed the contract was a monthly installment that would be paid through Verizon which was initially what was going on. I start explaining how I'm not surprised this is the case because we knew early on their systems weren't communicating with one another. I asked what they're doing for customers because this is clearly not an acceptable ask. He said he can offer me the option to keep the freebies (wireless charger and phone case (if I decide to keep the phone)). I begin laughing as does he and he explains he's aware of the obvious insanity of that offer but that's all they're allowed to do. &amp;#x200B; I ask how I would even go about paying if I wanted to and he made it sound like I would call Verizon, pay the total, and they pay Samsung (this makes no sense, because that's the challenge they said they're having in the first place was getting payment from Verizon). He suggested I call Verizon, confirm the story is legit (and he's not a fraud), and then follow through with them. To which I suggested, he have them call me, we figure out how to get installments working again, and we keep on keeping on, otherwise, not my problem. I also mentioned that I'm not paying anyone other than Verizon because that was not the arrangement. They've already breached the original agreement I made from the get-go and now they're asking for in-full payment. I am mind boggled this is happening and also that I couldn't find anything online about this from others yet. Question, what would you do? Am I in the wrong if I don't call Verizon/Samsung and pay them $500 to even up? Is there any potential this impacts credit scores or anything caused by Samsung? I'd imagine not because I don't have credit or anything setup with them... I feel this is something they should be working with Verizon on. Oh also, I noticed on Verizon's website that I'm eligible for an upgrade which insinuates the device is paid off, so that kind of holds true to his story but also means that as far as Verizon is concerned, I own the device out right...",2019-02-01 00:58:50

Each company charges the price you think your product is worth and no one else is forced to buy, correct? Yes, of course. However, since model 6, (today I have a 6S 128GB) I have deeply frustrating problems with the battery. It's just not right to charge my iPhone 2-3 times every day, since I work with it in the streets and constantly need LTE network. It's FRUSTRATING less then ONE HOUR of usage even with more than 90% of battery capacity. The iOS say that my battery is 84% ​​healthy, but I am sure, that is WRONG. That is FAKE! I live in a small town, and different from Samsung and other brands, I do not have an official repair center close to me. I have to travel over 200km to get to the nearest Apple Store (São Paulo) to get repair. That coast a lot, just like my iPhone. Not nice, Apple, not nice ...

211,"First - if this is not the proper sub to post this, kindly let me know and I will remove it. **TV**: Sony XBR49X800D **Sound bar**: Samsung HW-MS650 I have encountered an issue where my sound bar is not powering on properly with my TV. Please note, the setup was working fine until about a week ago, so I am a bit perplexed as to what caused this issue. Typically, I connect the sound bar to the TV via HDMI ARC (on their respective, designated ARC ports). However, when I turn on the TV, the sound bar defaults to ""D.IN"" and does not advance to ""TV ARC"" as it should. My temporary solution was to unplug and re-plug the TV (power reset), at which time the TV will recognize the sound bar via HDMI ARC (and the bar reads ""TV ARC,"" as it should). However, this only works until I power the TV off again. Lately, this no longer seems to temporarily resolve the issue. It simply does not go past ""D.IN"" and no sound emanates from the unit. The sound bar has been updated recently. My TV's ""sync settings"" that allow HDMI connected devices to power on with the TV are also all enabled. For some reason, the BRAVIA Sync settings main toggle is grayed out, but appeared to be toggled on. (IIRC, it was not grayed out before this issue starting occurring.) Has anyone encountered anything like this previously? It is frustrating because the entire setup was functioning perfectly well until last weekend. Thank you in advance for your insight. *Inputs/outputs* * HDMI ARC out from sound bar to to HDMI ARC on TV * PlayStation 4 - HDMI to TV * SteelSeries USB headset to PS4 *Similar issues*: * [ * [ *Potential solutions* * TV power reset - only works occasionally * Sound bar power reset - does not work * Enable HDMI CEC on the sound bar (suggested by Sony support - not sure how to do this) * use the optical cable (workaround - would prefer HDMI)",2019-02-06 15:40:55

304,"Well, I did some tests today, the Note 9 is just as bad as when I first bought it. This, along with the s8 plus Exynos (not sure about the s9 plus as I haven't used it) are some of the absolute worst optimized phones I've ever used. &amp;#x200B; I currently have 2 other high end samsung devices both of which if we ignore loading times COMPLETELY outperform this pile of junk. These devices are an S8 Snapdragon (NOT plus) and Tab S4 Snapdragon tablet. &amp;#x200B; The scrolling in online apps on this phone is downright AWFUL (this also refers to the s8 plus Exynos. If you're wondering what the story with the S8 plus is and why don't have it, I bought it prior to the note cuz I wanted a bigger screen which I returned because I thought it was faulty and bought the note, both brand new. S8 Plus was from amazon, note 9 was from an official local phone store) First and foremost, the scrolling itself is way too fast, sensitive and the acceleration is downright horrible. You barely touch the screen and it goes flying. Second of all, the way content is loaded is absolutely ridiculous. With almost every app that I tested it on, there were always elements whose frames or placeholders DID NOT load up prior to me reaching them when I start scrolling resulting in jitter when they did load up. Both, my tab s4 and my s8 loaded everything's frames and exact place holders with most apps prior to reaching them. So when I start scrolling it resulted in a much smoother experience with minimal jitter Also the note 9 had LOWER fps than both the s8 and tab s4 when loading up certain apps such as twitter and google playstore and scrolling down at medium speed immediately. Some games also loaded slower on the note 9 as well. &amp;#x200B; The apps I tested today were: *\*\*\* The test was simply open the app, quickly go to its most overloaded page and start scrolling down at a slow - medium rate (loading the apps is ignored because the note 9 wins all of them)* **Twitter Trending / Search page** \- Note 9 - lowest FPS most jitter **Playstore home page** \- Note 9 - lowest FPS most jitter **Netflix home page** \- Note 9 lowest fps, S8 most jitter **Google Chrome wwe, paypal, google search and a few others** \- worst overall performance on the Note 9 **Samsung Browser** \- best performance on the note 9 (pretty much one of the only things that loads up faster and performs faster) **Prime Video** \- lowest FPS on tab s4, most jitter on tab s4 **Reddit Trending page** \- lowest FPS on note 9, most jitter on note 9 &amp;#x200B; I patiently waited for the One UI update just to see if they were going to fix this stupidity but it seems that it never will be. The note 9 and the S8 plus Exynoss have something at their core, whether its their drivers or whatever, it doesn't really matter. Instead of working on a skin for brand new UI, maybe Samsung should actually focus on their hardware and actually test their stuff, not in the way all those clueless phone VS phone youtubers do where they only test the most general stuff - mostly loading times, cameras and battery life. To someone who doesnt own other high end devices this will not be an issue at all or something they notice but to me it is a huge issue. It is not logical or acceptable for a phone that cost me about 50% more than the s8 (when I first bought it) and tab s4 to be performing worse with ANYTHING. It is acceptable for it to be even equal. It should be noticeably faster, smoother etc. with absolutely everything and there is not a single excuse other than absolute laziness, classlessness and lack of knowledge and experience of these so-called developers. &amp;#x200B; I am getting rid of this piece of trash and most likely never purchasing another note or plus phone made by samsung. I'd rather stick with the s8 with the smaller display and no spen rather than wanting to stab myself every time I'm holding my phone. &amp;#x200B; I really don't care what anyone has to say either. This is not bad luck, I've tested other Note 9s, I gave Samsung time and they didn't change a thing. In fact Android Pie I believe has made the phones slower if anything. I really don't give a single F about battery life. Unless you can offer me butter smoother performance I can care less if you're battery lasts a week. And I wouldnt be surprised if this thing Im complaining about is not getting fixed simply to ensure that the plus models and notes get noticeably more battery than the default models.",2019-02-09 09:38:12

However, I honestly don't know what is to come in the Samsung Notes pipeline, so I wanted to post a few questions here. Currently I am using 3.0.1.8. 1. ***Will Samsung Notes have a vector engine?*** Currently, there is a raster engine, and therefore you cannot really zoom in anywhere. I was wondering if they have any plans to convert the raster engine into a vector engine. It would also be great to be able to zoom into places. 2. ***Will it ever support Notes Playback?*** One thing that I really like about Notability on the iPad pro is that you have the ability to write down stuff, while at the same time be able to record your voice. This is really quite interesting because essentially, you can record yourself learning something new. Is this in the works, or is there any plan to introduce this in later versions. 3. ***Can I change the background color?*** I'd really love to be able to change the background of the pages in Samsung Notes. Is this going to be ever possible? Is this a part of their backlog? 4. ***Infinite Canvas support?*** I understand that there is a lot of wisdom in having a fixed width page, but it would be nice to be able to create something on an infinite canvas, especially when drawing a mind-map. I am right now using Sketchbook pro to draw things, and then import them into Samsung Notes, but its not the best way to go about things. 5. ***View Notes Online?*** I would really like to be able to share notes with other people who do not have Samsung Notes. This is a real problem for me right now, because I keep having to share PDFs, that get cut in the middle of nowhere.",2019-02-09 15:38:34

I'm not looking to upgrade cause of the S10 price but if I could get a opportunity to received a discount code through the program that would be bad ass.

456,"Hi guys, sorry for dramatic title. But srsly, is this really true - and why aren’t more people complaining about it? Here in Germany I experience up to 10 times per day using my phone and being interrupted by a fx Telekom network notification popping up and asking me to log onto their paid wifi hotspot. This means I have to just disable wifi whenever I leave my house if I want to use my phone without interruptions. I asked in Samsung Members support, but the reply was that this is not possible to turn off. Any other Android phone can do this, right ? Is this really not an issue to others?",2019-02-13 12:05:27

467,"Previously I've had no issues mirroring my note 9 screen to my Samsung TV using smart view, I would just drag down from the top of the screen and hit my TV name and it would connect. I'm now trying this for the first time since upgrading to OneUI and it just hangs on a pop up connecting box before doing nothing. The two devices are still connected - I am able to turn my TV on and off from this same menu, just not mirror my screen. Any ideas why or help for a fix would be GREATLY appreciated.",2019-02-13 20:04:43
470,"Hi, since I updated my Samsung S9+ recently the adaptive brightness has not been working properly. When I enter a dark environment and want the brightness to be at 5-10%, the adaptive brightness displays that it is lower but the brightness of the screen does not go down. If I manually change the brightness it shows how bright the screen *should* be but as soon as I let go it goes back to 40% even though the dot on the bar is lower than that. If I turn off adaptive brightness and move the brightness low it stays low. I have tried resetting the usage patterns and it has done nothing. Any help would be much appreciated.",2019-02-13 22:36:45

Except I specifically locked it so it wouldn't rotate and this button ends up in the ""enter"" section of the keyboard so I hit it accidentally. How do I turn it off?

480,"A teenage boy doing homework, sitting at a table poking at an iPad propped up with the keyboard case, says ""Mum, what's a computer?"" Mum takes away the iPad and puts a Tab S4 with keyboard and mouse in front of him and says: Well, a computer is a device that allows you to: * Connect a mouse because ""we really feel that the ergonomics ... are that your hands are rested on a surface, and that lifting your arm up to poke a screen is a pretty fatiguing thing to do."" * Plug in a USB drive to copy any files you want on and off. * Set your favourite apps as default for different tasks like web browsing, e-mail, and playing music and videos. * Run multiple apps in resizable windows in desktop mode. * Multitask with any apps you want running in the background. * Manage files and directly share any files between any apps on the device. * Download documents and zip files from any website and extract and edit them with your favourite apps. Then zip them up again for further sharing. * Have multiple user accounts so you can safely share your device with your family members while keeping your own information private. Teenage boy says ""Wow, that's much better than what I was using before, thanks Mum!"" (Dad can be seen in the background the whole time, working on his laptop with a mouse. Little sister is in the background with GearVR playing and having fun.)",2019-02-14 06:48:31

499,Finished setting up NU6950 this morning and placed the new batteries that came with the TV into my remote and noticed immediately that literally for it to do ANYTHING the remote's sensor needs to be inches away from the sensor at the bottom of the TV. Now the remote will not function at all. &amp;#x200B; I've done all the steps to reset the remote but nothing. The TV is still under warranty. Any tips or how can I go about getting replacement? Thanks!,2019-02-14 21:27:23

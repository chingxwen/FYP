9bvwdd,So I found a pair of Gear Icon X and was looking for a replacement case. I looked around and my guess is Samsung doesn’t sell the case alone. I think it’s this year’s version but I’m not completely sure. [Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/YJYd58F) a pic of one of them. I looked on eBay and all I can find is the older case so if anyone can help me out I’d highly appreciate it. ,samsung,2018-08-31 18:03:29
9bwg49,"Hi, I bought my Samsung J5 (2016) in January 2017 and always had this issue where if I lay my phone on a table or my bed with the screen facing up I cant receive WiFi with with as much strength as I would if I had the back part of the phone ""uncovered"", sometimes I cant even get WiFi signal. I even tested this by putting my hand on the back of my J5 and the same happen. I had another Samsung before this one and didnt had this problem. I tried searching for this on other forums but now that im getting more into Reddit I decided to post it here since I always get useful answers. I forgot to mention, but if im close to my router its fine I can rest the phone with the screen facing up, but if I get a little more distant to it I get this issue. And im not even close enough to get bad WiFi reception, since in my bedroom I have a laptop and a console and they've always got good signal.

9bz925,"I honestly think Samsung fanboys are worse than Apple fanboys. There main argument that Samsung is better is that  Apple copies Samsung, yet, there is an entire 120-some page document that Samsung made to copy Apple’s phones and software. They all hate on Apple even though they have never tried an Apple device saying that Samsung phones are just all around better. Some even say that they bought an iPhone X and the Galaxy s9 or another Samsung phone and said it was better, just to make there point more valid. Yet I have never met or heard of anyone that isn’t a popular tech reviewer who would spend around 2000 dollars to get two flagship phones from different brands just to compare them. 
Samsung’s newest flagship the Note9 on paper is a beast compared to the iPhone X, but in everyday use and geek bench scores, the iPhone X is faster. The note 9 has 8Gb of ram, compared to the iPhone X’s 3, yet the iPhone, which will be a year old in September, is still faster. That is because of software optimization, which is lacking in android. iOS isn’t open source, meaning that Apple fine tunes iOS to be the best it can. Also, with iOS, you don’t have to wait 7 centuries for you to get the newest update because Apple made sure they control that. Meanwhile, Samsung phones have to wait for the carrier and a whole bunch of other things before you get the newest update. Brands like Oppo and Huawei are getting the update for Android P yet Samsung, the main oem for Android and the brand people think of when they think of android has no phones confirmed to get the update. It’s kinda ridiculous. The S8 is the oldest phone expected to get the update sometime in the next 5 decades, which is kinda sad considering that the S7 exists and came out only 2 years ago. Yet on iOS, the iPhone 5S is still getting iOS 12. That phone came out in 2013. That’s 5 years ago, yet a 2 year old Samsung phone isn’t getting anymore updates. A child can be born and learn how to walk, and learn how to speak a language and be in there second year of school (in the US) in that span of time. I think you get the idea of how long 5 years actually is. There are also rumours that iPhones like the X and others can start getting updates longer because of how powerful and future proof they are. Yet Samsung phones aren’t even getting more than 2 years worth of updates. Every phone has there flaws, and I am not denying that iPhones and Apple themselves don’t have there flaws, but in my opinion I just think that iPhones and Apple in general are just better. I wanted to do this because I haven’t seen very many people say these different points. Yes, there are posts and videos saying that Apple is better than Samsung and blah blah blah, but I haven’t seen very many things on Samsung fanboys or some of the other stuff I just said. I also don’t hate Samsung by any means, they do a lot of great things and make a lot of great innovations. But they have copied Apple ALOT and you can’t deny that. I have definitely gone off topic because this was originally about Samsung Fanboys and not Samsung Phones etc but whatever. I hope you’ve enjoyed reading this and I encourage you to voice your opinions down in the comments :) ",samsung,2018-09-01 01:24:56

BUG #1

[https://i.imgur.com/vqwhOhv.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vqwhOhv.jpg)

After recieving my Tab S4 and restoring my app from the cloud, a blank app icon appeared in my app drawer. I was able to remove it in the normal Android mode but in Dex mode it appears in my app drawer and is unable to be removed. If I move it to my home screen and click it, i get the message ""Application not installed"". If I long press it, Dex completely crashes and has to restart. When it crashes and asks me to send feedback via the Samsung+ app, that crashes too, so I am unable to actually send a feedback report to Samsung about what is happening.


BUG #2

[https://i.imgur.com/5PLEkjH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5PLEkjH.jpg)

I'm getting another weird bug in Dex mode where text appears above the search box in Google on the Samsung Internet broswer. Happens sometimes  on other websites where typing in a textbox is required. I was able to actually report this bug through the Samsung Internet Beta app, although it happens on both the Beta app and actual release. 


BUG #3

9cectq,"When Samsung released Bixby, They claimed it to be machine learning AI. Thus, as users utilize more and more, it supposed to learn commands and interact with the app easily. However, It was not true. It was bound by certain preset command. 

Bixby was failure. Samsung's VP Lee In Jong, who led development of samsung pay program and bixby, left Samsung after Bixby failure. A lot of report said, Samsung will move development from Korea HQ to SF research center. There were rumor that when US engineers looked into the coding, it was so crappy as in worse than undergrad coding. 

I suppose Samsung started from scratch for Bixby 2.0. However, when it was time to release samsung note 9, It was not probably ready. Bixby 2.0 is more like 0.2. Bixby now cannot even perform finding a direction in google maps, which should be basic of the basic. It lost simple command like taking down note from voice in the reminder.

In conclusion, Bixby became worse than previous trash. All of the review of Galaxy Note 9 claims Bixby is just trash and reason not to buy note 9.

Samsung does not have ability to develop and maintain software properly. Bixby will never catch up to Google assistant because of data and personnel google has.

9ci1g1," So here's the deal. After having the pink line problem in the screen of my galaxy s7 edge, I really wanted a new phone and since I love Samsung, I decided to get the new cool looking Galaxy S8. Now, about a year later I started having problems with my screen again. About 3/4 of my 5.8 inch s8's screen has extremely bad oled burn and the lines have over time started to look kind of pinkish. I have tried every fix the internet has to offer about fixing the screen but nothing works. When looking and asking for the prices of a screen replacement to get rid of it, I only found that the cheapest price in my area was around 279 USD to 350 USD. Spending that kind of money on a replacement for a phone that you can nowdays get for 500 at a bestbuy and such is absolutely mad to me. It is really distracting and watching youtube in full screen has become so annoying and having reddit's white mode is impossible. Since I don't have a job and I am young, there is no way in hell I am able to buy a new s9 or even a 300 dollar phone at this time. What is your opinion on this and I would love to hear other people's stories on this. I am personally feeling really frustrated and since oled burn in is not covered by Samsung or my carrier (Mine is an unlocked) I am left in the dust. I am honestly thinking of buying an iphone with apple care because that should cover it at least.

I bought my note brand new from Samsung for $1400 CAD 3 days ago. Today the volume button jammed and is completely unusable. I bought it back to the store and they said they will not replace it because there is a scratch on the screen (The scratch is another story, like it's supposed to be the best screen on the market, yet I was incredibly careful while waiting on my screen protector, yet it scratches as easy as a peach). Anyway, so they say because of the scratch they will only fix it. Like wth is that about? It's defective, surly they have to replace it? They showed me their policy and it says it has to be brand new for them to exchange. This is hard for me to understand as defects can often take months to show their ugly faces. If the defect takes a while to come through, then the phone will not be in new condition and therefore Samsung never has to replace their defect phones. This is supposed to be a premium product, the best in the world, the best phone ever created, yet here I am having the beg for a replacement phone because they sold me a banger. So what can I do?

I purchased the aforementioned phone on Amazon recently, and attempted to insert my 128GB SD card. I discovered that instead of removing the back cover the only way to get the card in and out was to use the slot on the side, which requires a fine object like a key or needle to get it open.

Since I bought the phone second hand online, I was not provided with any kind of key to get it open. I had to resort to using a needle, but then part of the needle head broke inside the phone and has become impossible to retrieve.

This has now made it very difficult to get the SD card in and out of the phone, as when using a needle I have to be very careful and am worried about damage to the SD card in the process.

Anything I can do here? I am just frustrated with the absolutely awful design of this phone. It is completely unfriendly to anyone who has poor dexterity or is not nimble fingered. If you had certain kinds of disabilities it would be impossible to remove the card. Yet the designers turn a blind eye to this. Why they make it so difficult is beyond me.",samsung,2018-09-03 18:47:31

For a bit more information I pre-ordered it on the 20th which was the last day to order it according to the Samsung website to get it the same day as release. I got the order confirmation on Aug 21st and the customer support line hasn't been too much help aside from telling me there was some problem on their end that they're looking into.

First off, I'm just curious about samsung's updates and how well they are at deploying them. I haven't had a Galaxy phone since the Note 4 back in 2014, so I'm sure things have changed.

I'm trying to find out where I should go next phone wise, because I am not digging the Google Pixel 3XL's notch nonsense and don't really wanna go with LG or Moto since they have pretty poor track records/almost no updates to year old flagships.

So how well does Samsung do? Do they still push out monthly security updates to their S8? Are OS updates timely? Thanks in advance!

I have a UE50F6500 tv with a mainboard problem which causes bootloop.

Now the partnr from this tv's mainboard is BN94-06221J. Now I can get a mainboard with partnr: BN94-06221Y. This mainboard is from a UE50F6640 tv.

The question is will this work in my tv ?

The only difference between the TV's are that the 6640 has local dimming and 600 instead of 400 motion interpolation.

I called tech support a few times got transferred everywhere, par for the course, then was told since the product is defective and brand new to just return it to get a refund. They suggested a refund because it would be faster and said I could order another to be shipped while I was waiting and would get the refund as soon as they got the product back by a certain date. I was like great.

Here is where it all goes wrong. They authorized the return last Thursday but said it had to be back to them by the 13th to get a refund. Well I have to ship it to the US first. Fine but the post office here isn't open til tomorrow because of the holiday. I asked them simply to please extend my return window by a couple of days so that it could get to the US and then to FedEx as they will not accept it if I ship FedEx from my current location.

They gave me a ticket and escalated the request and said to call back. I called back today all prepared to ship the box tomorrow when the post office opens and they didn't even look at my ticket yet. The lady on the phone went to talk to management to get approval to extend by two days. Management says no. She tells them I'm overseas etc, management says no. 

The cheapest shipping rate to get the box from here to my kid in the states in time to get it to Samsung by their required date is 165$. 

So I am currently stuck with a very expensive defective product because unlike every other company I have ever dealt with from here, they are like no. Amazon, sure, Best buy, no problem, Samsung..not happening we don't care.

So for those in a similar situation, do not buy from them directly no matter what kind of a deal you get.

But not today mister, it's all greyed out and saying that it can't connect to my earbuds, while i'm listening to said earbuds for the past hour or so. It's connected to my bluetooth but cannot be detected by the app itself. I tried resetting the buds and re-installing the app, but both did nothing.  


   So I gave up thought that maybe just restarting the phone would do. Ta-da! It worked! it could see my buds again. Few hours later I used the buds again, and sadly it couldn't detect it again, restarted the phone again and boom! now it could be seen again. I need to keep restarting my phone everytime so that the app could see it, not that I really need the app, but it's just annoying when I want to check the battery life on it

9dhgzk,"My Samsung galaxy note 4 which i have had for 3 and a half years had run into some problems last night :-/ While i was just doing my normal activities on my device - all of sudden my screen froze and a red bar formed across it. The device restarted itself and went on to continuously re-boot non stop for a while. Sometimes i would notice the same red bars form across the screen. It would only take me up to the boot logo where i see *Samsung* across it - then the device would freeze once again and have to restart. From here on out - it did just that non stop for as long as it had charge. I tried hard booting it and getting to that menu using the volume up, home and power button but that didn't allow me to get to where i wanted to be at. It simply showed the Android logo and said ""software installing"" after a while it'll once again restart and send me back to restarting the device non-stop during the installation. Then i'll have to remove the battery just to get the thing turned off so it won't be in the boot loop forever. So now i cant access that menu in order to get my device restored or reset. 
I wanted to know where i can go on to fix this problem from here? I've seen online guides talking about how i can install the software from a PC and get my device fixed in case this is a software related problem. Others say it could be related with the ageing of my device and problems like this are eventually bound to happen. But anyway, any recommendations as to what i can do now and how i can deal with this error without actual tech support and all that? I wouldn't mind having to lose all my data either and i do have access to a PC if i'll need one.",samsung,2018-09-06 11:16:09

I have two Samsung fast charger blocks that both still work outside of my phone and my phone still chargers using non Samsung chargers as well as wireless charging. 

No one from Verizon was able to help me fix the problem as well as another phone fixing store. No one has heard of this happening. Curious to see if anyone on here has ever experienced this.

I am not getting a new phone in maybe 2-3 years and the fact that I have to deal with this and Samsung won't fix it beyond me. And before people tell me that it is my fault I would like to remind you that Oled displays have a known flaw of screen burn in and in a technical sense is a flaw in the display. I am calling Samsung support tomorrow to try to get my phone fixed and I'll update soon.

This is something that happens with GoodLock and all of those changes too, you can make your quick access control area look different in really cool ways, but you still get bland white box standard Samsung notifications... And this bugs me because it's immediately no longer consistent and it looks awful

I just wish Samsung would give us a few more options on what our drop down notification centre looks like, including the notifications themselves... For example, simple options like changing notifications to floating rounded rectangles like stock Android P has, options to choose some base colours, maybe options to slightly alter transparency, and have all of these changes affect the whole look so it's consistently applied and you're not receiving white notifications on a black drop down notification centre 

Thoughts? Or is it just me?

9eey88,"  

**8/10**  Pre-ordered my 512 Note 9, lavender purple, unlocked, purchased from Samsung.com, right after being notified that I could. Chose the ATK headphones for promotional item, and purchased a single fast-charging wireless charger.

**8/11-8/21** Watched many YouTube videos and scanned numerous Reddit threads and various other online feeds about the Note 9 in anticipation of receiving mine. Don’t pretend like some of you didn’t do the very same thing. 

8/22  Received my beautiful 512 Note 9, lavender purple, unlocked, purchased from Samsung.com. Excited, of course.  Already bought two phone cases and the Whitestone Dome screen protector.  That's how excited.  Opened the box, turned on the phone…..the screen had a faint line on the left side running from top to bottom of the phone. My excitement dimmed. Went online to see if anyone else had the issue and/how to fix it, and sure enough someone else said they experienced the same thing and after restarting their phone, the line went away. So, I did the same thing and sure enough, the line went away. Assuming the issue was fixed, I installed my Whitestone screen protector and used Smart Switch to transfer data/info from old phone (that I used for my trade-in). Boxed up my trade-in phone and sent it back using the return label/box.

**8/23**  Read more online comments about Note 9 screen bleeds and other issues people were having right out of the box, so I called Samsung.com customer service right away in the morning (8:25am), and talked to four different people (Luis, Sasha, Ronna, and Melissa) in just over two hours; I was bounced from one department to another (I was even sent to the warranty department and issued a ticket at one point) and eventually transferred back to customer service. I explained to each of them that I wanted to exchange my phone because it was defective right out of the box and I didn't want to take any chances since I spent so much. What I was told (and Samsung records all their calls, so if anyone has access to those, I urge you to listen to them, because their customer service personnel are awful and knowledgeable) that Samsung “doesn’t do” exchanges, they only issue returns. And I would need to return all my items from the order, including the free promotional ATK headphones and the fast wireless charger I purchased. Once I returned it, I could create another order through the website (Samsung.com), and when I received THAT new phone, I would need to call and request a code to order promotional headphones, or whatever promotional item they had available. 

I explained to Samsung.com customer service that I was unable to send them the phone back because I just sent them my back-up phone for the trade-in, so I would be without a phone until they sent me one; and since the phone I ordered was on backorder, it wouldn’t be until October until they could send me one. Talking to Melissa (10:42am of this call), she suggested that I call FedEx to have them stop the return of my back-up phone, and when I got that one back, go ahead and proceed with my Note 9 return. Frustrated of course, I said I’ll give that a try, and she issued return labels for me to send back my defective Note 9, which are good until 9/7, so that should be enough time to get my phone back and transfer the data/info again and send my new Note 9 back.

**8/24 - 8/27** Fedex wasn’t accommodating….at all. Called Samsung.com customer service (8/27 2:12pm) and talked to Diana. After explaining my situation, I’m noticing that these agents are focusing on how I don’t want to send back my promotional item (which I said I didn’t want to because I got it for pre-ordering), and their tone is accusational (not a real word, but I mean it felt like they were accusing me of pre-ordering JUST to get the promotional item and then just keep it or something), but I do my best to explain that ““I’m the customer and I received a product that was defective right out of the box, and I thought just restarting it would fix it, and it seemed to, so I put the most expensive protective screen on it, but it’s a few days later, and the line is back on the screen and even darker than before, and I’m just trying to get a non-defective phone without a bunch of hassle, and nobody seems to understand that I don’t have a back-up phone, and getting one will cost even more money, and you’re trying to make me jump through a bunch of hoops just to fix something that should’ve been as easy as, “No problem, ma’am, we’ll send you a new phone and you just send us back the defective one in the box and return label we provide you”….THAT’S how the initial conversation should’ve gone!”” How the conversation went: I was that person on the phone just rambling my frustrations to a very-new customer service employee who probably just started their shift twelve minutes earlier, and they couldn’t help me nor could they transfer me to their manager because they were on the phone with another customer. I said I’d call back the next day.

**8/28** Called Samsung.com customer service after work (4:03pm) and talked to a seemingly-helpful young lady who listened to my situation and said she understood how frustrating it must be, getting a defective phone and now not being able to send it back because I don’t have a back-up phone. She let me vent about how UN-customer-service-like it is to put all the fix-the-situation effort back onto the customer rather than have the vendor apologize for the defective phone and make it right. She said she would escalate my ticket and someone from that department would email me within 24 hours and I could converse directly with them to fix it.

**8/30** Called Samsung.com customer service (used my work phone, so I don’t have the actual time, but it was before lunch) to check on the escalated ticket, and the young man said it could take up to 72 hours for an escalated ticket to be responded to. So I wait.

**9/6** Called Samsung customer service (11:08am) Talked to a male representative and explained that the return label I have for returning my defective Note 9 expires tomorrow and I still haven’t heard from this “escalated team” from last week, and I’ve been very patient with them, and he responds by saying that he doesn’t see a request for an escalated ticket, so I correct him with the details of the date and time the ticket was requested and he said that his screen doesn’t show that, so I asked to talk to his supervisor. He placed me on hold a bunch of times, each time letting me know that his supervisor is on the phone with another customer. He finally answers and tells me that his supervisor is still on the phone, but he’ll have them call me back within an hour. Before hanging up, I confirmed that he had my correct phone number. Over three hours later, I hadn’t received any calls, so I call “customer service” again (2:28pm). First I spoke to a female representative and explained my urgent situation with the expiring return labels, but she was unable to help me, so I asked to speak with her supervisor and was put on hold several times. She got back on the phone with me every 5 minutes to let me know that she was still there, and I told her that I appreciated her checking back with me. Her supervisor,  “Melissa out of the Toronto Canada call center”, finally was on the phone and I again explained the urgency of the situation, and she said she would request an extension to have someone issue new return labels. Since she was a “supervisor” I asked her a bunch of questions about my situation and why I just wasn’t able to get my defective phone replaced, and her rote response was that it wasn’t Samsung’s policy. I wish I would’ve recorded at least this last call because it just floored me with her demeanor. I felt like she didn’t understand why I was so frustrated. I mean, I summarized my experience for her and she didn’t seem to understand what my issue was with just sending back my whole order; she kept responding with, “Samsung doesn’t have an exchange process, they only have a return process.” If I wanted to keep my pre-order promotional item, I would need to use the warranty, which is a different company.  I asked her to confirm that the request was made for the return-label extension and then hung up.

The next morning, I got an email from their return-label extension dept:

*Jennifer B. (Samsung E-Commerce)*

*Sep 7, 10:05 EDT*

*Good Morning XXXXXXX,*   
*I am contacting you regarding your Samsung.com order, xxxxxxx. I understand that you are requesting a return label for the defective Note 9 that you had received. Unfortunately, we are unable to issue a new return label at this time being that one had already been sent to you. I have resent this return label to your email address,* [*xx725@gmail.com*](mailto:jxx725@gmail.com) *and the deadline to have this product sent out is today, September 7, 2018 to prevent rejection by the warehouse.*

**9/9**  So, that’s Samsung.com’s customer service. A combination of “Sorry, not sorry” and “Figure it out for yourself” and “We don’t really know what we’re doing” and “You’re not a customer, you’re just a ticket number with these fragmented notes on my screen that 14 different reps have input over the course of two weeks”.. 

As a long-time Samsung.com customer (S6, S7, S7 Edge, Note 8, S9+), I guess I can be glad that this is the first and last time I’ll ever have to deal with Samsung.com customer service. All my other phones arrived without defect and the trade-ins went without issue. But this experience has left me with a different perspective of the whole Samsung company and I won’t be buying any more of their products until the frustration wears off. Which really stinks because I had plans to do some serious Christmas gifts this year. 

Needless to say, I’m going to have to invest in a temporary phone to use and contact the warranty people. Yep, I’m going to use the one-time warranty on a phone that came out of the box defective. Perhaps I’ll get lucky and never need the warranty for anything else. In other news, I found some YouTube videos that demonstrate being reeeeeeally careful to remove the Whitestone screen protector in order to re-apply it…so I might not have to buy another one of those. Here’s to maybe having a silver lining in all of this.

9egrbd,"So I broke my Samsung S8 display a while back and today I finally swallowed up the fact that im going to go and spend half the money i spent on the phone for a new display, and i decided to get to a Samsung Support Centre to get it fixed. I went there, waited for an hour and finally got called up to talk to the staff.

I explained my problem and he said it needed a new display, which I knew, so I agreed on the fee of £220 and he started taking information about the phone (serial numbers, model number)

A couple of minutes later he came back to me and said that my phone was sold in the United Arab Emirates (I'm from the UK) and that the parts and layout of the phone was different to those of the European Model and they didn't have the parts in stock

This was kind of a bummer but what can you do?, he'll order in some parts and I'll come back in a week or two to get it repaired then right? Wrong. He told me that he was unable to get the parts I required and my only option was to either contact  Samsung international and hope they do something or go to UAE myself.

This is absolutely ridiculous, the fact that I spent a  lot of money on this phone, and the fact that I'm willing to spend half of what I payed for the phone for a display is already insane enough, but now they can't even ship over a display for my phone?

It doesn't matter where the hell my phone originated from, Samsung is Samsung and it should care about it's customers enough to send me parts for my phone if I require them. It's like going to repair your car. It doesn't matter where the car is from, if the customer needs a part that the mechanic doesn't have, they will order it into their repair centre in order to fix the car. I don't see why Samsung is an exception.

I've chosen to spend my money (and a lot of it) on Samsung, not Apple, not Google, they should be there to fulfil my concerns and needs, especially when I'm throwing £220 in their face. Now I'm left with a cracked display that doesn't display a quarter of the screen when I play videos and has green and black bars all over it. Nice.

1 - While running, I can't seem to be able to use the watch at all. It's hard to explain but I can't interact with it hardly at all without it going into some kinda sleep mode or the screen dimming out again. I've left the always on display at ""on"". Is there a way of having the watch fully awake while running so I don't have to raise the phone right up to my face to see what's happening on screen?

2 - Is Spotify meant to be garbage? I've had numerous issues. It won't let me download playlists unless I'm on WiFi which makes sense, but it won't connect to my WiFi unless I manually turn Bluetooth off. Is this normal? 

3 - When I do have music playing via Bluetooth headphones and I use the usual skip track function on the headphones themselves it sometimes skips to my next song but most of the time it skips it to some default Samsung type tone which is obviously preinstalled on the watch. So annoying! Is this an issue with the watch or headphones? I've been able to use the same function on the same headphones on my phone with zero issues. 

4 - Spotify is a huge battery drain. Luckily the watch warns me about this after a run etc. How can I manually close Spotify without being prompted?

5 - If I get sent a picture on WhatsApp it sometimes shows the actual picture on my phone screen but sometimes doesn't at all. Why would this be?

A little bit of backstory. When I first got the phone, I instantly switched the resolution to 1440P and installed all my apps I needed. My worst screen on time from 100% to 1-2% was 2 hours and 40 minutes. I was getting a galaxy S6 vibe from back in the day when my old S6 was lasting really badly.

I was on **ARCA** firmware and stuff was going down the drain real fast. 1000 elements in camera folder, 29 apps. I was constantly getting 3 hours and a half of SoT, in the better days 4. I then moved to BRG6 firmware and things started looking up. I hit 5 hours SoT once and with my usual usage I got about 20-30 minutes more compared to ARCA. One redditor told me to move to BRGA and oh boy.

**BRGA** changed my *whole* S9+ experience from a buyers remorse to a loving relationship between one guy and his phone. With even more photos and 30+ apps I was getting on average half an hour of SoT more compared to BRG6. Even more, the performance of the device went UP. It felt even more fluid.

After a full reset, disabling the samsung infinity display, sitting on 1080p, disabling the antivirus, keeping half the apps... I'm constantly getting between 5 hours and 6 hours of SoT and the phone is breezy, literally breezy.

**TL;DR**: Ever since I got the phone(exynos variant), I fucking hated it's battery life and the fact that it was hanging, completely randomly freezing and so forth. It's last ""BRGA"" update made the whole phone experience worthwhile, getting constantly between 5 and 6 hours SoT and the performance of the device went up a whole level.",samsung,2018-09-11 22:43:00

I also use Google/Samsung pay all the time and that's why i have the NFC ON all the time.

Many apps (google maps, weather app, some widgets....)  need an access to the GPS and that's why i have GPS ON all the time.

I'm afraid of losing some data on my phone and that's why i have the data sync ON all the time.

Mobile data also always ON as its my main access to the internet so i have to keep it on all the time.

Finally I'm using Samsung Galaxy Note 8 at the moment and the main reason why i bought it is the gorgeous super amoled display, so the display is on QHD and i love the always on display so ... yes it is also ON all the time.


All these features are highly needed for every day use (at least for me), its 2018 after all, so i keep all things i need ON all the time !!!!

I play some games as clash of clans, clash royal, flow free ..... (not heavy games).

As expected my battery life can't always keep up till the end of the day ( but sometimes it actually does).

What i mean is: all we are living in an amazing time when the computers became so small that they actually fit in our pockets, they became so powerful that they often can replace our laptops and PCs, so i don't care about the battery life i care only about getting the maximum benefit out of it.

As you know there is really good and small power banks these days, wireless charging and fast charging technology that can help me and my phone to get through the day.

Thinking all the time only about the battery is really so sad.

Just think about it: we all buy NOT cheap super smartphones, we all look to their specs before buying them, we all need the highest end specs and technology, we all want the best phone with the maximum number of features in it ....... and sadly after buying it we:

1. Turn on power saving mode, that means: less CPU power, less GPU power, slower performance, less brightness, it also limits background processes which may affect  the whole performance of some apps and may cuz a delay in receiving some notifications from some apps and may also cuz a sync delay in some apps like ""Gmail ......... etc.), finally the power saving mode on my note 8 also recommends to turn off always on display ........

2. Turn off bluetooth: why the heck i need a truly wirless earbuds if i have to turn on and off bluetooth every time i want to use them !_!

2. Turn off GPS

3. Turn off NFC

4. Turn off sync !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

5. Finally we sometimes turn of wifi when its not needed.

Why the heck we are paying a 600-1000$ for a smartphone if we knowingly limiting its performance to a budget phone level??

 Just to save some battery juice !!!!

So I've been a Samsung user for the past few years starting with the S4 and then the S6. 

And I recently got my S9+ (256 GB) last Wednesday after ordering it 2 weeks ago from Samsung. I decided to upgrade because of the $100 discount offer on all unlocked phones ordered through Samsung or Amazon. 

Anyways getting straight to the point, this is my first device with the always on display feature. 

And I've noticed that the AOD doesn't move just like on the S7 or S8. Where it shifts every minute to avoid screen burn in. 

So can anyone tell me what's going on? And how to fix it? I'm on Android Oreo if you're wondering. 

Also I'm worried about a screen burn in, because I just got this phone and it cost me a lot of money. So I'm trying to keep like brand new. Thanks in advance ",samsung,2018-09-13 01:36:16

The error is triggered by sliding a finger up or down on the screen

Sliding down hides app menu.

9gnf9z,"Hey Guys!

I am currently in the process of trying to buy a Samsung Note 9 from the online store.  They are running an amazing promotion to get a Fast Wireless Charger and S3 Frontier Watch for an extra $99...amazing, right?!

Except, I've been trying to buy it on their online store since Saturday evening, and am completely unable to do so thus far.  

Background:  I am moving across the country soon, and I want to trade my Pixel 2 XL in for a Samsung phone as it is far more reliable.  I have both this Pixel and an iPhone 8 which is my work phone.  When I need a reliable phone, I always reach for my iPhone.  I want to stay in the android world, as I have made many app purchases on google play that I don't want to buy twice at the apple store.  

When I first tried to buy the Note9 with the promotion on their site, it wouldn't add the watch to my order.  Chat supports only answer was ""clear your web cache.""  I had already tried 2 different computers, several web browsers, and even the Samsung shop app on my phone. 

The second issue, after they resolved the first, is that they were unable to get the 24mo financing option to work upon checkout for the Note9 specifically. 

After all this, I decided to say fuck it, and ordered the phone in cash with my debit card.  After ordering, it showed that the phone was backordered.  Since I am on a time crunch,  I could not afford to wait for the backorder.  I called support and they told me that it was yet again another issue with the online store and that it was not actually backordered.  They told me that I would have to cancel my order and submit a new one.  Only one problem,  I don't have another fucking 1000+ dollars to spend right this moment until the original order hold on my account is lifted.  

All in all, this has been a terrible experience.  As of right now, 24mo financing is still not working.  They told me to go to a local Best Buy and speak with a Samsung rep to sort the issue out for me,  but the two best buy samsung reps told me I was SOL basically. 

Also, Samsung support has no ability to order a phone online for you on your behalf, so I have to deal with the online store that doesn't even work!

It might not be a huge issue for those that do not use the Tab S4 to play games, but it is sucking the enjoyment out of almost every game I've played so far. I've looked around on the Internet, and found several users with the same problems too. On XDA, 5ch, and Twitter (mostly Japanese).

I'm hoping it's just a software issue (errorneous touch prevention or filtering) that can be fixed, and hopefully not a hardware limitation.


Example: Frequently when I tap or hold 2 points on the screen, the tablet ignores those inputs. Swiping/flicking across the screen also results in spotty input detection, and using moving 2 fingers on the screen results in huge input delay.


I've contacted Samsung Customer Service, and they provided the standard procedures, of which nothing helped. DMed by country's Samsung twitter and was ignored. Posted and error log on Samsung Members and was ignored too. I'm currently at a loss here, I don't know if I should keep the tablet and keep hoping Samsung releases a fix for it.

Back during the launch of the Galaxy S9, I bought a base model from them on their website and financed it via Samsung Pay (which uses TD Bank). I had opted to trade in my iPhone 7 to receive a $300 credit. Well, I received the phone a tad earlier in the mail a couple days before worldwide launch and I was super excited. I took it out set it up and went about my merry way with my new beautiful phone. Well, battery life turned out to not be what I expected. Coming from my iPhone 7, I was used to a few days of battery and I could charge it on my way to work if needed. With the S9, it was dead by the next morning. I'm not going to say the phone sucks or the battery was bad, but it was objectively worse than my previous phone and that didn't work for me when considering how little time I have access to a charger. Because of this, I contacted support with this reasoning and a successful return was initiated.





Jump forward to me sending the S9 back. I had packed all necessary cables (the charger block, the charger cable, and the headphones), the phone itself in its still pristine condition, and even all documentation (including the little SIM tray key). I send it back in the box and I get an email that Samsung received it on April 26th. Okay, weird that it took so long to get it received and processed, but whatever. 






Well, literally one day outside of the return window closing, they send me an email saying that my return was unsuccessful and that the phone was being shipped back. I was extremely confused because my return was shipped with receipt within the return window and was in factory condition with ALL included accessories inside the original box. Not according to them. This was the reasoning: ""Either product has physical damage (or) return received outside of returns window (or) return is missing parts (or) return not in OEM box.""





I was confused and thought that I maybe messed up and waited for the phone in the mail. I get the phone, take it out and EVERYTHING IS THERE. I didn't understand why it was rejected. All parts were there, the phone was without a scratch and worked just fine (tested to be sure). Nothing was wrong. I get angry because someone didn't do their due diligence and I contact support in a respectful manner. I tell them this and they give the go-ahead on a 30-day extension of the return window and ask me to send it back in. So, I do. Fast forward to the close of that return window, I get the SAME email. Same response. Same reasoning: ""Either product has physical damage (or) return received outside of returns window (or) return is missing parts (or) return not in OEM box.""







I was pissed, but I thought ""okay fine, I'll just sell the phone and use it to pay back the credit line for the phone."" I waited for the phone. I waited and waited. It never came back. Okay, maybe it'll take a bit to get back. Maybe something happened.






So, I wait. I wait some more. I finally contact customer support over the website IM chat and ask if they still have my phone and they do. I ask to please look into the phone box and validate what is in the box and the state of the phone because it will be immediately resolve if someone just looked in the box. I ask this again and again a few times a week. The same answer is given that they are looking into it and ""nothing from the warehouse was posted yet."" Okay, fine. I ease off a bit and wait. Still nothing. 






At this point, I go for plan B: just give me back the phone. It was clear they didn't want to refund me so I asked for the phone back on June 26th in an email with support. I told them in no uncertain terms: ""Please ship the phone in its included box and accessories back to me. Thank you.""






Since then, there has been no effort made to get the phone back. I have literally called almost every other day at some points and every week at other points. I have even stopped for a couple weeks to see if anything would start moving. Nothing. I call every week and get the same answer ""it's lost in the warehouse, it needs to be validated."" I ask why they didn't ship back to me and they say ""well it was marked to ship back to you, did you not receive it?"" I say no. They look into it further and receive NO SHIPPING # WAS EVER POSTED, meaning no shipment to me was ever made. I also know this because I have it set up with the shipping services to notify me when something is being shipped to my address. I never got that notification.





So I have two different things proving that nothing was ever shipped. They claim that it's lost in the warehouse. No matter how much I call and ask, no matter how respectful or confrontational I am, and no matter how much time has passed, it is ALWAYS ""lost in the warehouse."" It has been this way for months and it is now September 18.






So, in short, I am paying for a phone that I have not had since MAY (4 months) because Samsung lost it. They refuse a refund still. They refuse to send me a new phone. I have been effectively screwed out of the full price of a Galaxy S9. 





You can bet that I will no longer recommend Samsung and will no longer buy any more products or services from them. But anyways, does anyone know what else I can do? I've bothered them via chat, email, and phone for 4 months now and nothing has been done. I can't do charge-backs because it's from a credit line through their service.

My phone is always in my pocket with the screen facing my leg and the aux/charging port facing towards the opening of the pocket. I pulled my phone out and I have a pea sized shatter right below the middle and a little bit to the left of the curve of the display. It has smaller hairline cracks spreading throughout the screen that are nearly invisible on the display.

I accept that I most likely rubbed the phone against the side of the chair which has a bit of metal and stuff. I'm wondering what my options are. Does Samsung/AT&amp;T offer screen repairs for the Note 9 yet? Would a third party store like iFixIt be able to repair my phone?

With the release of the XS and the XS Max, I'm done. I'm fed up with the pricing structure and with the marginal upgrades. I'm your typical angry tech nerd. I'm fed up with the lack of perceived freedom. I'm tired of blah blah blah.

I've tried breaking free before with an S6, an S9, and an LG G4. But every time, I end up back on iOS because of a couple of reasons:

1. iMessage is baller, especially with my kids. Sharing pics and videos is the best. And being able to message from my work computer without having to pick up my phone.
2. The Find My Friends feature is a security necessity with my kids. I know where they are at all times, which is a bit draconic on my part, but is something that, living in the Atlanta Metro area, I believe is key.
3. iOS just...works. Across all my devices.

9bvwdd,So I found a pair of Gear Icon X and was looking for a replacement case. I looked around and my guess is Samsung doesn’t sell the case alone. I think it’s this year’s version but I’m not completely sure. [Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/YJYd58F) a pic of one of them.

9bwg49,"Hi, I bought my Samsung J5 (2016) in January 2017 and always had this issue where if I lay my phone on a table or my bed with the screen facing up I cant receive WiFi with with as much strength as I would if I had the back part of the phone ""uncovered"", sometimes I cant even get WiFi signal. I even tested this by putting my hand on the back of my J5 and the same happen. I had another Samsung before this one and didnt had this problem. I tried searching for this on other forums but now that im getting more into Reddit I decided to post it here since I always get useful answers. I forgot to mention, but if im close to my router its fine I can rest the phone with the screen facing up, but if I get a little more distant to it I get this issue.

9bz925,"I honestly think Samsung fanboys are worse than Apple fanboys. There main argument that Samsung is better is that  Apple copies Samsung, yet, there is an entire 120-some page document that Samsung made to copy Apple’s phones and software. They all hate on Apple even though they have never tried an Apple device saying that Samsung phones are just all around better. Some even say that they bought an iPhone X and the Galaxy s9 or another Samsung phone and said it was better, just to make there point more valid. Yet I have never met or heard of anyone that isn’t a popular tech reviewer who would spend around 2000 dollars to get two flagship phones from different brands just to compare them. 
Samsung’s newest flagship the Note9 on paper is a beast compared to the iPhone X, but in everyday use and geek bench scores, the iPhone X is faster. The note 9 has 8Gb of ram, compared to the iPhone X’s 3, yet the iPhone, which will be a year old in September, is still faster. That is because of software optimization, which is lacking in android. iOS isn’t open source, meaning that Apple fine tunes iOS to be the best it can. Also, with iOS, you don’t have to wait 7 centuries for you to get the newest update because Apple made sure they control that. Meanwhile, Samsung phones have to wait for the carrier and a whole bunch of other things before you get the newest update. Brands like Oppo and Huawei are getting the update for Android P yet Samsung, the main oem for Android and the brand people think of when they think of android has no phones confirmed to get the update. It’s kinda ridiculous. The S8 is the oldest phone expected to get the update sometime in the next 5 decades, which is kinda sad considering that the S7 exists and came out only 2 years ago. Yet on iOS, the iPhone 5S is still getting iOS 12. That phone came out in 2013. That’s 5 years ago, yet a 2 year old Samsung phone isn’t getting anymore updates. A child can be born and learn how to walk, and learn how to speak a language and be in there second year of school (in the US) in that span of time. I think you get the idea of how long 5 years actually is. There are also rumours that iPhones like the X and others can start getting updates longer because of how powerful and future proof they are. Yet Samsung phones aren’t even getting more than 2 years worth of updates. Every phone has there flaws, and I am not denying that iPhones and Apple themselves don’t have there flaws, but in my opinion I just think that iPhones and Apple in general are just better. I wanted to do this because I haven’t seen very many people say these different points. Yes, there are posts and videos saying that Apple is better than Samsung and blah blah blah, but I haven’t seen very many things on Samsung fanboys or some of the other stuff I just said. I also don’t hate Samsung by any means, they do a lot of great things and make a lot of great innovations. But they have copied Apple ALOT and you can’t deny that. I have definitely gone off topic because this was originally about Samsung Fanboys and not Samsung Phones etc but whatever. I hope you’ve enjoyed reading this and I encourage you to voice your opinions down in the comments :) ",samsung,2018-09-01 01:24:56

BUG #1

[https://i.imgur.com/vqwhOhv.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vqwhOhv.jpg)

After recieving my Tab S4 and restoring my app from the cloud, a blank app icon appeared in my app drawer. I was able to remove it in the normal Android mode but in Dex mode it appears in my app drawer and is unable to be removed. If I move it to my home screen and click it, i get the message ""Application not installed"". If I long press it, Dex completely crashes and has to restart. When it crashes and asks me to send feedback via the Samsung+ app, that crashes too, so I am unable to actually send a feedback report to Samsung about what is happening.


BUG #2

[https://i.imgur.com/5PLEkjH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5PLEkjH.jpg)

I'm getting another weird bug in Dex mode where text appears above the search box in Google on the Samsung Internet broswer. Happens sometimes  on other websites where typing in a textbox is required. I was able to actually report this bug through the Samsung Internet Beta app, although it happens on both the Beta app and actual release. 


BUG #3

9cectq,"When Samsung released Bixby, They claimed it to be machine learning AI. Thus, as users utilize more and more, it supposed to learn commands and interact with the app easily. However, It was not true. It was bound by certain preset command. 

Bixby was failure. Samsung's VP Lee In Jong, who led development of samsung pay program and bixby, left Samsung after Bixby failure. A lot of report said, Samsung will move development from Korea HQ to SF research center. There were rumor that when US engineers looked into the coding, it was so crappy as in worse than undergrad coding. 

I suppose Samsung started from scratch for Bixby 2.0. However, when it was time to release samsung note 9, It was not probably ready. Bixby 2.0 is more like 0.2. Bixby now cannot even perform finding a direction in google maps, which should be basic of the basic. It lost simple command like taking down note from voice in the reminder.

In conclusion, Bixby became worse than previous trash. All of the review of Galaxy Note 9 claims Bixby is just trash and reason not to buy note 9.

Samsung does not have ability to develop and maintain software properly. Bixby will never catch up to Google assistant because of data and personnel google has.

9ci1g1," So here's the deal. After having the pink line problem in the screen of my galaxy s7 edge, I really wanted a new phone and since I love Samsung, I decided to get the new cool looking Galaxy S8. Now, about a year later I started having problems with my screen again. About 3/4 of my 5.8 inch s8's screen has extremely bad oled burn and the lines have over time started to look kind of pinkish. I have tried every fix the internet has to offer about fixing the screen but nothing works. When looking and asking for the prices of a screen replacement to get rid of it, I only found that the cheapest price in my area was around 279 USD to 350 USD. Spending that kind of money on a replacement for a phone that you can nowdays get for 500 at a bestbuy and such is absolutely mad to me. It is really distracting and watching youtube in full screen has become so annoying and having reddit's white mode is impossible. Since I don't have a job and I am young, there is no way in hell I am able to buy a new s9 or even a 300 dollar phone at this time. What is your opinion on this and I would love to hear other people's stories on this. I am personally feeling really frustrated and since oled burn in is not covered by Samsung or my carrier (Mine is an unlocked) I am left in the dust.

I bought my note brand new from Samsung for $1400 CAD 3 days ago. Today the volume button jammed and is completely unusable. I bought it back to the store and they said they will not replace it because there is a scratch on the screen (The scratch is another story, like it's supposed to be the best screen on the market, yet I was incredibly careful while waiting on my screen protector, yet it scratches as easy as a peach). Anyway, so they say because of the scratch they will only fix it. Like wth is that about? It's defective, surly they have to replace it? They showed me their policy and it says it has to be brand new for them to exchange. This is hard for me to understand as defects can often take months to show their ugly faces. If the defect takes a while to come through, then the phone will not be in new condition and therefore Samsung never has to replace their defect phones. This is supposed to be a premium product, the best in the world, the best phone ever created, yet here I am having the beg for a replacement phone because they sold me a banger. So what can I do?

I purchased the aforementioned phone on Amazon recently, and attempted to insert my 128GB SD card. I discovered that instead of removing the back cover the only way to get the card in and out was to use the slot on the side, which requires a fine object like a key or needle to get it open.

Since I bought the phone second hand online, I was not provided with any kind of key to get it open. I had to resort to using a needle, but then part of the needle head broke inside the phone and has become impossible to retrieve.

This has now made it very difficult to get the SD card in and out of the phone, as when using a needle I have to be very careful and am worried about damage to the SD card in the process.

Anything I can do here? I am just frustrated with the absolutely awful design of this phone. It is completely unfriendly to anyone who has poor dexterity or is not nimble fingered. If you had certain kinds of disabilities it would be impossible to remove the card. Yet the designers turn a blind eye to this. Why they make it so difficult is beyond me.",samsung,2018-09-03 18:47:31

First off, I'm just curious about samsung's updates and how well they are at deploying them. I haven't had a Galaxy phone since the Note 4 back in 2014, so I'm sure things have changed.

I'm trying to find out where I should go next phone wise, because I am not digging the Google Pixel 3XL's notch nonsense and don't really wanna go with LG or Moto since they have pretty poor track records/almost no updates to year old flagships.

So how well does Samsung do? Do they still push out monthly security updates to their S8? Are OS updates timely? Thanks in advance!

I have a UE50F6500 tv with a mainboard problem which causes bootloop.

Now the partnr from this tv's mainboard is BN94-06221J. Now I can get a mainboard with partnr: BN94-06221Y. This mainboard is from a UE50F6640 tv.

The question is will this work in my tv ?

The only difference between the TV's are that the 6640 has local dimming and 600 instead of 400 motion interpolation.

I called tech support a few times got transferred everywhere, par for the course, then was told since the product is defective and brand new to just return it to get a refund. They suggested a refund because it would be faster and said I could order another to be shipped while I was waiting and would get the refund as soon as they got the product back by a certain date. I was like great.

Here is where it all goes wrong. They authorized the return last Thursday but said it had to be back to them by the 13th to get a refund. Well I have to ship it to the US first. Fine but the post office here isn't open til tomorrow because of the holiday. I asked them simply to please extend my return window by a couple of days so that it could get to the US and then to FedEx as they will not accept it if I ship FedEx from my current location.

They gave me a ticket and escalated the request and said to call back. I called back today all prepared to ship the box tomorrow when the post office opens and they didn't even look at my ticket yet. The lady on the phone went to talk to management to get approval to extend by two days. Management says no. She tells them I'm overseas etc, management says no. 

The cheapest shipping rate to get the box from here to my kid in the states in time to get it to Samsung by their required date is 165$. 

So I am currently stuck with a very expensive defective product because unlike every other company I have ever dealt with from here, they are like no. Amazon, sure, Best buy, no problem, Samsung..not happening we don't care.

So for those in a similar situation, do not buy from them directly no matter what kind of a deal you get.

But not today mister, it's all greyed out and saying that it can't connect to my earbuds, while i'm listening to said earbuds for the past hour or so.

   So I gave up thought that maybe just restarting the phone would do. Ta-da! It worked! it could see my buds again. Few hours later I used the buds again, and sadly it couldn't detect it again, restarted the phone again and boom! now it could be seen again. I need to keep restarting my phone everytime so that the app could see it, not that I really need the app, but it's just annoying when I want to check the battery life on it

9dhgzk,"My Samsung galaxy note 4 which i have had for 3 and a half years had run into some problems last night :-/ While i was just doing my normal activities on my device - all of sudden my screen froze and a red bar formed across it. The device restarted itself and went on to continuously re-boot non stop for a while. Sometimes i would notice the same red bars form across the screen. It would only take me up to the boot logo where i see *Samsung* across it - then the device would freeze once again and have to restart. From here on out - it did just that non stop for as long as it had charge. I tried hard booting it and getting to that menu using the volume up, home and power button but that didn't allow me to get to where i wanted to be at. It simply showed the Android logo and said ""software installing"" after a while it'll once again restart and send me back to restarting the device non-stop during the installation. Then i'll have to remove the battery just to get the thing turned off so it won't be in the boot loop forever. So now i cant access that menu in order to get my device restored or reset. 
I wanted to know where i can go on to fix this problem from here? I've seen online guides talking about how i can install the software from a PC and get my device fixed in case this is a software related problem. Others say it could be related with the ageing of my device and problems like this are eventually bound to happen. But anyway, any recommendations as to what i can do now and how i can deal with this error without actual tech support and all that? I wouldn't mind having to lose all my data either and i do have access to a PC if i'll need one.",samsung,2018-09-06 11:16:09

This is something that happens with GoodLock and all of those changes too, you can make your quick access control area look different in really cool ways, but you still get bland white box standard Samsung notifications... And this bugs me because it's immediately no longer consistent and it looks awful

I just wish Samsung would give us a few more options on what our drop down notification centre looks like, including the notifications themselves... For example, simple options like changing notifications to floating rounded rectangles like stock Android P has, options to choose some base colours, maybe options to slightly alter transparency, and have all of these changes affect the whole look so it's consistently applied and you're not receiving white notifications on a black drop down notification centre

9eey88,"  

**8/10**  Pre-ordered my 512 Note 9, lavender purple, unlocked, purchased from Samsung.com, right after being notified that I could. Chose the ATK headphones for promotional item, and purchased a single fast-charging wireless charger.

**8/11-8/21** Watched many YouTube videos and scanned numerous Reddit threads and various other online feeds about the Note 9 in anticipation of receiving mine. Don’t pretend like some of you didn’t do the very same thing. 

8/22  Received my beautiful 512 Note 9, lavender purple, unlocked, purchased from Samsung.com. Excited, of course.  Already bought two phone cases and the Whitestone Dome screen protector.  That's how excited.  Opened the box, turned on the phone…..the screen had a faint line on the left side running from top to bottom of the phone. My excitement dimmed. Went online to see if anyone else had the issue and/how to fix it, and sure enough someone else said they experienced the same thing and after restarting their phone, the line went away. So, I did the same thing and sure enough, the line went away. Assuming the issue was fixed, I installed my Whitestone screen protector and used Smart Switch to transfer data/info from old phone (that I used for my trade-in). Boxed up my trade-in phone and sent it back using the return label/box.

**8/23**  Read more online comments about Note 9 screen bleeds and other issues people were having right out of the box, so I called Samsung.com customer service right away in the morning (8:25am), and talked to four different people (Luis, Sasha, Ronna, and Melissa) in just over two hours; I was bounced from one department to another (I was even sent to the warranty department and issued a ticket at one point) and eventually transferred back to customer service. I explained to each of them that I wanted to exchange my phone because it was defective right out of the box and I didn't want to take any chances since I spent so much. What I was told (and Samsung records all their calls, so if anyone has access to those, I urge you to listen to them, because their customer service personnel are awful and knowledgeable) that Samsung “doesn’t do” exchanges, they only issue returns. And I would need to return all my items from the order, including the free promotional ATK headphones and the fast wireless charger I purchased. Once I returned it, I could create another order through the website (Samsung.com), and when I received THAT new phone, I would need to call and request a code to order promotional headphones, or whatever promotional item they had available. 

I explained to Samsung.com customer service that I was unable to send them the phone back because I just sent them my back-up phone for the trade-in, so I would be without a phone until they sent me one; and since the phone I ordered was on backorder, it wouldn’t be until October until they could send me one. Talking to Melissa (10:42am of this call), she suggested that I call FedEx to have them stop the return of my back-up phone, and when I got that one back, go ahead and proceed with my Note 9 return. Frustrated of course, I said I’ll give that a try, and she issued return labels for me to send back my defective Note 9, which are good until 9/7, so that should be enough time to get my phone back and transfer the data/info again and send my new Note 9 back.

**8/24 - 8/27** Fedex wasn’t accommodating….at all. Called Samsung.com customer service (8/27 2:12pm) and talked to Diana. After explaining my situation, I’m noticing that these agents are focusing on how I don’t want to send back my promotional item (which I said I didn’t want to because I got it for pre-ordering), and their tone is accusational (not a real word, but I mean it felt like they were accusing me of pre-ordering JUST to get the promotional item and then just keep it or something), but I do my best to explain that ““I’m the customer and I received a product that was defective right out of the box, and I thought just restarting it would fix it, and it seemed to, so I put the most expensive protective screen on it, but it’s a few days later, and the line is back on the screen and even darker than before, and I’m just trying to get a non-defective phone without a bunch of hassle, and nobody seems to understand that I don’t have a back-up phone, and getting one will cost even more money, and you’re trying to make me jump through a bunch of hoops just to fix something that should’ve been as easy as, “No problem, ma’am, we’ll send you a new phone and you just send us back the defective one in the box and return label we provide you”….THAT’S how the initial conversation should’ve gone!”” How the conversation went: I was that person on the phone just rambling my frustrations to a very-new customer service employee who probably just started their shift twelve minutes earlier, and they couldn’t help me nor could they transfer me to their manager because they were on the phone with another customer. I said I’d call back the next day.

**8/28** Called Samsung.com customer service after work (4:03pm) and talked to a seemingly-helpful young lady who listened to my situation and said she understood how frustrating it must be, getting a defective phone and now not being able to send it back because I don’t have a back-up phone. She let me vent about how UN-customer-service-like it is to put all the fix-the-situation effort back onto the customer rather than have the vendor apologize for the defective phone and make it right. She said she would escalate my ticket and someone from that department would email me within 24 hours and I could converse directly with them to fix it.

**8/30** Called Samsung.com customer service (used my work phone, so I don’t have the actual time, but it was before lunch) to check on the escalated ticket, and the young man said it could take up to 72 hours for an escalated ticket to be responded to. So I wait.

**9/6** Called Samsung customer service (11:08am) Talked to a male representative and explained that the return label I have for returning my defective Note 9 expires tomorrow and I still haven’t heard from this “escalated team” from last week, and I’ve been very patient with them, and he responds by saying that he doesn’t see a request for an escalated ticket, so I correct him with the details of the date and time the ticket was requested and he said that his screen doesn’t show that, so I asked to talk to his supervisor. He placed me on hold a bunch of times, each time letting me know that his supervisor is on the phone with another customer. He finally answers and tells me that his supervisor is still on the phone, but he’ll have them call me back within an hour. Before hanging up, I confirmed that he had my correct phone number. Over three hours later, I hadn’t received any calls, so I call “customer service” again (2:28pm). First I spoke to a female representative and explained my urgent situation with the expiring return labels, but she was unable to help me, so I asked to speak with her supervisor and was put on hold several times. She got back on the phone with me every 5 minutes to let me know that she was still there, and I told her that I appreciated her checking back with me. Her supervisor,  “Melissa out of the Toronto Canada call center”, finally was on the phone and I again explained the urgency of the situation, and she said she would request an extension to have someone issue new return labels. Since she was a “supervisor” I asked her a bunch of questions about my situation and why I just wasn’t able to get my defective phone replaced, and her rote response was that it wasn’t Samsung’s policy. I wish I would’ve recorded at least this last call because it just floored me with her demeanor. I felt like she didn’t understand why I was so frustrated. I mean, I summarized my experience for her and she didn’t seem to understand what my issue was with just sending back my whole order; she kept responding with, “Samsung doesn’t have an exchange process, they only have a return process.” If I wanted to keep my pre-order promotional item, I would need to use the warranty, which is a different company.  I asked her to confirm that the request was made for the return-label extension and then hung up.

The next morning, I got an email from their return-label extension dept:

*Jennifer B. (Samsung E-Commerce)*

*Sep 7, 10:05 EDT*

*Good Morning XXXXXXX,*   
*I am contacting you regarding your Samsung.com order, xxxxxxx. I understand that you are requesting a return label for the defective Note 9 that you had received. Unfortunately, we are unable to issue a new return label at this time being that one had already been sent to you. I have resent this return label to your email address,* [*xx725@gmail.com*](mailto:jxx725@gmail.com) *and the deadline to have this product sent out is today, September 7, 2018 to prevent rejection by the warehouse.*

**9/9**  So, that’s Samsung.com’s customer service. A combination of “Sorry, not sorry” and “Figure it out for yourself” and “We don’t really know what we’re doing” and “You’re not a customer, you’re just a ticket number with these fragmented notes on my screen that 14 different reps have input over the course of two weeks”.. 

As a long-time Samsung.com customer (S6, S7, S7 Edge, Note 8, S9+), I guess I can be glad that this is the first and last time I’ll ever have to deal with Samsung.com customer service. All my other phones arrived without defect and the trade-ins went without issue. But this experience has left me with a different perspective of the whole Samsung company and I won’t be buying any more of their products until the frustration wears off. Which really stinks because I had plans to do some serious Christmas gifts this year. 

Needless to say, I’m going to have to invest in a temporary phone to use and contact the warranty people. Yep, I’m going to use the one-time warranty on a phone that came out of the box defective. Perhaps I’ll get lucky and never need the warranty for anything else. In other news, I found some YouTube videos that demonstrate being reeeeeeally careful to remove the Whitestone screen protector in order to re-apply it…so I might not have to buy another one of those. Here’s to maybe having a silver lining in all of this.

9egrbd,"So I broke my Samsung S8 display a while back and today I finally swallowed up the fact that im going to go and spend half the money i spent on the phone for a new display, and i decided to get to a Samsung Support Centre to get it fixed. I went there, waited for an hour and finally got called up to talk to the staff.

I explained my problem and he said it needed a new display, which I knew, so I agreed on the fee of £220 and he started taking information about the phone (serial numbers, model number)

A couple of minutes later he came back to me and said that my phone was sold in the United Arab Emirates (I'm from the UK) and that the parts and layout of the phone was different to those of the European Model and they didn't have the parts in stock

This was kind of a bummer but what can you do?, he'll order in some parts and I'll come back in a week or two to get it repaired then right? Wrong. He told me that he was unable to get the parts I required and my only option was to either contact  Samsung international and hope they do something or go to UAE myself.

This is absolutely ridiculous, the fact that I spent a  lot of money on this phone, and the fact that I'm willing to spend half of what I payed for the phone for a display is already insane enough, but now they can't even ship over a display for my phone?

It doesn't matter where the hell my phone originated from, Samsung is Samsung and it should care about it's customers enough to send me parts for my phone if I require them. It's like going to repair your car. It doesn't matter where the car is from, if the customer needs a part that the mechanic doesn't have, they will order it into their repair centre in order to fix the car. I don't see why Samsung is an exception.

I've chosen to spend my money (and a lot of it) on Samsung, not Apple, not Google, they should be there to fulfil my concerns and needs, especially when I'm throwing £220 in their face. Now I'm left with a cracked display that doesn't display a quarter of the screen when I play videos and has green and black bars all over it. Nice.

9eiyw8,"Hello friends. I own a Samsung s7 edge and while I have turned off not to fixations for Samsung account the thing still kepps showing up every few minutes. I swipe it away and it's back wberytime I open the phone. And to top it off, I can't get support without a Samsung account.

Now, I have very strong feelings about privacy and the right not to be pushed around by corporations in order to sell our information and souls to them. So, does anyone have a suhhestion on how to turn off this unwanted constant crsp?

I honestly feel like devoting a lot of my time and energy to get my friends and family to stop using Samsung over this. My option right now is to brick this piece of crap (for cathartic reasons) and buy a phone from a company that views me as a customer and not the product. Every time I open my phone there is a glaring reminder that Samsung doesn't want me to control my own phone and information and that they consciously and maliciously prevent people from controlling their own device.

Samsung will probably be releasing the S10 by the beginning of 2019, which means the price of the S9 will probably drop. Are there any signinficant diferences between the S8 and S9? Also, is the positioning of the fingerprint reader on the S8 that bad?

I went ahead and preordered the Note 9 from Samsung because I was able to get a small student discount, and a $400 trade in discount, and the preorder headphones gift.

The problem is I have an upcoming trip to Europe, and I fly out on September 23rd.  
  
If it arrives on the 29th, or after, I would lose my trade in discount, and I would be stuck in Europe without a reliable phone. I'm traveling alone, and it's my first time in Europe.

9ere0h,"I've had a fair few issues using my Galaxy Watch while running and was looking for some advice:

1 - While running, I can't seem to be able to use the watch at all. It's hard to explain but I can't interact with it hardly at all without it going into some kinda sleep mode or the screen dimming out again. I've left the always on display at ""on"". Is there a way of having the watch fully awake while running so I don't have to raise the phone right up to my face to see what's happening on screen?

2 - Is Spotify meant to be garbage? I've had numerous issues. It won't let me download playlists unless I'm on WiFi which makes sense, but it won't connect to my WiFi unless I manually turn Bluetooth off. Is this normal? 

3 - When I do have music playing via Bluetooth headphones and I use the usual skip track function on the headphones themselves it sometimes skips to my next song but most of the time it skips it to some default Samsung type tone which is obviously preinstalled on the watch. So annoying! Is this an issue with the watch or headphones? I've been able to use the same function on the same headphones on my phone with zero issues. 

4 - Spotify is a huge battery drain. Luckily the watch warns me about this after a run etc. How can I manually close Spotify without being prompted?

5 - If I get sent a picture on WhatsApp it sometimes shows the actual picture on my phone screen but sometimes doesn't at all. Why would this be?

A little bit of backstory. When I first got the phone, I instantly switched the resolution to 1440P and installed all my apps I needed. My worst screen on time from 100% to 1-2% was 2 hours and 40 minutes. I was getting a galaxy S6 vibe from back in the day when my old S6 was lasting really badly.

I was on **ARCA** firmware and stuff was going down the drain real fast. 1000 elements in camera folder, 29 apps. I was constantly getting 3 hours and a half of SoT, in the better days 4. I then moved to BRG6 firmware and things started looking up. I hit 5 hours SoT once and with my usual usage I got about 20-30 minutes more compared to ARCA. One redditor told me to move to BRGA and oh boy.

**BRGA** changed my *whole* S9+ experience from a buyers remorse to a loving relationship between one guy and his phone. With even more photos and 30+ apps I was getting on average half an hour of SoT more compared to BRG6. Even more, the performance of the device went UP. It felt even more fluid.

After a full reset, disabling the samsung infinity display, sitting on 1080p, disabling the antivirus, keeping half the apps... I'm constantly getting between 5 hours and 6 hours of SoT and the phone is breezy, literally breezy.

**TL;DR**: Ever since I got the phone(exynos variant), I fucking hated it's battery life and the fact that it was hanging, completely randomly freezing and so forth. It's last ""BRGA"" update made the whole phone experience worthwhile, getting constantly between 5 and 6 hours SoT and the performance of the device went up a whole level.",samsung,2018-09-11 22:43:00

I have an iconx 2018 edition earbuds and that is the reason why I have the bluetooth always ON.

I also use Google/Samsung pay all the time and that's why i have the NFC ON all the time.

Many apps (google maps, weather app, some widgets....)  need an access to the GPS and that's why i have GPS ON all the time.

I'm afraid of losing some data on my phone and that's why i have the data sync ON all the time.

Mobile data also always ON as its my main access to the internet so i have to keep it on all the time.

Finally I'm using Samsung Galaxy Note 8 at the moment and the main reason why i bought it is the gorgeous super amoled display, so the display is on QHD and i love the always on display so ... yes it is also ON all the time.


All these features are highly needed for every day use (at least for me), its 2018 after all, so i keep all things i need ON all the time !!!!

I play some games as clash of clans, clash royal, flow free ..... (not heavy games).

As expected my battery life can't always keep up till the end of the day ( but sometimes it actually does).

What i mean is: all we are living in an amazing time when the computers became so small that they actually fit in our pockets, they became so powerful that they often can replace our laptops and PCs, so i don't care about the battery life i care only about getting the maximum benefit out of it.

As you know there is really good and small power banks these days, wireless charging and fast charging technology that can help me and my phone to get through the day.

Thinking all the time only about the battery is really so sad.

Just think about it: we all buy NOT cheap super smartphones, we all look to their specs before buying them, we all need the highest end specs and technology, we all want the best phone with the maximum number of features in it ....... and sadly after buying it we:

1. Turn on power saving mode, that means: less CPU power, less GPU power, slower performance, less brightness, it also limits background processes which may affect  the whole performance of some apps and may cuz a delay in receiving some notifications from some apps and may also cuz a sync delay in some apps like ""Gmail ......... etc.), finally the power saving mode on my note 8 also recommends to turn off always on display ........

2. Turn off bluetooth: why the heck i need a truly wirless earbuds if i have to turn on and off bluetooth every time i want to use them !_!

2. Turn off GPS

3. Turn off NFC

4. Turn off sync !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

5. Finally we sometimes turn of wifi when its not needed.

Why the heck we are paying a 600-1000$ for a smartphone if we knowingly limiting its performance to a budget phone level??

 Just to save some battery juice !!!!

So I've been a Samsung user for the past few years starting with the S4 and then the S6. 

And I recently got my S9+ (256 GB) last Wednesday after ordering it 2 weeks ago from Samsung. I decided to upgrade because of the $100 discount offer on all unlocked phones ordered through Samsung or Amazon. 

Anyways getting straight to the point, this is my first device with the always on display feature. 

And I've noticed that the AOD doesn't move just like on the S7 or S8. Where it shifts every minute to avoid screen burn in. 

So can anyone tell me what's going on? And how to fix it? I'm on Android Oreo if you're wondering. 

Also I'm worried about a screen burn in, because I just got this phone and it cost me a lot of money. So I'm trying to keep like brand new. Thanks in advance ",samsung,2018-09-13 01:36:16

I obviously searched online, however it was the same thing over and over ""hold the power button and the volume up/down button"" the phone is completely unresponsive to this sort of method both when charging and not.

When not charging the phone is completely blank and unresponsive, only when it is charging does it get stuck in the loop, it doesn't even show the charging screen, just goes straight into the loop.

That being said, is this likely a problem with hardware? I saw something about a persons motherboard needing replacement but that wasn't completely the same situation. or could it be an issue in the battery, maybe something is stopping the electricity from flowing as it should?

Sliding down hides app menu.

9gnf9z,"Hey Guys!

I am currently in the process of trying to buy a Samsung Note 9 from the online store.  They are running an amazing promotion to get a Fast Wireless Charger and S3 Frontier Watch for an extra $99...amazing, right?!

Except, I've been trying to buy it on their online store since Saturday evening, and am completely unable to do so thus far.  

Background:  I am moving across the country soon, and I want to trade my Pixel 2 XL in for a Samsung phone as it is far more reliable.  I have both this Pixel and an iPhone 8 which is my work phone.  When I need a reliable phone, I always reach for my iPhone.  I want to stay in the android world, as I have made many app purchases on google play that I don't want to buy twice at the apple store.  

When I first tried to buy the Note9 with the promotion on their site, it wouldn't add the watch to my order.  Chat supports only answer was ""clear your web cache.""  I had already tried 2 different computers, several web browsers, and even the Samsung shop app on my phone. 

The second issue, after they resolved the first, is that they were unable to get the 24mo financing option to work upon checkout for the Note9 specifically. 

After all this, I decided to say fuck it, and ordered the phone in cash with my debit card.  After ordering, it showed that the phone was backordered.  Since I am on a time crunch,  I could not afford to wait for the backorder.  I called support and they told me that it was yet again another issue with the online store and that it was not actually backordered.  They told me that I would have to cancel my order and submit a new one.  Only one problem,  I don't have another fucking 1000+ dollars to spend right this moment until the original order hold on my account is lifted.  

All in all, this has been a terrible experience.  As of right now, 24mo financing is still not working.  They told me to go to a local Best Buy and speak with a Samsung rep to sort the issue out for me,  but the two best buy samsung reps told me I was SOL basically. 

Also, Samsung support has no ability to order a phone online for you on your behalf, so I have to deal with the online store that doesn't even work!

It might not be a huge issue for those that do not use the Tab S4 to play games, but it is sucking the enjoyment out of almost every game I've played so far. I've looked around on the Internet, and found several users with the same problems too. On XDA, 5ch, and Twitter (mostly Japanese).

I'm hoping it's just a software issue (errorneous touch prevention or filtering) that can be fixed, and hopefully not a hardware limitation.


Example: Frequently when I tap or hold 2 points on the screen, the tablet ignores those inputs. Swiping/flicking across the screen also results in spotty input detection, and using moving 2 fingers on the screen results in huge input delay.


I've contacted Samsung Customer Service, and they provided the standard procedures, of which nothing helped. DMed by country's Samsung twitter and was ignored. Posted and error log on Samsung Members and was ignored too. I'm currently at a loss here, I don't know if I should keep the tablet and keep hoping Samsung releases a fix for it.

I'm not going to say the phone sucks or the battery was bad, but it was objectively worse than my previous phone and that didn't work for me when considering how little time I have access to a charger. Because of this, I contacted support with this reasoning and a successful return was initiated.





Jump forward to me sending the S9 back. I had packed all necessary cables (the charger block, the charger cable, and the headphones), the phone itself in its still pristine condition, and even all documentation (including the little SIM tray key). I send it back in the box and I get an email that Samsung received it on April 26th. Okay, weird that it took so long to get it received and processed, but whatever. 






Well, literally one day outside of the return window closing, they send me an email saying that my return was unsuccessful and that the phone was being shipped back. I was extremely confused because my return was shipped with receipt within the return window and was in factory condition with ALL included accessories inside the original box. Not according to them. This was the reasoning: ""Either product has physical damage (or) return received outside of returns window (or) return is missing parts (or) return not in OEM box.""





I was confused and thought that I maybe messed up and waited for the phone in the mail. I get the phone, take it out and EVERYTHING IS THERE. I didn't understand why it was rejected. All parts were there, the phone was without a scratch and worked just fine (tested to be sure). Nothing was wrong. I get angry because someone didn't do their due diligence and I contact support in a respectful manner. I tell them this and they give the go-ahead on a 30-day extension of the return window and ask me to send it back in. So, I do. Fast forward to the close of that return window, I get the SAME email. Same response. Same reasoning: ""Either product has physical damage (or) return received outside of returns window (or) return is missing parts (or) return not in OEM box.""







I was pissed, but I thought ""okay fine, I'll just sell the phone and use it to pay back the credit line for the phone."" I waited for the phone. I waited and waited. It never came back. Okay, maybe it'll take a bit to get back. Maybe something happened.






So, I wait. I wait some more. I finally contact customer support over the website IM chat and ask if they still have my phone and they do. I ask to please look into the phone box and validate what is in the box and the state of the phone because it will be immediately resolve if someone just looked in the box. I ask this again and again a few times a week. The same answer is given that they are looking into it and ""nothing from the warehouse was posted yet."" Okay, fine. I ease off a bit and wait. Still nothing. 






At this point, I go for plan B: just give me back the phone. It was clear they didn't want to refund me so I asked for the phone back on June 26th in an email with support. I told them in no uncertain terms: ""Please ship the phone in its included box and accessories back to me. Thank you.""






Since then, there has been no effort made to get the phone back. I have literally called almost every other day at some points and every week at other points. I have even stopped for a couple weeks to see if anything would start moving. Nothing. I call every week and get the same answer ""it's lost in the warehouse, it needs to be validated."" I ask why they didn't ship back to me and they say ""well it was marked to ship back to you, did you not receive it?"" I say no. They look into it further and receive NO SHIPPING # WAS EVER POSTED, meaning no shipment to me was ever made. I also know this because I have it set up with the shipping services to notify me when something is being shipped to my address. I never got that notification.





So I have two different things proving that nothing was ever shipped. They claim that it's lost in the warehouse. No matter how much I call and ask, no matter how respectful or confrontational I am, and no matter how much time has passed, it is ALWAYS ""lost in the warehouse."" It has been this way for months and it is now September 18.






So, in short, I am paying for a phone that I have not had since MAY (4 months) because Samsung lost it. They refuse a refund still. They refuse to send me a new phone. I have been effectively screwed out of the full price of a Galaxy S9. 





You can bet that I will no longer recommend Samsung and will no longer buy any more products or services from them. But anyways, does anyone know what else I can do? I've bothered them via chat, email, and phone for 4 months now and nothing has been done. I can't do charge-backs because it's from a credit line through their service.

I pulled my phone out and I have a pea sized shatter right below the middle and a little bit to the left of the curve of the display.

I accept that I most likely rubbed the phone against the side of the chair which has a bit of metal and stuff. I'm wondering what my options are. Does Samsung/AT&amp;T offer screen repairs for the Note 9 yet? Would a third party store like iFixIt be able to repair my phone?

I've tried breaking free before with an S6, an S9, and an LG G4. But every time, I end up back on iOS because of a couple of reasons:

1. iMessage is baller, especially with my kids. Sharing pics and videos is the best. And being able to message from my work computer without having to pick up my phone.
2. The Find My Friends feature is a security necessity with my kids. I know where they are at all times, which is a bit draconic on my part, but is something that, living in the Atlanta Metro area, I believe is key.

The Google Pixelbook is tempting but the price tag is a no go seeing as the Chromebook Pro and Plus are half of that and appear to do everything the Pixelbook does. ",samsung,2018-09-20 13:08:12

So I recently got a new phone, I took the Galaxy A8 because it sounded like a great phone for the price, and I love it right now.

The only problem is the battery. I find that it is losing battery extremely fast for a new phone. About 15-20% for an hour of using the phone only to configure stuff and install apps, and then about 15% lost over 6 hours of not using it.

Is that a normal rate for new phones? Am I already required to desactivate cool features such as the time showing up when idle and activate power saving mode just to get a decent time of usage?

I purchased my note 8 roughly 3 months ago and have really been enjoying the phone, which is why I was very disappointed today when, out of the blue, my phone screen went blank and never came back on.

I can feel the haptic feedback of the keys, can hear the noises the phone makes, etc... Also when plugged in to the Samsung dex station I can mirror my phone onto my desktop as well as run the dex desktop. 

I have tried hard resets and factory resets to no avail. 3 months into a lease with a broken phone that I believe had no real part in causing is a bit of an issue for me.

I got a new Samsung 32 inch Smart TV, still under warranty and probably due to the thinness of the design (I never encountered this issue with other TVs but they are old and thick) I accidentally put some finger pressure on the screen and it created a small black spot. The SCREEN itself appears to work perfectly fine, as there are no dead pixels or anything. It’s just the backlighting on the small area is a bit dark.

So since I’m under warranty, and the sheet (backlight diffuser?) behind the actual screen appeared to have got dirt due to contact with the panel while it was on and warm I can just call the repairman and have the thing cleaned and it will be good as new right? And in case the sheet is damaged, hopefully the service center has a spare one?

8wcnra,"I shipped a monitor to Samsung's repair facility in NJ towards the end of April, that was purchased in January, with my own money. It was a 32"" monitor and I no longer had the original shipping materials, so it was about 50 bucks for materials and shipping to them, but I digress. So after about two months I spoke to a rep and they were giving me a run-around that i needed to sign some form which would take two days to email. Ok, fine enough. Never heard from that rep again, and he ignored all further communication. Fast forward a week and still no email, I call again and and spoke to samsung (not the warranty dept) and they transfer me to a closed dept. 

Four days later I call again, this time telling me the monitor has shipped and would take 7-10 business days to arrive. Thank god! I call back on the 11th day just to get a tracking number because they said I would need to be home, and it was never emailed. Well turns out it wasn't shipped. So after 30 mins on the phone they promise that they spoke to the warehouse and that it would go out that day or the next and I would be emailed a tracking number on monday. Monday morning I email the new rep that gave me her email, and no reply, same for tuesday and wednesday. I finally hear from her today, thursday, and am told that it did not go out last week or at all and now I'm back at square one.

I have had over 10 calls to the warranty dept and samsung combined with three chats on the website ranging from late may til today. Total time spent on this is about 30 minutes per call. I'm at my wits end. I told them I don't care if if the same monitor, I just need a monitor back at this point. 

At this point I don't know what else to do. Contact the BBB and/or State Attourney General? Are there any samsung reps here that can get this fixed?",samsung,2018-07-05 18:08:33

8wdkbq,"I have been getting this error for a couple of weeks now. I've looked here and other places for possible fixes but nothing I'm trying seems to work. Let me give you a little history. 

My phone will charge just fine when plugged in to a normal wall charger. It used to charge just fine when plugged into my PC, portable charging brick or USB charging hub. When I started getting this error, it stopped working on everything but the wall charger. (sort of)

Now, I get a moisture detected error if I plug it in to anything other than the wall charger. It did not get wet. I've tried to dry it in rice, with a fan, etc. I've tried the deleting USB data and booting to safe mode fixes and they do not work. 

Now SOMETIMES, if I poke around the charging port lightly with a thin piece of plastic, it will charge on my USB charging hub or portable charging brick. It will still not work on my PC. But the weird thing is... if I manage to get it to work on one of those 2 things, the next time I plug it in to my regular wall charger, I get the moisture error. Then I have to unplug it and plug it right back in for it to start charging, which it does. And the other chargers will start giving me that error again. 

I don't think there is actually a moisture issue as the wall charger works perfectly. The 2 usb chargers that actually work sometimes require some poking around but they will always give me that error at first. 

None of the fixes I've seen online are working and I'm getting really frustrated. I don't mind plugging it in to the wall for now, but I like to know I can charge my phone on the go if I need to. The only other thing I can think of is around the same time I started getting this error, I also started getting another error when I plug it in to these same chargers. Something about Samsung Gear VR not being able to connect. I have never used Samsung Gear VR and never attempted to. It just gives me that error maybe once out of 10 times I plug it in to a USB charger (not the wall charger). Of course that's a SAMSUNG app so I can't uninstall it. I've tried to disable it but it doesn't stop the moisture error.

8wpszk,"Hi guys,

Tonight I checked my email to be quite disappointed. For a little background info, I decided to buy an S9 from Samsung.com and I sent them my old iPhone 6 to save $75. I brought the iPhone to a Fed Ex ship center and packaged it in a small, bubble-wrapped envelope. The last time I laid my eyes on it, the phone was in pretty decent condition. The screen had absolutely no cracks and the body was in a fair and acceptable condition. I naively did not take any pictures because I saw this situation as unlikely, and had to much faith in the system.

When I received the pictures from Samsung, the screen had a huge crack near the top of it. Now, my $75 iPhone is worth $25. Is it possible it was damaged in shipping? If so, is there anything I can do about it? Would I be able to receive any compensation from Fed Ex? On the other hand, is there any sort of way I can make an appeal with Samsung?

I'm unfortunately feeling like there's nothing I can do, but it's very frustrating being that I would have rathered just keep the phone to use as an mp3 if it would only be worth $25. I'll take any possible solutions gratefully.

- back of phone is shattered (can barely tell with the case on though)
- some pretty heavy amoled screen burn but phone is still usable
- battery life aint what it used to be.

My phone provider has a pretty cool deal going today only. I can get a new Samsung phone on a new 2 year contract for $100 off, plus I get 2 GB bonus data for free with my new plan.

I'm looking at both the S9+ , and the Note 8 and not sure which one would be better for me.. I'm an amateur musician and author, so I'm not sure which phone is better for the ""creative person"" though I like that they both have nice large screens and I like the stereo speakers on the 9+

My other option is to be rid of my contract , get a new plan for half of what I'm paying now, and keep the S7 for 2 more years and hope it lasts.   Any advice ? Is the S7 gonna last much longer ? Is the 9+ or note8 really gonna wow me a lot if I choose to upgrade? Any advice is appreciated!

I have a refurbished Samsung S7 Edge I bought maybe two months ago (I know its not current gen, but I have a budget. The volume button cave in and as a consequence the phone keeps rebooting into safe mode. I initially contacted Samsung support via chat. I carefully  explained the situation, being explicit about the condition of the phone. The representative at chat assured me repair would be covered under warranty free of charge. He filled out a ticket and sent a free UPS label. I sent the phone back. About three-four days later I received an e-mail from Samsung with an invoice for $0.00 for the repair.

About a week goes by after that and I still haven't received my phone back or any further communication from Samsung, so I initiated another chat looking for an update. The representative on chat told me the repair was on hold due to a ""payment processing issue"". I asked for more detail about this and for him to confirm whether or not they were showing I owed them anything and if I did owe anything, how much. They told me they did not have access to this information and to call 800-SAMSUNG.

I called 800-SAMSUNG and spoke with a representative who told me the same thing, the repair was on hold due to a ""payment processing issue"". I asked this representative the same thing, if confirm whether or not they showed I owed anything and if so how much. I was told them don't have access to this information either. I was told I'd need to speak a different facility for this information, however being a Saturday afternoon, they were closed for the weekend. I asked for a direct number to this facility so I could call on Monday. I was told they do not have a direct phone number. I was instructed to call back to 800-SAMSUNG on Monday.

I called 800-SAMSUNG on Monday. Was told the same thing as before, they did not access to see whether or not I owed them anything (which is absolutely bizarre). I was told again I'd need to speak with this other facility. This time I was provided a direct phone number to reach them, 877-467-3322. I called this number and it took me 10+ minutes on hold to get through to somebody. The first time, when the line connected to a live person, all I got was ""Hello?"" then the line disconnected. I immediately called back and after another 10+ minutes of holding, and got a rep. I asked them the same question, do they or do they not show that I owe them anything for this repair, and if so how much? I was told by this representative that they did not have access to this information either. She told me she could e-mail another department for an answer, but it'd be two-three business days for a response. At this point I was understandably livid and asked for a supervisor. I was told by this rep  ""we don't have supervisors here"". This is an exact quote and not an exaggeration or paraphrase. I called her out on this. You most certainly do have a supervisor. The rep continued to deny she has a supervisor then transferred me back to 800-SAMSUNG while I was mid-sentence.

I explained the briefly explained to the 800-SAMSUNG rep and then asked to speak a supervisor. She told me sure then put me on an extended mute. She came back and told me the cost of my repair was $70 and change, but she'd happy to discount it for me. I told this was a nice gesture, but I don't feel I should owe them anything, and asked for supervisor a second time. The rep then disconnected without saying anything.

About five minutes later a supervisor called me back. She told me that my phone was out of warranty because of its condition. The reasons she cited for this were a. damage to the screen and b. damage to the volume down button. I told her there was no damage to the screen whatsoever prior to me sending this back to them. If they are saying there is damage to the screen, this is objectively false. I also explained her stating its out of warranty due to the volume button being damaged is bizarre as I had made the first rep I chatted with explicitly aware of this, This was, in fact, the very reason I sent it for them for repair in the first place! I also reviewed the fact I was assured there'd be no cost to me and that I had previously received a $0.00 invoice. The supervisor then told me, right, normally this would've cost me $70 and change, however it looks like someone had previously already discounted the ticket for the full repair cost. She gave me a date for when it was first discounted. The date she gave me matched the date I received the $0.00 invoice. I asked, if there were the case, why the very first rep I spoke with either on chat or the phone, or any the subsequent reps I spoke with, were unable to provide me with this info? Why did I have to go through seven levels of customer service hell to find out I was owe them nothing? The supervisor did not have an answer for this. Just said she couldn't speak to what other reps would have told me. I asked her if the repair was on hold. She told me it was not, that it was still in progress. I asked her if she could give me an estimated time-frame for when I'd get my phone back. She just gave me general information: repairs usually take 5-7 business days that I'd get an e-mail when I shipped out. I found this answer to be a bit wishy-washy, especially since it had already been 5-7 business days since I sent it back, but I let it go because I had already spent close to two hours on the phone at this point. I guess I'll just wait and see if I ever get my phone back. Honestly, if I had my way at this point, I'd ask them just to keep the thing and provide me a full refund so I can go buy a phone through someone else, but I know they'd never go for that.

Anyone else have any experience escalating issues with Samsung customer service? Any suggestions? I was thinking about possibly taking to Twitter? Anyone know of any better channels? ",samsung,2018-07-09 18:25:31

8xk9an,"I have a Samsung Galaxy S5, running haggertk's unofficial Lineage OS 15.1 ROM. I've had this issue a month ago, and three days ago. The first time this issue appeared, the phone won't charge at all. So I removed the battery for a couple of hours and tried to charge it, and voilà! It started to charge again. Second time, a few days ago, it happened again. So I removed the battery overnight and tried to reinsert it the morning after that. No issues. The phone charged. Now, it happened again (that was on a span of 4 days after the second time it happened).

I'm pretty certain it is not my cable's fault since I've tried all of the available cables and chargers. I've also hooked it to my laptop which it recognises but throws me an error saying ""Device descriptor failed"". I've also hooked it to my power bank. The power bank lights up, meaning there
was contact, but not charging. Also, when I try to charge my phone when it is off, it proceeds to the charging icon. Then it will proceed to the battery indicator, but the battery indicator doesn't animate. Then it will restart and do the same process again.

I could charge the phone off of an external charger but I really need to know what the hell is the problem. I also remember, I ordered a port cover and tried to test its water resistance by spraying water on the phone's port area. I'm sure no water came in since the insides were dry. I also cleaned the port using 70% alcohol solution and a cotton. I've also checked if the phone's contacts were bent which I'm glad were not. So it all comes down to two culprits: the daughterboard and the battery.

8xovgw,"I've always used Samsung phones but I've always been able to find custom roms that work properly. 

I have a Note FE (after having the Note 7 taken away) and it's still my favorite. 

But... I can't use it as my daily phone. The default DPI is 411. For a phone with a screen this size it's stupid. Everything is huge. I like to have it set to 550 to make use of the screen.

But upping the DPI breaks everything made by Samsung.

Phone app: visual/animation glitches. 
Camera app: visual/animation glitches.
AOD: Crashes when opening AOD settings (fixed in latest version)
AOD: Increasing DPI (Making things smaller) makes the AOD BIGGER! Instead of smaller. 
Samsung Keyboard: Don't get me started. Just use the Google keyboard.

So yeah. I find it really frustrating because I LOVE the phone but I literally cannot use it with these issues. I know it's a first world problem but I have a OnePlus and it works much better, but I'd much prefer the Note FE if it worked.

I know I could replace the dialer, use a different camera app, disable AOD and use the Google keyboard but I like a lot of these features, especially AOD. And also, for such an expensive phone, Samsung should be developing their applications properly. There's no excuse in 2018 for their software to not be DPI aware. 

So that's my rant. Just thought I'd post and see if anyone agrees or maybe have some solutions. I'll probably end up selling the phone though. :( It would be nice if Samsung could see this and push updates to fix the issues but I know it won't happen. :(

8y02da,"Right, I've had a pretty torrid experience with Samsung the past 7 months and I want to tell you all what happened and see if any of you have been through anything similar and how you resolved the issue.

 

It all started in November, I purchased a pretty 50 inch Phillips Ambilight that had terrible banding issues to the point that 4K, HD and SD were unwatchable. I decided to return it to the retailer and bought a 55mu7000 with at first I was overjoyed with. After a few days of usage a friend came round and noticed clumps of dead pixels to the corners of the TV, I had a repairman from Samsung come out who replaced the screen which had even more dead pixels and they didn't even bother to contact me back after promising me they would.

 

Here's where a little silver lining happened. Samsung phoned me after I chased them around ten days later, offering me a 55Q8FAM which I was pleasantly surprised about. I unboxed it, set it up and could not beleive how lucky I was to get this expensive model. After a week however, I was watching the champions league when the dreaded vertical lines started appearing. Samsung proceeded to remote into my television and advised me that everything was fine with the unit, I took their word for it as I thought I may be over careful due to the issues I had before.

 

Three months later the lines got worse, forcing me to contact Samsung support again, to be told there was no issue and they couldn't just replace it as it was past the 28 day period. After a lot of back and forth with their customer relations team I managed to get them to agree to a replacement. Brilliant, I thought. Oh how I was wrong.

 

Please see the attached image to see just how bad my current unit is. Would any of you put up with the state of that and is it as bad as I feel it is? I'm currently in touch with the President however I feel I'm being brushed aside, rather than offer me a replacement as a good will gesture they are offering me a refund of the original price I paid for the MU7000. Any and all advise would be appreciated in solving this matter.

I have had the S8 for little over a year now and with this past update I have been experiencing a few problems. I was wondering if you guys have also been having these/ might know some solutions. 

1) If I have the phone plugged in and restart it, the Samsung logo will appear but that's it. The phone will black out and vibrate a little. Then couple seconds later it will vibrate again and the logo will appear just for it to keep repeating this process till I unplug the phone. Now once it's unplugged it will complete the restart. 

2) My fast charging have ""quit"" working. I say ""quit"" because if I plug the phone in it will start charging and say fast charging, but a few seconds later it will vibrate again and show the charing annotation but change from fast charging to just regular charging. Yet the estimated time till fully charged will be the same. 

For both of these I hate treid different cables and charging bricks. I have multiple Samsung bricks and I either use aukey/Anker cables or Samsung's cables. I've also wiped cache partition and the problem still persist.

3. This isn't as important, but ESPN notifications won't show up, I've tried to uninstall and reinstall and I made sure the app isnt in the always sleeping state, but they still don't show up.

8y58lw,"I bought this TV last  year, namely for the smart TV features for Netflix/Amazon/Hulu.  For the first month or so, everything was great. No issues at all.  After that, I started getting random disconnects while watching a show, but nothing too bad. 

These past several months though have been just awful.  I will start up a show on Netflix, and about 3 minutes into the episode it disconnects me from my network.   I will then attempt to re-connect to the Network, but my 5GHz no longer displays.  The solution for this is to either  

A) turn off the TV for several minutes and turn it back on  

B) Connect to my 2.4GHz, disconnect from that, then my 5GHz will re-appear.  

Once I am reconnected to the internet, I get about 3-5 minutes of show time before it cuts out again.  This happens with all streaming apps on the television.   Why not use my 2.4GHz connection you ask? Well, despite the fact that I can browse YouTube while on the 2.4GHz connection, it acts as if it's entirely disconnected from the internet otherwise. Netflix just tells me I am not connected, Prime won't load, and Hulu asks me to connect to a network. 

There is no issue with the Router/Modem or anything else.  In the house we have 2 computers, 2 cell phones, a Wii, and my series 1 Amazon Firestick.  Using Netflix through the Firestick has absolutely no problems what so ever. I can start up a show, watch 3 episodes, and by morning still be connected to Netflix.  The Firestick though cannot handle Plex, and since it's a series 1 it takes a good 15-20 minutes to even load up, so it's really not a feasible option. 

Whatever this issue is; has something to do with the television set itself.  Samsungs error tries to pin the blame on my ISP by saying ""Problem with your network connection? Contact your ISP!"" 

The whole ordeal is super frustrating, and I am hoping that someone has some sort of solution to frequent disconnects with their Samsung SmartTV.   

In terms of distance to the router, I am in the same room as the router. I am currently touching the television as I touch the router.

Except it turns out that as it's from a different market, Samsung Pay won't accept the details of a card from my country. And that's ok, too, I don't want to use it anyway... except I cant turn it off. Since it won't accept a card, it won't let me into app proper where presumably I can tell it not to bother me.  I keep getting that transparent pop up tab under the app tray on my home screen. Currently I just go into settings - apps - Samsung pay and force stop every few days when it inevitably pops up again.

8yibym,"Hey, so I was using my s8 just as normal when I noticed the screen to start flickering black lines out of nowhere, at first I thought it was just the app so I closed it and the problem seemed to go away. However after a few minutes the problem escalated and instead of black likes my phone seemed to start flickering bright green lines uncontrollably for around 5 seconds which after would leave the phones display very saturated, the weird part is, is that this wasn't permanent, at points the display would be fine 

Anyway, after many different issues, the current state of the phone is that whenever I unlock it, it does the green flickering and then either fixes itself and goes to normal or the screen goes a red-ish tint, sometimes with faint dark lines across the screen or goes to a saturated display with a green tint

This problem seems like a hardware issue but the fact that around 15% of the time it is completely normal makes me think it may be software

8yiq8i,"I'm deeply disappointed in Samsung right now. There's been a great app, Samsung Focus - must-have if you work in a corporate environment where Exchange email system is used. This is the first and only Exchange-enabling e-mail app that I found to work well. Why? Because unlike the official Outlook app, and most of the other Exchange-enabled email apps, it allowed me to:

* Sync contacts to my actual contacts (not a separate contact book)
* Sync selected calendars to my actual phone calendar (not in a separate, in-app only calendar)
* Have a nice overview of actually important stuff (Outlook can do this to some extent, but not as well as Focus)

And so many other things. It just felt more of a first-class citizen on my Samsung phone than anything other.

8yk7je,"So today I was watching Netflix and I live in an apartment the modern one with windows everywhere so people outside my apartment in the nearby apartments can see what were watching, while watching the movie at some point it started randomly fast forwarding or rewinding and we were holding the remote in our hands trying to stop it so that means no one was sitting on the remote or anything, and I told my gf that maybe someone used a remote app on their phone to do this because I had seen someone do this with their phone before and we suddenly started looking around and when we turned around someone in the apartment next to us quickly hid his head behind the curtain when he saw us look at him, I think he might be using his phone app as a remote to do things on my tv, especially since as soon as we closed the curtains it stopped, so now I know he couldn't have a same remote or something to do that because the apartments are too far apart but a phone signal might be able to cross that distance, so I think it's probably his phone.

So now I want to know first how can i know if a phone remote is connected to my tv and second how to disconnect that or completely disable that function. Or is it even possible otherwise if it's not possible what should I do to stop this from happening, 

I want contacting the other apartment and complaining to be the last resort because that might make things worse in the long run if they get offended and now start doing it all the time, also I have no evidence he actually did it that's why I want to know how to check if someone's connected to it

And also if it's just a really long range special remote he bought then I want to know how to if possible to disable remote control as a whole on my smart tv

I have a Samsung smart tv (the one that curves around) i can check the exact model if that would help but I think they are all pretty similar.

After I sold it I was researching a bit further about security, and I found out about FRP.

Now I am worried the person may not be able to use the phone without signing in to my Google account?

NOTE: I did complete the factory restore and then went through the setup process just skipping everything I could, did NOT connect to wi-fi etc. I was able to get to the home screen and was not asked to sign into Google at any point, and I confirmed that my data was gone (phone was 64gb, showed 56gb available). Then I did another factory reset so the buyer could go through the setup themselves.

Am I worried over nothing, or will this person not be able to access the phone? When is the FRP triggered, is it only when connected to wifi and/or inserting a SIM?

I haven't heard anything from the buyer, they were pretty excited about getting the phone so I guess they would have been through setup by now. I might send a message tonight to make sure they could set it up all OK?

8ytrdh,"On Wednesday July 11th, I was browsing Samsung website. I was looking at the phones and noticed a 200$ off coupon for the galaxy s9 if it was for Verizon.

Now I've been very unhappy with AT&amp;T and have been planning to switch, not to mention I'm still on my parents plan so I needed to start my own anyways. So with my current phone on the verge of death, this coupon was the last little nudge I needed to switch to Verizon.

I want through the purchasing process. I selected the Galaxy s9 for 720$. I applied the coupon to make it 520$. I could trade in my old phone for 75$ making the total down to 450$ plus Samsung was going to give me a free 64g memory chip! Great. Now issues.

Then I need to log in, which I do. Keep in mind the order isn't yet in my cart. Okay now I need to link my Verizon account. What? Read terms and condition of the promotion and it said that a Verizon account isn't required at purchase, as long as I sign up with Verizon promptly after otherwise the coupon gets removed after the fact. Okay that's fair.

So there's two buttons. Sign in to Verizon account, or I don't have an account. So I click I don't have an account. Then I need to type in the zip code I'll mainly use the phone in. Then I type in a whole bunch of personal info. All still on the sumsung website. 

Turns out that's the application for the phone. To get the 0% apt for 24 months with 0$ down I needed to do a credit app. Again, that's okay. I have great credit. I submit the app and it says Verizon needs to talk to you, please call Verizon number and give them this app number. The instructions also state once this is finished, click continue to add order to cart.

Talk to Verizon and there was a small hiccup because I had a credit freeze so I had to get that removed then call Verizon back to confirm. I do that and they say I'm approved and I'm okay to proceed.

I click the next button on the Samsung website. Nothing happens. Click again. Nothing. Wut. Okay over the next couple hours, I redo the entire process on 2 different web browsers using my phone work computer and home computer, and cleared cookies and caches in between. All of them get to the same point and shows the original application I'd. Again, wut.

I call Verizon back and they assured me I'm good. It's a glitch with Samsung. I literally spend HOURS with Samsung on the phone being transferred multiple times between their sales, e-commerce, activations, and tech support departments. Every depart says they can't do it and one of the others have to fix it. No one tries to help, no one really does anything. They basically said hi how can I help, I tell them the whole story, and they say they have to transfer me.


By now I'm fed up, I use their online chat so I can at least know who I'm talking too. Reexplain everything, first person disconnects on their own and gets a second person. Second person helps me troubleshoot to no success. He finally says only way to help is to end the chat and to respond to the confirmation email with a screenshot of where I'm stuck. Then I'd get a response to help.

I said I didn't want to do that because the coupon expired today. The rep promised this was the only way and that they would help me. So foolishly I close the chat. I get an email with a full transcript which is nice and I respond to it with the screenshot as instructed.

 It's been days and nothing. No phone. No response. Coupon now expired. I feel like this is deception and or false advertising. What can I do? I don't know if Samsung employees run this or frequent this sub, but I know on other subs there are employees that will chime on to help. I need to know how to resolve this and get the coupon that I wasn't able to get. ",samsung,2018-07-14 14:48:17

Android Oreo được cập nhật cho Galaxy S7 và Galaxy S7 với khoảng 1,7 GB. Ngoài những tính năng gốc mà Google đã đưa vào Oreo, phần mềm mới lặp lại bao gồm giao diện người mua trải nghiệm 9.0 của Samsung (mà bạn mang thể đã thấy trên họ Galaxy S9 ). Hơn nữa, bản cập nhật này còn tương trợ GSMA Universal Profile 1.0, cho phép truyền tệp lên đến 100 MB qua tin nhắn.

I'm finally giving in and admitting I need to upgrade my phone. I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini right now (which was discontinued when I got it), and I've replaced the battery and added a micro-SD card, but it's just too slow to keep up anymore, and freezes constantly when I use google maps or check transit apps for the bus, let alone things like messenger and texting. Streaming video and music still works, but it heats my phone up like crazy, to the point I take it out of it's otterbox because it will refuse to charge from the heat and makes my fingers hurt when I touch it. (And I'm a barista. I know hot finger pain.)

SO, I'm going to upgrade, but I'm stuck between the Pixel 2 and the Samsung S9, based on what I've read/heard about them. (I know neither of them will fit in my pocket, which is the real bummer here.) I don't know much about electronics, and I'm really looking for the idiot-proof version of help to decide here. They're close enough in price through Verizon that it's not a huge factor here for me. I know that the real drawback for google is it doesn't have a headphone jack and screen burn, while the S9 is the battery and updates.

I really just want a phone I can play stupid games on, that might stay in my back pocket when I crouch, with a nice camera that I can take 600-1200 DPI photos of my illustrations with, and will play spotify while I sleep without me having to worry about setting my sheets on fire.

I'm open to other models as suggestions, but I don't want an iPhone at all, and Verizon needs to carry it. (They're literally the only one with reception at my parents house, which I still spend time at regularly, and it's barely even there.)

When trying to select display mode Film/Movie all screen goes black, freezes and starts to show lines of various colors across the screen.

I opened a chat at Samsungs website, described the problem, showed a photo. But to no help, I only got a referral to a phone number for a local engineer to visit me and look at the issue, at an extra cost of course.   


I then found a simple Youtube-clip, that explained how to reset the Smart TV device with the remote, by pressing Info - menu - Mute and then Power on. Through the factory menu I managed to reset my device back to factory settings. Software version is however still the faulty one.  


When the device was new, I could use the 3D mode fine, but the resent versions have destroyed my smart tv device completely rendering it useless for the purpose I bought it, to watch 3D movies.   


How do I revert back to a working firmware / software? (The device seem to update itself, so I have no control over it)   


On a sidenote, it has also begun ""ghosting"" lately, where it turns itself on after being in stand by mode for about 15-30 minutes. it does not start fully all the time, sometimes it is only the display that turns on, without loading in channels or software.

In a moment of panic they gave me the choice and as a reservation i calculated and went with the normal pattern on avoid the plane Jane color and going for the fun one.

I didn't realise until i set up the phone and watched a few more videos on the S8. I FUCKED UP lol.

Will i ever get over this? 

Maybe there's a light in the tunnel. Certainly every person who bought a Galaxy S8+ most got the black. So i could be the rarity. Of all the other colors i kinda like Orchid Grey i guess because it kinda has this changing personality.... I dunno purple is good too.

90dqzb,"Hello, as seen in the title, my regular S8 suddenly green screened and now the screen will not respond. Shortly(i.e about and hour or so before hand) before the green screen itself, there appeared to be an odd flickering of the screen that would go away when i put the phone to sleep and woke it back up. After the green screen, the phone blacked out and will not respond to anything, though holding down the power button does get a small vibrate, and I'm scared to go into recovery mode as if the screen doesn't work then, i might absolutely wreck the phone without knowing it.

I also think it might help to mention that i had given the screen a mildy bad crack on the corner of the screen today outside, and some water may have gotten on/in the crack itself.

Anyone with a S9 how is it in comparison to the S8? Or should I save a bit of money and get the bigger screen of the S8+? Price range they're about similar so I've been tossing between the two of them.

I'm renting a new home with an outlet hardwired where I'd like to install the television above the fireplace. There is also a porthole (for lack of a better term) where an HDMI cable comes through and is fed through to the right and at the bottom of the adjoining wall (where I'd plug it into a cable box). However, it seems like the HDMI cord is anchored in place against the frame so I can't feed more HDMI cords through (or remove the existing cord) and I'd like to also connect a PS4 Pro and Nintendo to my television.
An HDMI hub at the bottom of the wall where the HDMI pokes through to connect to a cable box etc. seems to be the logical solution. The issue here is that the TV I have is a Samsung MU model that has an HDMI itself and connects to the TV through a Samsung ""One Connect"" cable. The TV itself has no place to plug in an HDMI cord, it's all through the One Connect hub.
If I use an HDMI hub, will I still be able to switch inputs to the PS4, Nintendo etc. using the TV. Or will the TV read me pressing input as switching the inputs on the One Connect hub (and therefore switch to an input with nothing plugged into it since, as I mentioned, it seems like I'm only limited to one HDMI cord thanks to the stupidity of whoever built this house).",samsung,2018-07-21 02:01:03

90rnig,"I'm posting this just in case anyone has a similar issue and seeks a remedy to it.

I bought my Note 8 using the Shop Samsung app back in January 2018. They had a much better deal than T-Mobile did at the time including a great trade-in offer ($350 for my S7 Edge, a discounted price, and free AKG Bluetooth headphones.) 

I got the phone and sent in my S7 Edge as a trade-in either in late January or early February.  The basics of the trade-in was a ""functional screen"" and ""normal wear and tear.""  The screen part of the contract specifically states that the screen is to have no cracks (which my phone did not). 

Fast forward four months to June 2018 and I get an email stating that my S7 Edge did not meet minimum requirements for the trade-in offer and that Samsung would be charging back $325 of the $350 trade-in value of my phone. 

I emailed the CSR and tried to find out the specifics of the issues they had with the phone. After repeated emails back and forth, they had two issues with the phone. The first was apparently burn-in on the screen. I can say the phone did have a slight amount of burn-in at the top where the notification bar is located, but that it  was very difficult to see the burn-in unless you were really looking for it. The second issue they had was ""damage to the chassis"" which I knew immediately what they were talking about. My phone had a very, very small nick on the left aluminum side rail.

To me, both of those issues were part of normal wear and tear since no one's phone is perfect and burn-in and amoled displays go together like peas and carrots.

I ended up contacting and submitting a claim through the Better Business Bureau on New Jersey where Samsung's US headquarters is located. It took about three weeks, but I recently got an email from Samsung through the BBB, that they were cancelling the $325 chargeback as a ""one-time adjustment."" 

Next time, I will be taking photos of the entire phone before sending it in, if I trust Samsung at all next time with a trade-in.

Basically, my samsung note 5 stopped charging because something was wrong with the port on it. I decided that even tho I had this problem, I'd still stick with Samsung. I got the Samsung galaxy s8 plus and under a year later the phone starts having problems with charging. It wont charge and when I attempt to charge it, it smells like smoke and like something is on fire. The charger becomes hot to the touch as well. 

I'm using the charger that came with the phone. I also tried a new charger incase it was the charger, did the same thing. I go to at&amp;t and they basically tell me I'd have to go to samsung to get them to either fix or replace the phone. Even though I have insurance on the phone. I ask them if they would provide a loaner phone while mine is being repaired they say no. I ask if I can trade the phone in they say not until more than half the phone is paid off because I'm on a payment plan for it. 

I contact samsung they tell me that I have to send in the phone but delete everything off the phone first and back it up. How am I supposed to do that when the port doesn't work? I say ok, but do I get a replacement phone first? They say at&amp;t will give me a loaner phone. I tell them at&amp;t said they dont do that. He says I'd have to contact at&amp;t still to get a loaner phone. I ask if the phone is covered under warranty, they say it's under a year so as long as the phone doesn't have water damage then I probably wont pay anything. 


At this point I'm fed up with Samsung and at&amp;t and I just want to return the phone and get the money I've paid for the phone back to use for a different phone. Is there anyone who knows what my options are at this point? Or anyone who had something similar happen?

So I recently got a new phone, I took the Galaxy A8 because it sounded like a great phone for the price, and I love it right now.

The only problem is the battery. I find that it is losing battery extremely fast for a new phone. About 15-20% for an hour of using the phone only to configure stuff and install apps, and then about 15% lost over 6 hours of not using it.

Is that a normal rate for new phones? Am I already required to desactivate cool features such as the time showing up when idle and activate power saving mode just to get a decent time of usage?

I purchased my note 8 roughly 3 months ago and have really been enjoying the phone, which is why I was very disappointed today when, out of the blue, my phone screen went blank and never came back on.

Also when plugged in to the Samsung dex station I can mirror my phone onto my desktop as well as run the dex desktop.

I got a new Samsung 32 inch Smart TV, still under warranty and probably due to the thinness of the design (I never encountered this issue with other TVs but they are old and thick) I accidentally put some finger pressure on the screen and it created a small black spot. The SCREEN itself appears to work perfectly fine, as there are no dead pixels or anything. It’s just the backlighting on the small area is a bit dark.

So since I’m under warranty, and the sheet (backlight diffuser?) behind the actual screen appeared to have got dirt due to contact with the panel while it was on and warm I can just call the repairman and have the thing cleaned and it will be good as new right? And in case the sheet is damaged, hopefully the service center has a spare one?

It was a 32"" monitor and I no longer had the original shipping materials, so it was about 50 bucks for materials and shipping to them, but I digress. So after about two months I spoke to a rep and they were giving me a run-around that i needed to sign some form which would take two days to email. Ok, fine enough. Never heard from that rep again, and he ignored all further communication. Fast forward a week and still no email, I call again and and spoke to samsung (not the warranty dept) and they transfer me to a closed dept. 

Four days later I call again, this time telling me the monitor has shipped and would take 7-10 business days to arrive. Thank god! I call back on the 11th day just to get a tracking number because they said I would need to be home, and it was never emailed. Well turns out it wasn't shipped. So after 30 mins on the phone they promise that they spoke to the warehouse and that it would go out that day or the next and I would be emailed a tracking number on monday. Monday morning I email the new rep that gave me her email, and no reply, same for tuesday and wednesday. I finally hear from her today, thursday, and am told that it did not go out last week or at all and now I'm back at square one.

I have had over 10 calls to the warranty dept and samsung combined with three chats on the website ranging from late may til today. Total time spent on this is about 30 minutes per call. I'm at my wits end. I told them I don't care if if the same monitor, I just need a monitor back at this point. 

At this point I don't know what else to do. Contact the BBB and/or State Attourney General? Are there any samsung reps here that can get this fixed?",samsung,2018-07-05 18:08:33

8wdkbq,"I have been getting this error for a couple of weeks now. I've looked here and other places for possible fixes but nothing I'm trying seems to work. Let me give you a little history. 

My phone will charge just fine when plugged in to a normal wall charger. It used to charge just fine when plugged into my PC, portable charging brick or USB charging hub. When I started getting this error, it stopped working on everything but the wall charger. (sort of)

Now, I get a moisture detected error if I plug it in to anything other than the wall charger. It did not get wet. I've tried to dry it in rice, with a fan, etc. I've tried the deleting USB data and booting to safe mode fixes and they do not work. 

Now SOMETIMES, if I poke around the charging port lightly with a thin piece of plastic, it will charge on my USB charging hub or portable charging brick. It will still not work on my PC. But the weird thing is... if I manage to get it to work on one of those 2 things, the next time I plug it in to my regular wall charger, I get the moisture error. Then I have to unplug it and plug it right back in for it to start charging, which it does. And the other chargers will start giving me that error again. 

I don't think there is actually a moisture issue as the wall charger works perfectly. The 2 usb chargers that actually work sometimes require some poking around but they will always give me that error at first. 

None of the fixes I've seen online are working and I'm getting really frustrated. I don't mind plugging it in to the wall for now, but I like to know I can charge my phone on the go if I need to. The only other thing I can think of is around the same time I started getting this error, I also started getting another error when I plug it in to these same chargers. Something about Samsung Gear VR not being able to connect. I have never used Samsung Gear VR and never attempted to. It just gives me that error maybe once out of 10 times I plug it in to a USB charger (not the wall charger). Of course that's a SAMSUNG app so I can't uninstall it. I've tried to disable it but it doesn't stop the moisture error.

8wpszk,"Hi guys,

Tonight I checked my email to be quite disappointed. For a little background info, I decided to buy an S9 from Samsung.com and I sent them my old iPhone 6 to save $75. I brought the iPhone to a Fed Ex ship center and packaged it in a small, bubble-wrapped envelope. The last time I laid my eyes on it, the phone was in pretty decent condition. The screen had absolutely no cracks and the body was in a fair and acceptable condition. I naively did not take any pictures because I saw this situation as unlikely, and had to much faith in the system.

When I received the pictures from Samsung, the screen had a huge crack near the top of it. Now, my $75 iPhone is worth $25. Is it possible it was damaged in shipping? If so, is there anything I can do about it? Would I be able to receive any compensation from Fed Ex? On the other hand, is there any sort of way I can make an appeal with Samsung?

I'm unfortunately feeling like there's nothing I can do, but it's very frustrating being that I would have rathered just keep the phone to use as an mp3 if it would only be worth $25. I'll take any possible solutions gratefully.

- back of phone is shattered (can barely tell with the case on though)
- some pretty heavy amoled screen burn but phone is still usable
- battery life aint what it used to be.

My phone provider has a pretty cool deal going today only. I can get a new Samsung phone on a new 2 year contract for $100 off, plus I get 2 GB bonus data for free with my new plan.

I'm looking at both the S9+ , and the Note 8 and not sure which one would be better for me.. I'm an amateur musician and author, so I'm not sure which phone is better for the ""creative person"" though I like that they both have nice large screens and I like the stereo speakers on the 9+

My other option is to be rid of my contract , get a new plan for half of what I'm paying now, and keep the S7 for 2 more years and hope it lasts.   Any advice ? Is the S7 gonna last much longer ? Is the 9+ or note8 really gonna wow me a lot if I choose to upgrade? Any advice is appreciated!

I have a refurbished Samsung S7 Edge I bought maybe two months ago (I know its not current gen, but I have a budget. The volume button cave in and as a consequence the phone keeps rebooting into safe mode. I initially contacted Samsung support via chat. I carefully  explained the situation, being explicit about the condition of the phone. The representative at chat assured me repair would be covered under warranty free of charge. He filled out a ticket and sent a free UPS label. I sent the phone back. About three-four days later I received an e-mail from Samsung with an invoice for $0.00 for the repair.

About a week goes by after that and I still haven't received my phone back or any further communication from Samsung, so I initiated another chat looking for an update. The representative on chat told me the repair was on hold due to a ""payment processing issue"". I asked for more detail about this and for him to confirm whether or not they were showing I owed them anything and if I did owe anything, how much. They told me they did not have access to this information and to call 800-SAMSUNG.

I called 800-SAMSUNG and spoke with a representative who told me the same thing, the repair was on hold due to a ""payment processing issue"". I asked this representative the same thing, if confirm whether or not they showed I owed anything and if so how much. I was told them don't have access to this information either. I was told I'd need to speak a different facility for this information, however being a Saturday afternoon, they were closed for the weekend. I asked for a direct number to this facility so I could call on Monday. I was told they do not have a direct phone number. I was instructed to call back to 800-SAMSUNG on Monday.

I called 800-SAMSUNG on Monday. Was told the same thing as before, they did not access to see whether or not I owed them anything (which is absolutely bizarre). I was told again I'd need to speak with this other facility. This time I was provided a direct phone number to reach them, 877-467-3322. I called this number and it took me 10+ minutes on hold to get through to somebody. The first time, when the line connected to a live person, all I got was ""Hello?"" then the line disconnected. I immediately called back and after another 10+ minutes of holding, and got a rep. I asked them the same question, do they or do they not show that I owe them anything for this repair, and if so how much? I was told by this representative that they did not have access to this information either. She told me she could e-mail another department for an answer, but it'd be two-three business days for a response. At this point I was understandably livid and asked for a supervisor. I was told by this rep  ""we don't have supervisors here"". This is an exact quote and not an exaggeration or paraphrase. I called her out on this. You most certainly do have a supervisor. The rep continued to deny she has a supervisor then transferred me back to 800-SAMSUNG while I was mid-sentence.

I explained the briefly explained to the 800-SAMSUNG rep and then asked to speak a supervisor. She told me sure then put me on an extended mute. She came back and told me the cost of my repair was $70 and change, but she'd happy to discount it for me. I told this was a nice gesture, but I don't feel I should owe them anything, and asked for supervisor a second time. The rep then disconnected without saying anything.

About five minutes later a supervisor called me back. She told me that my phone was out of warranty because of its condition. The reasons she cited for this were a. damage to the screen and b. damage to the volume down button. I told her there was no damage to the screen whatsoever prior to me sending this back to them. If they are saying there is damage to the screen, this is objectively false. I also explained her stating its out of warranty due to the volume button being damaged is bizarre as I had made the first rep I chatted with explicitly aware of this, This was, in fact, the very reason I sent it for them for repair in the first place! I also reviewed the fact I was assured there'd be no cost to me and that I had previously received a $0.00 invoice. The supervisor then told me, right, normally this would've cost me $70 and change, however it looks like someone had previously already discounted the ticket for the full repair cost. She gave me a date for when it was first discounted. The date she gave me matched the date I received the $0.00 invoice. I asked, if there were the case, why the very first rep I spoke with either on chat or the phone, or any the subsequent reps I spoke with, were unable to provide me with this info? Why did I have to go through seven levels of customer service hell to find out I was owe them nothing? The supervisor did not have an answer for this. Just said she couldn't speak to what other reps would have told me. I asked her if the repair was on hold. She told me it was not, that it was still in progress. I asked her if she could give me an estimated time-frame for when I'd get my phone back. She just gave me general information: repairs usually take 5-7 business days that I'd get an e-mail when I shipped out. I found this answer to be a bit wishy-washy, especially since it had already been 5-7 business days since I sent it back, but I let it go because I had already spent close to two hours on the phone at this point. I guess I'll just wait and see if I ever get my phone back. Honestly, if I had my way at this point, I'd ask them just to keep the thing and provide me a full refund so I can go buy a phone through someone else, but I know they'd never go for that.

Anyone else have any experience escalating issues with Samsung customer service? Any suggestions? I was thinking about possibly taking to Twitter? Anyone know of any better channels? ",samsung,2018-07-09 18:25:31

8xk9an,"I have a Samsung Galaxy S5, running haggertk's unofficial Lineage OS 15.1 ROM. I've had this issue a month ago, and three days ago. The first time this issue appeared, the phone won't charge at all. So I removed the battery for a couple of hours and tried to charge it, and voilà! It started to charge again. Second time, a few days ago, it happened again. So I removed the battery overnight and tried to reinsert it the morning after that. No issues. The phone charged. Now, it happened again (that was on a span of 4 days after the second time it happened).

I'm pretty certain it is not my cable's fault since I've tried all of the available cables and chargers. I've also hooked it to my laptop which it recognises but throws me an error saying ""Device descriptor failed"". I've also hooked it to my power bank. The power bank lights up, meaning there
was contact, but not charging. Also, when I try to charge my phone when it is off, it proceeds to the charging icon. Then it will proceed to the battery indicator, but the battery indicator doesn't animate. Then it will restart and do the same process again.

I could charge the phone off of an external charger but I really need to know what the hell is the problem. I also remember, I ordered a port cover and tried to test its water resistance by spraying water on the phone's port area. I'm sure no water came in since the insides were dry. I also cleaned the port using 70% alcohol solution and a cotton. I've also checked if the phone's contacts were bent which I'm glad were not. So it all comes down to two culprits: the daughterboard and the battery.

8xovgw,"I've always used Samsung phones but I've always been able to find custom roms that work properly. 

I have a Note FE (after having the Note 7 taken away) and it's still my favorite. 

But... I can't use it as my daily phone. The default DPI is 411. For a phone with a screen this size it's stupid. Everything is huge. I like to have it set to 550 to make use of the screen.

But upping the DPI breaks everything made by Samsung.

Phone app: visual/animation glitches. 
Camera app: visual/animation glitches.
AOD: Crashes when opening AOD settings (fixed in latest version)
AOD: Increasing DPI (Making things smaller) makes the AOD BIGGER! Instead of smaller. 
Samsung Keyboard: Don't get me started. Just use the Google keyboard.

So yeah. I find it really frustrating because I LOVE the phone but I literally cannot use it with these issues. I know it's a first world problem but I have a OnePlus and it works much better, but I'd much prefer the Note FE if it worked.

I know I could replace the dialer, use a different camera app, disable AOD and use the Google keyboard but I like a lot of these features, especially AOD. And also, for such an expensive phone, Samsung should be developing their applications properly. There's no excuse in 2018 for their software to not be DPI aware. 

So that's my rant. Just thought I'd post and see if anyone agrees or maybe have some solutions. I'll probably end up selling the phone though. :( It would be nice if Samsung could see this and push updates to fix the issues but I know it won't happen. :(

8y02da,"Right, I've had a pretty torrid experience with Samsung the past 7 months and I want to tell you all what happened and see if any of you have been through anything similar and how you resolved the issue.

 

It all started in November, I purchased a pretty 50 inch Phillips Ambilight that had terrible banding issues to the point that 4K, HD and SD were unwatchable. I decided to return it to the retailer and bought a 55mu7000 with at first I was overjoyed with. After a few days of usage a friend came round and noticed clumps of dead pixels to the corners of the TV, I had a repairman from Samsung come out who replaced the screen which had even more dead pixels and they didn't even bother to contact me back after promising me they would.

 

Here's where a little silver lining happened. Samsung phoned me after I chased them around ten days later, offering me a 55Q8FAM which I was pleasantly surprised about. I unboxed it, set it up and could not beleive how lucky I was to get this expensive model. After a week however, I was watching the champions league when the dreaded vertical lines started appearing. Samsung proceeded to remote into my television and advised me that everything was fine with the unit, I took their word for it as I thought I may be over careful due to the issues I had before.

 

Three months later the lines got worse, forcing me to contact Samsung support again, to be told there was no issue and they couldn't just replace it as it was past the 28 day period. After a lot of back and forth with their customer relations team I managed to get them to agree to a replacement. Brilliant, I thought. Oh how I was wrong.

 

Please see the attached image to see just how bad my current unit is. Would any of you put up with the state of that and is it as bad as I feel it is? I'm currently in touch with the President however I feel I'm being brushed aside, rather than offer me a replacement as a good will gesture they are offering me a refund of the original price I paid for the MU7000. Any and all advise would be appreciated in solving this matter.

I have had the S8 for little over a year now and with this past update I have been experiencing a few problems. I was wondering if you guys have also been having these/ might know some solutions. 

1) If I have the phone plugged in and restart it, the Samsung logo will appear but that's it. The phone will black out and vibrate a little. Then couple seconds later it will vibrate again and the logo will appear just for it to keep repeating this process till I unplug the phone. Now once it's unplugged it will complete the restart. 

2) My fast charging have ""quit"" working. I say ""quit"" because if I plug the phone in it will start charging and say fast charging, but a few seconds later it will vibrate again and show the charing annotation but change from fast charging to just regular charging. Yet the estimated time till fully charged will be the same. 

For both of these I hate treid different cables and charging bricks. I have multiple Samsung bricks and I either use aukey/Anker cables or Samsung's cables. I've also wiped cache partition and the problem still persist.

3. This isn't as important, but ESPN notifications won't show up, I've tried to uninstall and reinstall and I made sure the app isnt in the always sleeping state, but they still don't show up.

These past several months though have been just awful.  I will start up a show on Netflix, and about 3 minutes into the episode it disconnects me from my network.   I will then attempt to re-connect to the Network, but my 5GHz no longer displays.  The solution for this is to either  

A) turn off the TV for several minutes and turn it back on  

B) Connect to my 2.4GHz, disconnect from that, then my 5GHz will re-appear.  

Once I am reconnected to the internet, I get about 3-5 minutes of show time before it cuts out again.  This happens with all streaming apps on the television.   Why not use my 2.4GHz connection you ask? Well, despite the fact that I can browse YouTube while on the 2.4GHz connection, it acts as if it's entirely disconnected from the internet otherwise. Netflix just tells me I am not connected, Prime won't load, and Hulu asks me to connect to a network. 

There is no issue with the Router/Modem or anything else.  In the house we have 2 computers, 2 cell phones, a Wii, and my series 1 Amazon Firestick.  Using Netflix through the Firestick has absolutely no problems what so ever. I can start up a show, watch 3 episodes, and by morning still be connected to Netflix.  The Firestick though cannot handle Plex, and since it's a series 1 it takes a good 15-20 minutes to even load up, so it's really not a feasible option. 

Whatever this issue is; has something to do with the television set itself.  Samsungs error tries to pin the blame on my ISP by saying ""Problem with your network connection? Contact your ISP!"" 

The whole ordeal is super frustrating, and I am hoping that someone has some sort of solution to frequent disconnects with their Samsung SmartTV.

Except it turns out that as it's from a different market, Samsung Pay won't accept the details of a card from my country. And that's ok, too, I don't want to use it anyway... except I cant turn it off. Since it won't accept a card, it won't let me into app proper where presumably I can tell it not to bother me.  I keep getting that transparent pop up tab under the app tray on my home screen. Currently I just go into settings - apps - Samsung pay and force stop every few days when it inevitably pops up again.

8yibym,"Hey, so I was using my s8 just as normal when I noticed the screen to start flickering black lines out of nowhere, at first I thought it was just the app so I closed it and the problem seemed to go away. However after a few minutes the problem escalated and instead of black likes my phone seemed to start flickering bright green lines uncontrollably for around 5 seconds which after would leave the phones display very saturated, the weird part is, is that this wasn't permanent, at points the display would be fine 

Anyway, after many different issues, the current state of the phone is that whenever I unlock it, it does the green flickering and then either fixes itself and goes to normal or the screen goes a red-ish tint, sometimes with faint dark lines across the screen or goes to a saturated display with a green tint

This problem seems like a hardware issue but the fact that around 15% of the time it is completely normal makes me think it may be software

8yiq8i,"I'm deeply disappointed in Samsung right now. There's been a great app, Samsung Focus - must-have if you work in a corporate environment where Exchange email system is used. This is the first and only Exchange-enabling e-mail app that I found to work well. Why? Because unlike the official Outlook app, and most of the other Exchange-enabled email apps, it allowed me to:

* Sync contacts to my actual contacts (not a separate contact book)
* Sync selected calendars to my actual phone calendar (not in a separate, in-app only calendar)
* Have a nice overview of actually important stuff (Outlook can do this to some extent, but not as well as Focus)

And so many other things. It just felt more of a first-class citizen on my Samsung phone than anything other.

8yk7je,"So today I was watching Netflix and I live in an apartment the modern one with windows everywhere so people outside my apartment in the nearby apartments can see what were watching, while watching the movie at some point it started randomly fast forwarding or rewinding and we were holding the remote in our hands trying to stop it so that means no one was sitting on the remote or anything, and I told my gf that maybe someone used a remote app on their phone to do this because I had seen someone do this with their phone before and we suddenly started looking around and when we turned around someone in the apartment next to us quickly hid his head behind the curtain when he saw us look at him, I think he might be using his phone app as a remote to do things on my tv, especially since as soon as we closed the curtains it stopped, so now I know he couldn't have a same remote or something to do that because the apartments are too far apart but a phone signal might be able to cross that distance, so I think it's probably his phone.

So now I want to know first how can i know if a phone remote is connected to my tv and second how to disconnect that or completely disable that function. Or is it even possible otherwise if it's not possible what should I do to stop this from happening, 

I want contacting the other apartment and complaining to be the last resort because that might make things worse in the long run if they get offended and now start doing it all the time, also I have no evidence he actually did it that's why I want to know how to check if someone's connected to it

And also if it's just a really long range special remote he bought then I want to know how to if possible to disable remote control as a whole on my smart tv

I have a Samsung smart tv (the one that curves around) i can check the exact model if that would help but I think they are all pretty similar.

After I sold it I was researching a bit further about security, and I found out about FRP.

Now I am worried the person may not be able to use the phone without signing in to my Google account?

NOTE: I did complete the factory restore and then went through the setup process just skipping everything I could, did NOT connect to wi-fi etc. I was able to get to the home screen and was not asked to sign into Google at any point, and I confirmed that my data was gone (phone was 64gb, showed 56gb available). Then I did another factory reset so the buyer could go through the setup themselves.

Am I worried over nothing, or will this person not be able to access the phone? When is the FRP triggered, is it only when connected to wifi and/or inserting a SIM?

I haven't heard anything from the buyer, they were pretty excited about getting the phone so I guess they would have been through setup by now. I might send a message tonight to make sure they could set it up all OK?

8ytrdh,"On Wednesday July 11th, I was browsing Samsung website. I was looking at the phones and noticed a 200$ off coupon for the galaxy s9 if it was for Verizon.

Now I've been very unhappy with AT&amp;T and have been planning to switch, not to mention I'm still on my parents plan so I needed to start my own anyways. So with my current phone on the verge of death, this coupon was the last little nudge I needed to switch to Verizon.

I want through the purchasing process. I selected the Galaxy s9 for 720$. I applied the coupon to make it 520$. I could trade in my old phone for 75$ making the total down to 450$ plus Samsung was going to give me a free 64g memory chip! Great. Now issues.

Then I need to log in, which I do. Keep in mind the order isn't yet in my cart. Okay now I need to link my Verizon account. What? Read terms and condition of the promotion and it said that a Verizon account isn't required at purchase, as long as I sign up with Verizon promptly after otherwise the coupon gets removed after the fact. Okay that's fair.

So there's two buttons. Sign in to Verizon account, or I don't have an account. So I click I don't have an account. Then I need to type in the zip code I'll mainly use the phone in. Then I type in a whole bunch of personal info. All still on the sumsung website. 

Turns out that's the application for the phone. To get the 0% apt for 24 months with 0$ down I needed to do a credit app. Again, that's okay. I have great credit. I submit the app and it says Verizon needs to talk to you, please call Verizon number and give them this app number. The instructions also state once this is finished, click continue to add order to cart.

Talk to Verizon and there was a small hiccup because I had a credit freeze so I had to get that removed then call Verizon back to confirm. I do that and they say I'm approved and I'm okay to proceed.

I click the next button on the Samsung website. Nothing happens. Click again. Nothing. Wut. Okay over the next couple hours, I redo the entire process on 2 different web browsers using my phone work computer and home computer, and cleared cookies and caches in between. All of them get to the same point and shows the original application I'd. Again, wut.

I call Verizon back and they assured me I'm good. It's a glitch with Samsung. I literally spend HOURS with Samsung on the phone being transferred multiple times between their sales, e-commerce, activations, and tech support departments. Every depart says they can't do it and one of the others have to fix it. No one tries to help, no one really does anything. They basically said hi how can I help, I tell them the whole story, and they say they have to transfer me.


By now I'm fed up, I use their online chat so I can at least know who I'm talking too. Reexplain everything, first person disconnects on their own and gets a second person. Second person helps me troubleshoot to no success. He finally says only way to help is to end the chat and to respond to the confirmation email with a screenshot of where I'm stuck. Then I'd get a response to help.

I said I didn't want to do that because the coupon expired today. The rep promised this was the only way and that they would help me. So foolishly I close the chat. I get an email with a full transcript which is nice and I respond to it with the screenshot as instructed.

 It's been days and nothing. No phone. No response. Coupon now expired. I feel like this is deception and or false advertising. What can I do? I don't know if Samsung employees run this or frequent this sub, but I know on other subs there are employees that will chime on to help. I need to know how to resolve this and get the coupon that I wasn't able to get. ",samsung,2018-07-14 14:48:17

Android Oreo được cập nhật cho Galaxy S7 và Galaxy S7 với khoảng 1,7 GB. Ngoài những tính năng gốc mà Google đã đưa vào Oreo, phần mềm mới lặp lại bao gồm giao diện người mua trải nghiệm 9.0 của Samsung (mà bạn mang thể đã thấy trên họ Galaxy S9 ). Hơn nữa, bản cập nhật này còn tương trợ GSMA Universal Profile 1.0, cho phép truyền tệp lên đến 100 MB qua tin nhắn.

I'm finally giving in and admitting I need to upgrade my phone. I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini right now (which was discontinued when I got it), and I've replaced the battery and added a micro-SD card, but it's just too slow to keep up anymore, and freezes constantly when I use google maps or check transit apps for the bus, let alone things like messenger and texting. Streaming video and music still works, but it heats my phone up like crazy, to the point I take it out of it's otterbox because it will refuse to charge from the heat and makes my fingers hurt when I touch it. (And I'm a barista. I know hot finger pain.)

SO, I'm going to upgrade, but I'm stuck between the Pixel 2 and the Samsung S9, based on what I've read/heard about them. (I know neither of them will fit in my pocket, which is the real bummer here.) I don't know much about electronics, and I'm really looking for the idiot-proof version of help to decide here. They're close enough in price through Verizon that it's not a huge factor here for me. I know that the real drawback for google is it doesn't have a headphone jack and screen burn, while the S9 is the battery and updates.

I really just want a phone I can play stupid games on, that might stay in my back pocket when I crouch, with a nice camera that I can take 600-1200 DPI photos of my illustrations with, and will play spotify while I sleep without me having to worry about setting my sheets on fire.

I'm open to other models as suggestions, but I don't want an iPhone at all, and Verizon needs to carry it. (They're literally the only one with reception at my parents house, which I still spend time at regularly, and it's barely even there.)

When trying to select display mode Film/Movie all screen goes black, freezes and starts to show lines of various colors across the screen.

I opened a chat at Samsungs website, described the problem, showed a photo. But to no help, I only got a referral to a phone number for a local engineer to visit me and look at the issue, at an extra cost of course.   


I then found a simple Youtube-clip, that explained how to reset the Smart TV device with the remote, by pressing Info - menu - Mute and then Power on. Through the factory menu I managed to reset my device back to factory settings. Software version is however still the faulty one.  


When the device was new, I could use the 3D mode fine, but the resent versions have destroyed my smart tv device completely rendering it useless for the purpose I bought it, to watch 3D movies.   


How do I revert back to a working firmware / software? (The device seem to update itself, so I have no control over it)   


On a sidenote, it has also begun ""ghosting"" lately, where it turns itself on after being in stand by mode for about 15-30 minutes. it does not start fully all the time, sometimes it is only the display that turns on, without loading in channels or software.

In a moment of panic they gave me the choice and as a reservation i calculated and went with the normal pattern on avoid the plane Jane color and going for the fun one.

I didn't realise until i set up the phone and watched a few more videos on the S8. I FUCKED UP lol.

Will i ever get over this? 

Maybe there's a light in the tunnel. Certainly every person who bought a Galaxy S8+ most got the black. So i could be the rarity. Of all the other colors i kinda like Orchid Grey i guess because it kinda has this changing personality.... I dunno purple is good too.

90dqzb,"Hello, as seen in the title, my regular S8 suddenly green screened and now the screen will not respond. Shortly(i.e about and hour or so before hand) before the green screen itself, there appeared to be an odd flickering of the screen that would go away when i put the phone to sleep and woke it back up. After the green screen, the phone blacked out and will not respond to anything, though holding down the power button does get a small vibrate, and I'm scared to go into recovery mode as if the screen doesn't work then, i might absolutely wreck the phone without knowing it.

I also think it might help to mention that i had given the screen a mildy bad crack on the corner of the screen today outside, and some water may have gotten on/in the crack itself.

Anyone with a S9 how is it in comparison to the S8? Or should I save a bit of money and get the bigger screen of the S8+? Price range they're about similar so I've been tossing between the two of them.

I'm renting a new home with an outlet hardwired where I'd like to install the television above the fireplace. There is also a porthole (for lack of a better term) where an HDMI cable comes through and is fed through to the right and at the bottom of the adjoining wall (where I'd plug it into a cable box). However, it seems like the HDMI cord is anchored in place against the frame so I can't feed more HDMI cords through (or remove the existing cord) and I'd like to also connect a PS4 Pro and Nintendo to my television.
An HDMI hub at the bottom of the wall where the HDMI pokes through to connect to a cable box etc. seems to be the logical solution. The issue here is that the TV I have is a Samsung MU model that has an HDMI itself and connects to the TV through a Samsung ""One Connect"" cable. The TV itself has no place to plug in an HDMI cord, it's all through the One Connect hub.
If I use an HDMI hub, will I still be able to switch inputs to the PS4, Nintendo etc. using the TV. Or will the TV read me pressing input as switching the inputs on the One Connect hub (and therefore switch to an input with nothing plugged into it since, as I mentioned, it seems like I'm only limited to one HDMI cord thanks to the stupidity of whoever built this house).",samsung,2018-07-21 02:01:03

90rnig,"I'm posting this just in case anyone has a similar issue and seeks a remedy to it.

I bought my Note 8 using the Shop Samsung app back in January 2018. They had a much better deal than T-Mobile did at the time including a great trade-in offer ($350 for my S7 Edge, a discounted price, and free AKG Bluetooth headphones.) 

I got the phone and sent in my S7 Edge as a trade-in either in late January or early February.  The basics of the trade-in was a ""functional screen"" and ""normal wear and tear.""  The screen part of the contract specifically states that the screen is to have no cracks (which my phone did not). 

Fast forward four months to June 2018 and I get an email stating that my S7 Edge did not meet minimum requirements for the trade-in offer and that Samsung would be charging back $325 of the $350 trade-in value of my phone. 

I emailed the CSR and tried to find out the specifics of the issues they had with the phone. After repeated emails back and forth, they had two issues with the phone. The first was apparently burn-in on the screen. I can say the phone did have a slight amount of burn-in at the top where the notification bar is located, but that it  was very difficult to see the burn-in unless you were really looking for it. The second issue they had was ""damage to the chassis"" which I knew immediately what they were talking about. My phone had a very, very small nick on the left aluminum side rail.

To me, both of those issues were part of normal wear and tear since no one's phone is perfect and burn-in and amoled displays go together like peas and carrots.

I ended up contacting and submitting a claim through the Better Business Bureau on New Jersey where Samsung's US headquarters is located. It took about three weeks, but I recently got an email from Samsung through the BBB, that they were cancelling the $325 chargeback as a ""one-time adjustment."" 

Next time, I will be taking photos of the entire phone before sending it in, if I trust Samsung at all next time with a trade-in.

Basically, my samsung note 5 stopped charging because something was wrong with the port on it. I decided that even tho I had this problem, I'd still stick with Samsung. I got the Samsung galaxy s8 plus and under a year later the phone starts having problems with charging. It wont charge and when I attempt to charge it, it smells like smoke and like something is on fire. The charger becomes hot to the touch as well. 

I'm using the charger that came with the phone. I also tried a new charger incase it was the charger, did the same thing. I go to at&amp;t and they basically tell me I'd have to go to samsung to get them to either fix or replace the phone. Even though I have insurance on the phone. I ask them if they would provide a loaner phone while mine is being repaired they say no. I ask if I can trade the phone in they say not until more than half the phone is paid off because I'm on a payment plan for it. 

I contact samsung they tell me that I have to send in the phone but delete everything off the phone first and back it up. How am I supposed to do that when the port doesn't work? I say ok, but do I get a replacement phone first? They say at&amp;t will give me a loaner phone. I tell them at&amp;t said they dont do that. He says I'd have to contact at&amp;t still to get a loaner phone. I ask if the phone is covered under warranty, they say it's under a year so as long as the phone doesn't have water damage then I probably wont pay anything. 


At this point I'm fed up with Samsung and at&amp;t and I just want to return the phone and get the money I've paid for the phone back to use for a different phone. Is there anyone who knows what my options are at this point? Or anyone who had something similar happen?

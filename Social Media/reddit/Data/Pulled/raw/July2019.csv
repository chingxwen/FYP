c7gu1y,"A friend just gave me their old Samsung J7 Prime and since I’ve had it, it’s worked pretty well aside from some charging issues. 

No matter what I do, it will not increase in charge while it’s on, only when it’s off. I’ve tried clearing cache, rebooting, even resetting the phone and nothing is helping. 

I’ve used different chargers, different wall sockets, literally nothing is working. Does anyone know how to fix this problem? Will I have to take it into a Samsung store to get it fixed?",samsung,2019-07-01 01:04:28

Also, TCL lets you download any system updates to a USB and install it that way. Any experience doing that with Samsung?

c7if53,"So Just got my S10e, all going well, great phone so far. However my one major annoyance is the constant notification that pops up every 10 minutes that says 'Tap here to use your Samsung account'.

I've googled it and it appears I'm not the only one. I'm at the point of using adb to kill the off the samsung package that is causing it. However, this is where my knowledge of adb ends, I'm not sure what to kill (and don't really want to remove anything that the phone depends on to operate properly).

Is it com.samsung.android.mobileservice or something under that?",samsung,2019-07-01 03:25:02

c7lmun,"First off, I'm pretty tech savvy, but I just can't seem to fix this problem. At first I had my tv connected via HDMI Arc to my Vizio 5.1 sound bar, and NO MATTER WHAT tv audio setting I had it in, it would constantly cut of audio for a second or so every 1 - 5 minutes.. it was insanely frustrating. It especially would cut off when I had it on Dolby Digital.. the ONLY settings that it would cut off less on was when I had both audio settings on my tv set to PCM, but then the audio was kind of blurry, as in it was harder to really make out what words where being spoken. And yes, I've done ALL the factory resets on the sound bar already. I even purchased a new HDMI cable and the same thing happened. My tv is new also. I then tried my Xbox 360's Netflix app, and same thing happened. SO, I switched over to optical and again audio skipping on Dolby digital output on my tv just.. less skipping than on HDMI Arc. SO I bought a new optical cable, and the same thing happened. So, now.. last resort, I switch my audio settings to PCM and PCM and somehow that almost fully worked.. now instead of second long skipping every 1 - 5 minutes, it's about one time every hour or so. Better, but no. I want NO skipping, ever. I am not willing to settle, considering the amount I paid for this sound bar. This entire time I was testing it with the built in Samsung Netflix app, which I heard was glitchy with sound bars... so... could THAT be it? After finding that out online, I went to Netflix in my Xbox 360 which is connected via HMDI (not Arc) to my tv, So the Xbox 360's audio is now going to my tv, and from my tv to the sound bar via Optical. You know whats been confusing me forever? My Samsung tv has TWO audio settings... almost everybody has just one from what I've seen online.. HDMI Input Audio Format, the options are: PCM and Bitstream and I also have Digital Output Audio Format, the options are: PCM, Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital+ (Which my sound bar doesn't accept) DTS (Which never seems to be selectable, it's just greyed out), and DTS Neo 2:5 (Which is always selectable, but I hate how it sounds, so I've avoided that one... I haven't tried it on optical yet though, just HDMI Arc.) I need to be clearly explained what are the differences and purposes between the HDMI Input Audio Format and the Digital Output Audio Format.. What do they both individually do, and in HDMI Input Audio Format what is the difference between Bitstream and PCM? What do they both do? ....OK so I set the HDMI Input Audio Format to Bitstream and the Digital Output Audio Format to PCM. and the Xbox 360's audio settings are: Digital Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby Digital with WMA Pro ...and I set it to Dolby Digital 5.1 and it actually didn't skip... BUT  after an hour of everything going good, I was watching Avengers Endgame and an anime with the Netflix setting set to English (5.1) and it didn't skip for a second.. but the volume instead, lowered itself for a second. Which is why I said it ""dimmed"" in the title.. which is... weird.. and still unacceptable. Again, I want it to work perfectly. But.. I do actually LOVE the way PCM on Digital Output Audio Format sounds via Optical.. It's so raw and clear and doesn't sound so ""edited"". It feels like I'm in a theater listening to the sound the way it was intended to be heard.. it even sounds better to me than dolby digital via HMDI Arc, which makes it sound like I'm listen to the movie through over priced headphones that slightly over ""edit"" the sound slightly instead of leaving the sound the way the sound engineers intended it to be listened to.. but that's just my personal opinion from what I hear.. So I love PCM via optical and am hoping I can keep it, (Though, Ill happily use Dolby Digital if I can get it to work perfectly) but at this point? I just want to find SOME setting that will just work and never skip or dim in audio that allows me to get 5.1 surround sound no matter what. 5.1 surround sound is also very important to me considering I payed extra for a sound bar just to get 5.1 instead of a way cheaper 2.0 sound bar.. so I would like to retain those features if possible, while getting the best sound I can. So NOW, I changed the HDMI Input Audio Format to PCM on my tv.. and am going to watch something else again on Netflix as a test with all the settings the same except for that one change.. Both the HDMI Input Audio Format and the Digital Output Audio Format is set to PCM now via Optical, with the Netflix setting set to English (5.1) I'll update, to see what happens... This has been about 2 or so months of trial and error, I even replaced the first very same sound bar to see is it was just defective or a dud that I had bought from Walmart online, and the second sound bar that was replaced by Vizio using my warranty WAS skipping way less via HDMI Arc.. but it was still skipping.. which is the sound bar I currently have now. I do think the first sound bar was defective though, this one that I have currently seems to have hope... I. just. need. the. right. audio. settings. I'm going insane at this point. lol and I'm going to go even more insane if I have to watch Avengers Infinity War again.. which is the movie I was using to test the sound bars on these last 2 months, because it has the perfect amount of normal volume talking, loud shouting, loud orchestral music, subtle orchestral music, loud explosions, low explosions, subtle sounds, huge battles, normal like every other action movie sounding fight scenes, and basically all the sounds of the average ""movie experience"" all rolled into one movie .. I almost memorized every line.. I've even noticed the CGI mistakes.. the background actors that are smiling when they shouldn't be.. the ADR that sounds out of place.. this sound bar has made me sick of Infinity War.. and I used to love that movie. Great. Thanks Vizio sound bar. lol


OH and to add upon that I also have an android tv box that I have no idea what settings to set it to. I am thinking about buying an Xbox One X and using an HDMI splitter to send all of my HDMI devices through my Xbox One X and then connect my optical cable to the back of the Xbox One X to send all of my audio to my sound bar.. BUT.. I'm ify on that, as I don't want my Xbox One to be on all day long just because I want to watch a device that's connected through it... you know? Also, what audio settings would I need to put on my Xbox One X to make it work perfectly with my sound bar in the future? Just out of curiosity? Oh and my Wii is connected via component cables to the back of my Samsung tv, and it cuts off audio ALOT with optical as well.. about every 1 - 5 minutes, regardless of what audio option I give it.. It only works fine when I convert the wii RCA red and white cables audio to 3.5mm and plug it into the 3.5mm input on my sound bar.. THEN it works and doesn't skip... also no my tv doesn't have a 3.5 mm output or an RCA output for some dumb reason.. I'm stuck with and limited to either HDMI Arc or Optical.. and so far optical seems to be the ONLY ONE that is giving me semi hope here. 


Can someone give me exact settings to set everything to to make this all work? I really don't want to have to rely on an Xbox One.. Also can some explain to me what these settings mean? I HAVE google searched them, but the explanations always seem so vague, and usually the tvs they give explanation examples with never have HDMI input Audio Format... JUST Digital Output Audio Format.. which makes things even more confusing to understand what I'm working with. I have a slight vague idea of everything, but nothing clearly explained to me yet.. I need to know what I'm working with to find a solution. In all, money is really tight right now, and I'm hoping that I don't have to end up returning this and buying something more expensive in the end..

All help I can get is very much appreciated. Thanks to everyone in advance! and sorry for writing so much, but I really had no choice if I wanted to explain everything clearly.

c7pioa,"Background: I have two HDDs that I've had since about 2008, 500 GB and 1 TB in storage size. They have AC adapters and require microUSB cables, making them a hassle to keep track of.  
  
I've almost maxed them out, along with maxing out a 512 GB EVO card that I use for my Android work. I wanted to consolidate everything into a 4 TB+ SSD that I could use for my routine day-to-day organizing and also archive files. I was looking at a Samsung EVO drive to meet these needs.

My friend has been hawking on the value of SSD for the past decade, but only now did I realize he was talking about internal SSD. I've only used external devices, and I still only need them.

Looking on Amazon and similar websites, there doesn't seem to be much market for ""external"" drives, and Google tells me there's no benefit to using SSD over HDD for long term storage. I did see a ""Samsung T5 Portable SSD - 2TB"" but it apparently has its own management software? I'm not looking for that. I'm looking for a dumb drive that I can just throw data on.

Basically, a microSD card but scaled up to 4 TB would be ideal for me, because it doesn't need power or cables. After that would be something big that's USB powered. I like SD cards because when I upgrade, I can reuse the card in a phone, instead of having to get rid of it outright. But SanDisk's A2 SD cards are not supported in any phone right now, and might never be depending on where technology goes in what I expect to be the lifetime for my new drive (10-20 years). 

SanDisk also just released the 1 TB and it's sold out. The SSD from Samsung is only 2 TB, has a management firmware and supposedly has no additional value over an HDD. And the HDD I see available on Amazon (WD 6TB Elements Desktop Hard Drive) I've had fail on me before. It's cheaply made and not reliable.

I would prefer Samsung products since I have an ecosystem of Samsung as well as an account with them. I'm looking for any advice: takes on SSD/HDD for my uses, Samsung vs other OEMs, multiple devices or any other ideas.",samsung,2019-07-01 15:17:44

Samsung UK Support redirected me to Hanaro in the Netherlands. They have the least structured RMA process I have ever experienced, making it very difficult to go through the process, probably hoping the customer gives up.

They had no solution in place for a storage device that has data on it which the customer is unable to delete (I was copying client data from one machine to another, thus GDPR relevant). They verbally assured me they would not look at the data, but I was unable to get that in writing. 

After many messages back and forth, signing several documents, sending multiple images, I got them to agree that I would provide proof of destruction of the USB flash drive, and I did. But I still had to send that to the Netherlands.

Finally, having sent the leftovers of the flash drive (a little bag with shredded bits) to Hanaro in the Netherlands over 10 days ago, they now claim they never received it. I intentionally sent it via normal letter, as any option to send this tracked to the Netherlands would not have been reasonable versus the item's value. Of course, and frankly as expected after this discouraging RMA process, they ""never received it"", ""can I provide proof of delivery?"". Yes, it is possible that they actually have not received it, but frankly it is unlikely. They probably treat most of their non-tracked arrivals like that, conveniently saving money. - 

It's not really about the money / replacement anymore. I thought I quickly have it replaced, but then got sucked into that crazy RMA process, fascinated how bad things could actually be. I hope Samsung UK takes note.

c8hfgj,"I'm due for a new phone with mine running an outdated system, but I can't seem to find anything that fits my requirements. My old phone is a Samsung Galaxy S7 Active.  Unfortunately, it looks like I'm not going to be getting a Samsung or anything because no one has made a better phone (for my purposes) since the S7 Active phone. 

Prove me wrong, convert me back, help!

&amp;#x200B;

Specs I'm looking for/upset about:

Phone size: I'm a small person, I don't want a phone that is a tablet. I can't even reach the whole screen on the Galaxy S7 active (5.8""), but it's barely so it's livable. 

O2 Monitor: I have health issues that makes having this a huge thing in my phone. Yes, I could always buy a pulse ox, but I can't carry it everywhere like my phone.

Durability/Water proof: I don't think I should spend $800 on something and then need to spend more to put a case on it to prevent it from breaking. Furthermore, I'm clumsy AF and this phone is the only one I've ever had for more than a year (even with the best cases) and I don't even need a case for this one.

Battery Life: Check the actual battery capacity and battery tests, the Samsung Galaxy S7 is not matched by anything I can find. Again, important as I travel and need my phone. Yes, I still use an external battery but I need a phone that I don't have to recharge 3x a day.

All other specs: Camera, GSM band, processor and ram shouldn't be lower than the specs in the Galaxy S7.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I being too picky? I don't think it's ridiculous to except phone companies to make better phones as time goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR- All other phones suck except Samsung Galaxy S7, but I need a new phone.",samsung,2019-07-03 08:39:30

It's really not hard for me to drop weight (it's ok... you can hate me if you want) so I need to keep my calories at a consistent level. I really don't need it to drop anymore than it already has lol. So I put in my new weight with my goal weight and now it's telling me to consume even LESS calories than when I was heavier? Like wth? Shouldn't that be the opposite? It tells me to eat 2042 if I want to gain 2lbs a week which is lower than MFP's 2140 for .5lbs a week. So I'm confused...

10 years, initially chose it because it could do way more than a regular smartphone but god knows times have changed. Samsung Pay availability, Power Share and the wide angle camera bought me over. Now if I sell it I can get either the S10 even or the S10E and keep around 200 bucks.

Trying both in-store, I'm liking the S10E because it's oh so slightly smaller than the XS but with the same screen size and smaller bezels, but I dont know if an S10E would be a better sidegrade.

Always hated Face ID on iPhone, huge headache on 60% of situations, so I'd be using the fingerprint reader most of the time, so that's an extra point for the lightning fast response on the S10E.

As the title says, I am an Apple guy and I have been for some time. I have never used a Samsung product, but I am seriously considering it.

I currently have the older model of the iPad Pro 10.5, but I am looking to buy a new machine for my daily work. I am a school principal and I originally purchased the iPad Pro because I thought I could replace my laptop with it and take it to meetings, classroom observations, do reports etc. However, I quickly learned that it does not multi-task well, which is why I am looking for a new machine (I did use the iPad for about a year). 

Before I purchase a full laptop, I thought I would take a look at other brand tablets and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S5E caught my eye. So, I was hoping you could answer some of my questions as I can't seem to find them online or in the YouTube videos I have watched:

1. Can you install Microsoft Office apps? If so, are they full apps? Something I like about the iPad Pro is that the Office apps work very well. I am a doctoral student and all of my work has to be submitted in DOC formats. Can you view multiple Word documents at a time?
2. My school uses Google apps for everything. On the iPad Pro, I can install the apps, but I can only view one Google Doc at a time. You cannot even use a web browser to view a Google Doc; you have to use the actual app. This is a serious hindrance to me because I often have to be able to look at multiple Google Docs. Can I view multiple Google Docs on the S5E? I was wondering if DeX mode allows this.
3. I use Google Sites for our school's website. However, the new Google Sites is not available on the iPad (either through app or through a web browser).
4. Any additional feedback you have would be helpful (especially if you have experience using this as a college student or business professional).

Thank you in advance for your help.",samsung,2019-07-05 11:01:25

 Now onto the problem; my power button is stuck and doesnt work. I am forced to use an app off of the play store instead to replace the function of it until I get an answer. Any help would be appreciated!

 And a bonus question if you are willing to answer it: When I restart my phone (during the startup,) it says that installing a custom OS is dangerous.

I understand that budget phones will have lower specs than mainstream phones, my confusion comes when I look at the Galaxy A10 which is £139.95 at Argos (UK), while the Galaxy J3 cost £149.95 despite the clearance sale the J3 is under. This is confusing to me because the A10 has a superior Android version than the J3, and double its storage capacity yet somehow it's cheaper than the Galaxy J3? Why is the A10 cheaper than the J3 despite being superior in specifications?  


The reason it's important for me to ask is because I've often found that buying budget phones has not been for me, as in they're prone to breaking a lot and my Galaxy S3 mini that I brought in 2013 had a lot of software issue that the phone provider couldn't fix so that's why I'm being cautious and want to make sure I'm getting the best bang for buck.",samsung,2019-07-05 20:58:34

&amp;#x200B;

I got a Samsung Galaxy A8 2018, and it makes a strange sound as audible in the attached video.

&amp;#x200B;

This is really annoying but I have not yet found how to disable it. The sound is played when updating apps - which is the most annoying situation, cause with 20 apps to be updated, the sound plays 20 times over like half a hour - but I have also heard it in other situations like when the phone ist idle on my desk.

&amp;#x200B;

I already disabled all notifications I could think of, and yes - none show up, no regular notification appear. 

I also have my phone on silent mode.

&amp;#x200B;

c9ueii,"This phone is just great. It is small, thin, light and easy to hold with one hand. No notch or cutout and its got all the stuff like headphone jack, micro SD etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have the Note 9 and I don't like it that much. It is big, thicker, heavier and it's more like a tablet than a phone. The only time I ever use it now is when I do / go somewhere where I need to take notes. Aside from that, the s8 is way more pleasant to handle.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention that the s8, the original s8 - the small one has smoother scrolling than all the other samsung phones I've tested. I've tested the s8 plus, s9 plus and Note 9 (haven't tested the small s9 model though). With all the other ones, even though they load webpages and apps faster, and are overall faster, when you're scrolling up and down, not only is it too fast, but also with many webpages and apps there is jumping up and down of some of the boxes while things are being loaded. The s8 barely ever does any of this in the sense that even if everything is being loaded up as I'm scrolling, nothing will jump even slightly when it loads, meaning that all the key things are loaded first with their exact dimensions after they load. And the scrolling speed is also slower for the sake of smoothness and more practicality. (in the sense that when you're scrolling up down, most of the times you want to be reading what's on the screen while you're scrolling and you want to do it slowly. All these plus phones and notes have very sensitive acceleration which is awful).

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, i don't know why they keep making all these newer phones 6.5 inches (no just samsung phones). Even with no bezzels, the width of a 6.5 inch screen is too much, even with a 18 and 19 by 9 ration, the width is still too much for the phone to be comfortable to hold. As of right now, I would only accept a phone SLIGHTLY wider than the s8 and not much taller AND ESPECIALLY not thicker or heavier. The small s10 meets these requirements but it has a notch. That notch it has doubles and triples the size of the status bar, which means you are basically getting a big thick bezel on top, which can only be used when watching videos, but then you have a hole covering part of the video. So, with the s10, despite of its slightly bigger screen, you're not getting more screen real estate than the s8 for all apps and non video-related stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, just FYI, I don't hate my Note 9. I absolutely love the convenience of taking notes and I would absolutely reccomend the plus size phones and notes to people who need the s-pen and especially those who don't have a tablet, or maybe even a laptop. Me personally, I have multiple desktop, multiple laptops, multiple tablets, tvs etc., so to me a phone is something that usually sits at my desk and I pick it up every once in a while to quickly check some notifications, make a call, send a message and put it down. Then I put it back on the tablet and usually, most of this is done with 1 hand - something you can't comfortable do with a plus size or note phone, even with the one handed mode enabled. I also use the s8 while in bed and it is perfectly comfortable, just like the note and plus phones. Anything that's not too big (for example a 10 inch tablet) that you can get a firm comfortable grip on is good in bed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But yea, the S8, at least in my situation is still the best phone. (NOT THE PLUS, but the standard s8). The only thing worth upgrading to would be something just slightly bigger than my s8, same thickness or less, and for the front camera to be motorized, resulting in 100% display. And of course all the other things like headphone jack, wireless charging and micro SD. Without something like this, I dont think anything is worth upgrading to for now though. I also really dont like the news I've heard about the Note 10 - front camera as a cutout, instead of it being in the s-pen, no headphone jack and no micro sd. This is pretty much unacceptable.

ca4ya8,"I have owned the galaxy buds for 2 months and i can say im very impressed!

Build-

In my personal opinion i think that the galaxy buds do have a nicer look than the apple airpods, the only problem is that the airpods have been so widely accepted that they look better to people than the less seen galaxy buds. I opted for the black version and think they are the best.

Comfort- 

Galaxy buds with the right size eartip and wingtip feel amazing, they have amazing isolation and have never fallen out of my ears even in rigourous exercise. The airpods cannot change eartips, they are all the same size. For some people thay fit their ears perfectly and they cam barely feel them being there, for the people whose ears the airpods dont fit will have alot of difficulty keeping the airpods in their ears as they tend to slip out.

Case-

The case design is pretty cool indeed, i like the design better than the airpod case. The galacy buds casr also comes with wireless charging at no extra cost, with the airpods you will have to get a different airpod case costing more for wireless charging.

One big setback is that with the case you only have 7 hours extra charge (13 hours total including the buds themselves which have a decent 6 hours charge) this is compared to the airpod case which holds something like 20 hours extra charge. The galaxy buds case is definatly harder to open with one hand.

Sound quality (music)

Out of the box the galaxy buds sounded fairly good but as soon as i went into the wearable app and turned the eq to dynamic i was extremely happy with the sound quality, the bass is very good (even better when the bass boost eq is on)
The buds hold strong in every genre and always produce good crisp music. They are very loud, but first you have to go into the app and set the touch controlls to volume up/down and set it to max ( the buds have a seperate volume to the phone) 

The airpods at first i thought sounded alright for a truely wireless set of earphones, this was soon changed when i listned to the sound quality of other wireless earphones. The airpods do have loud bass but it is not fully punchy as the airpid isolation is terrible. With listening to music in other genres sometimes i found that the instruments can get lost in the vocals.

Sound quality videos/movies-

I like many other people love to watch netflix and youtube, with the buds i can promise you that the sound will be be crisp and clear. The isolation is amazing and you can really get into the movie with no interuptions from the outside. The galaxy buds have no latency whatsover with my samsung phone (havent tested them with other phone brands)

The airpods meanwhile were never isolated enough for me to enjoy the majority of youtube/netflix, this is of course only if you are in a place with alot of outside ambient noise listening with them in a quiet environment will be much more acceptable. They also dont have any latency aswell which is a plus for them.

Sound quality (calls)

The buds call quality in quiet environments is always good, this can not be the same fro noisey environments where they tend to lose alot of their quality. I will have to give the better call quality to the airpods as they always sound clear due to the positioning of their mic.

Price-

I bought my galaxy buds for AU 250$ compared to the airpods (gen 2 with wireless case) coming in at AU 300$. I think that 250$ au is a good price and is affordable for most people.

Verdict-

The galaxy buds are definatley worth a look, they are awesome in every way, i think that they are better than airpods in all areas except for the case battery and call quality.",samsung,2019-07-07 17:13:53

So 3 days ago I decided to try the built-in screen recording on galaxy s9+ (Built-in screen recording is found in devices that have game tools software, which can be found in the navigation bar when a game or a supported app is currently in use). I set the recording settings to 1080p recording internal sound without using mic.

After recording it and watching it, I noticed that the recording is going around 25-30 fps, while the game while it was recording was going on 60 fps. I tried doing it on 760p, and it recorded it at 60 fps with no problems. Meaning that 1080p has an issue and does not record at the amount of fps I was experiencing in the game.

So I was wondering if this was indeed a bug on this version of game tools or if it is only my phone that has this issue.. because it seems like samsung doesn't know anything else other than ""factory reset your phone"".

Please tell me that it is a bug in game tools so I can relief myself and not send my phone for 2 weeks to samsung just for them to say that they fixed it without actually doing anything to it.

calo0q,"I've had a Samsung phone for the ever since the s3 (Galaxy s3 not gear S3 although I do have the watch). I'm just so tired of getting excited about an update that is announced and having to wait months and months for that update to come around to me. Me having Samsungs newest flagship s10 plus I feel like I should be getting updates within a week of their release like Google and Apple (hurts to say). With that being said, I still haven't gotten the March update that's supposed to massively improve the fingerprint sensor. Believe me I have been refreshing that find updates button day after day. Still. Nothing. I just feel like Samsung needs to implement updates in a new way like through their Samsung members app or the Samsung store. I'm sure a lot of you feel this way and it definitely doesn't help that I am in the U.S and on a carrier-locked phone so I get my updates on the absolute butt end. This has gotten me wanting a pixel as my next phone despite all the great qualities of Samsung phones. That is all. Have a good day everyone.",samsung,2019-07-08 22:23:27

cay2ym,"Hey everyone,

I hope this is the right place to post this. I'm on the market for an activity tracker (mainly to track my heart rate when I'm active, and my sleep schedule), and after looking at the Mi Band 4, I stumbled upon the newly released Samsung Galaxy Fit and Fit e.

I'm pretty active, doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu 3 times a week and running 2 times a week. I've been logging all my activities in Strava, and while it's been great for running, martial arts get the short straw as data is not really well displayed (there's no Martial Arts category in Strava, so I log my sessions as ""Workouts"" and it counts as ""cross-training"").

I've tried Endomondo which seem to be more what I'm looking for, but it seems hard to find an activity tracker that's compatible with that app.

So I'm trying out Samsung Health, which looks to be really complete, apart from a few quirks that irk me a bit.

1. It seems there's no web view for Samsung Health? I've been looking and it looks like everything is contained in the app, am I missing something?
2. Samsung Health seems **really** closed. I've been trying to send my data from Strava to Samsung Health, and so far no luck. Same goes from SH to Strava: I've found a ""sync"" option but it does not work?
3. There is no ""overview"" of my general activities? So far the only thing I've found that resemble an overview is when I go to ""record"" an activity and go to the ""trend"" tab. But it only lists sessions for this specific activity. There's no calendar view of **all** my activities somewhere? When I click on ""activity"" it just shows the last 30 days. So after that everything is lost?
4. Is it possible to sync Samsung Health with another app such as Endomondo or Google Fit?

This might be outside of the scope of this subreddit, but maybe I could content myself with a wrist HRM that can be linked with Strava/Endomondo? Does such a thing exist? I even considered going the Garmin route, but their software Garmin Connect does not have a ""Martial arts"" section either.",samsung,2019-07-09 16:28:02

Ok so a few days ago I broke the screen on my note 8. Older phone so it had its share of issues, but it was my phone and I loved it. Good news is I had full replacement, so for a $30 deductible I get a new screen at a local vendor (even better). They get the new screen in, looks beautiful. They need me to come by and put in my code to run some diagnostics. This is where the real trouble starts. The Samsung diagnostics software runs and fails a couple tests. NBD, I'm not concerned about telephoto auto focus on my 2 year old phone, the pics actually still look great. But no no I don't understand. See, unless it passes the tests 100%, they have to put the *old broken screen* back on my phone and send it to Samsung for a full replacement. Oh, and my deductable goes up to $199. Not what I want to hear. I'm holding what I consider to be a perfectly acceptable solution in my hand. So I say, what if I pay out of pocket to replace the camera module. That's only $120 and hey, it fixes the camera too. So they keep the phone over night, at least I'm able to back things up using smart switch and today they put in the camera. I come back to unlock the phone again and the diagnostics still show the camera as failed, but now too so is the magnetic sensor and maybe something else. They call Samsung and whisper shibboleth into the phone to get real tech support, diagnosis main board needs to be replaced. Can't close out the ticket so they get paid the rest of the insurance money, so they need to put the *old broken screen* back on and send it in. This cannot be real. I am willing to sign any thing that absolves then of future issues and voids all hell out of my warrantee, but they still cannot release with the fixed screen.

&amp;#x200B;

Just got the S10e and was trying to sync the agenda app (That u cannot \*\*\*\* remove anymore) with my work Outlook and my private Gmail.

&amp;#x200B;

However, i cannot even pick outlook? Its just Gmail, Google or Samsung.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any way to use the agenda app for Outlook? 

If not, is there a way to remove it without harming warranty?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks.",samsung,2019-07-11 15:52:29

Then the power switch on the television snapped off. Here's a pic: https://i.imgur.com/uZ6BMG1.jpg

Sadly, it can only be turned off now with the remote. And having kids, the remote gets lost frequently.

So I called Costco. They sad it was physical damage. I talked to Samsung. It was going to cost me to have them repair it, which was frustrating to me. In the end, I just ordered an extra remote for when the regular remote is hard to find because of my kids. Or at least I always blame it on one of my kids.

I'm extremely disappointed. To me, it feels like it was faulty design or faulty manufacturing. It broke from normal use of turning it off and on with the switch on the bottom of the television that couldn't even be hit by anything.

Anyway, I just thought I would share here. I have always loved my Samsung products. My experience with my last three Samsung phones have been great. That's why I bought one of their televisions, but this really has me discouraged with them.",samsung,2019-07-12 04:43:30

I'm in Australia and my phone seems to have blown up.
I was in a shopping centre and noticed my balls sweating ( its winter) which I thought was strange, I grabbed my phone out and noticed it was roasting hot like I'm talking too hot to touch.
I removed the case and put it in my jacket pocket hoping it would cool down (thought I was leaning in some button or something) 
When I got into Coles 10 min later I noticed my watch tell me my phone had disconnected, I pulled it out and smelt of oil and chemicals and it was dead black and unresponsive. 
then I remembered when I was driving to the shops there was a burning smell but I didn't think much and it was like an hour before this all happened so who knows.

I have followed a ""what to do when your phone won't turn on "" thing but no luck, I can't get it into any reset or any mode it's just completely dead, it had 100% battery also.

cc852m,"Hello guys! After leaving my Galaxy J5 2017 in November of last year to get a Nokia 7 plus and having it stolen around one week ago, I had to come back to that J5 temporarily with plans of getting another phone. I was really impressed with it (and I was ""crying"" over coming back to Samsung a few momths after I got that 7+ anyway), and henceforth I am planning on getting a Samsung phone again, also given that I have the Galaxy Buds and a Gear S3. I settled on the S10 or S10e (my dad has a S10+ taken with a pre-order, which is also the source for my Buds) because of my hefty demands with a phone

TL;DR  I think the S10e is kinda more suited for me, because of the flat screen and the compact design (I've tested it, not the S10, I'll test it in an hour), but I am concerned about the overall performance, the cameras, and that in-display fingerprint sensor of the S10 seems cool

These my criteria of selecting a phone:
- high performance. I play pubg, not expecting ultra-high graphics, but I want it to run smoothly. Also I am quite a heavy user (lots of Music via Bluetooth and YouTube, also the pubg). I don't think it's an issue with any of those two...right?
- battery life to be good to great. I expect charghing it only during night, but something more than this is obviously welcome
- I like the flat screen on the S10e. However, is the curved display that bad on the S10?
- I want an ultra-wide camera, but heard the S10e has that too, the telephoto being the one missing?
- not that big of a phone. The S10+ is just as big as the 7+ so the normal one should be smaller. I've seen the e, it's very compact and I might see it a bit to small, but I kind of think the normal one would be a more balanced option
 - preferably a dedicated MicroSD slot, but I think none of them has that
- stereo speakers (those are a must)
- they both come with a plastic screen preotectorz right?

Sidenote, pricing is not taken into consideration here. So, what phone do you think I should get?",samsung,2019-07-12 16:25:32

Yesterday, I decided to update my phone since it had been asking me to update for a while but I always delayed it. The update failed twice so I left it at that and everything was still working fine for a few hours.

&amp;#x200B;

I then had the phone totally freeze on me for a good 10 minutes. After a quick search online, I found the reset tricks (Holding volume down + power to reset etc.) and this worked perfectly. Now though, it seems to have totally bricked.

&amp;#x200B;

Was using my phone before bed, locked it and put it down on my stand and tried to sleep. Maybe 15 minutes later, I looked up to check the time and noticed the screen was black and couldn't see the clock on my lock screen, so tried to unlock it. Nothing. Just a black screen, totally unresponsive to any key presses or reset tricks, no vibration, no blue light of any kind, unresponsive to the charger being plugged in and my computer doesn't recognise it anymore, it's practically turned into a paper weight.

c7lmun,"First off, I'm pretty tech savvy, but I just can't seem to fix this problem. At first I had my tv connected via HDMI Arc to my Vizio 5.1 sound bar, and NO MATTER WHAT tv audio setting I had it in, it would constantly cut of audio for a second or so every 1 - 5 minutes.. it was insanely frustrating. It especially would cut off when I had it on Dolby Digital.. the ONLY settings that it would cut off less on was when I had both audio settings on my tv set to PCM, but then the audio was kind of blurry, as in it was harder to really make out what words where being spoken. And yes, I've done ALL the factory resets on the sound bar already. I even purchased a new HDMI cable and the same thing happened. My tv is new also. I then tried my Xbox 360's Netflix app, and same thing happened. SO, I switched over to optical and again audio skipping on Dolby digital output on my tv just.. less skipping than on HDMI Arc. SO I bought a new optical cable, and the same thing happened. So, now.. last resort, I switch my audio settings to PCM and PCM and somehow that almost fully worked.. now instead of second long skipping every 1 - 5 minutes, it's about one time every hour or so. Better, but no. I want NO skipping, ever. I am not willing to settle, considering the amount I paid for this sound bar. This entire time I was testing it with the built in Samsung Netflix app, which I heard was glitchy with sound bars... so... could THAT be it? After finding that out online, I went to Netflix in my Xbox 360 which is connected via HMDI (not Arc) to my tv, So the Xbox 360's audio is now going to my tv, and from my tv to the sound bar via Optical. You know whats been confusing me forever? My Samsung tv has TWO audio settings... almost everybody has just one from what I've seen online.. HDMI Input Audio Format, the options are: PCM and Bitstream and I also have Digital Output Audio Format, the options are: PCM, Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital+ (Which my sound bar doesn't accept) DTS (Which never seems to be selectable, it's just greyed out), and DTS Neo 2:5 (Which is always selectable, but I hate how it sounds, so I've avoided that one... I haven't tried it on optical yet though, just HDMI Arc.) I need to be clearly explained what are the differences and purposes between the HDMI Input Audio Format and the Digital Output Audio Format.. What do they both individually do, and in HDMI Input Audio Format what is the difference between Bitstream and PCM? What do they both do? ....OK so I set the HDMI Input Audio Format to Bitstream and the Digital Output Audio Format to PCM. and the Xbox 360's audio settings are: Digital Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby Digital with WMA Pro ...and I set it to Dolby Digital 5.1 and it actually didn't skip... BUT  after an hour of everything going good, I was watching Avengers Endgame and an anime with the Netflix setting set to English (5.1) and it didn't skip for a second.. but the volume instead, lowered itself for a second. Which is why I said it ""dimmed"" in the title.. which is... weird.. and still unacceptable. Again, I want it to work perfectly. But.. I do actually LOVE the way PCM on Digital Output Audio Format sounds via Optical.. It's so raw and clear and doesn't sound so ""edited"". It feels like I'm in a theater listening to the sound the way it was intended to be heard.. it even sounds better to me than dolby digital via HMDI Arc, which makes it sound like I'm listen to the movie through over priced headphones that slightly over ""edit"" the sound slightly instead of leaving the sound the way the sound engineers intended it to be listened to.. but that's just my personal opinion from what I hear.. So I love PCM via optical and am hoping I can keep it, (Though, Ill happily use Dolby Digital if I can get it to work perfectly) but at this point? I just want to find SOME setting that will just work and never skip or dim in audio that allows me to get 5.1 surround sound no matter what. 5.1 surround sound is also very important to me considering I payed extra for a sound bar just to get 5.1 instead of a way cheaper 2.0 sound bar.. so I would like to retain those features if possible, while getting the best sound I can. So NOW, I changed the HDMI Input Audio Format to PCM on my tv.. and am going to watch something else again on Netflix as a test with all the settings the same except for that one change.. Both the HDMI Input Audio Format and the Digital Output Audio Format is set to PCM now via Optical, with the Netflix setting set to English (5.1) I'll update, to see what happens... This has been about 2 or so months of trial and error, I even replaced the first very same sound bar to see is it was just defective or a dud that I had bought from Walmart online, and the second sound bar that was replaced by Vizio using my warranty WAS skipping way less via HDMI Arc.. but it was still skipping.. which is the sound bar I currently have now. I do think the first sound bar was defective though, this one that I have currently seems to have hope... I. just. need. the. right. audio. settings. I'm going insane at this point. lol and I'm going to go even more insane if I have to watch Avengers Infinity War again.. which is the movie I was using to test the sound bars on these last 2 months, because it has the perfect amount of normal volume talking, loud shouting, loud orchestral music, subtle orchestral music, loud explosions, low explosions, subtle sounds, huge battles, normal like every other action movie sounding fight scenes, and basically all the sounds of the average ""movie experience"" all rolled into one movie .. I almost memorized every line.. I've even noticed the CGI mistakes.. the background actors that are smiling when they shouldn't be.. the ADR that sounds out of place.. this sound bar has made me sick of Infinity War.. and I used to love that movie. Great. Thanks Vizio sound bar. lol


OH and to add upon that I also have an android tv box that I have no idea what settings to set it to. I am thinking about buying an Xbox One X and using an HDMI splitter to send all of my HDMI devices through my Xbox One X and then connect my optical cable to the back of the Xbox One X to send all of my audio to my sound bar.. BUT.. I'm ify on that, as I don't want my Xbox One to be on all day long just because I want to watch a device that's connected through it... you know? Also, what audio settings would I need to put on my Xbox One X to make it work perfectly with my sound bar in the future? Just out of curiosity? Oh and my Wii is connected via component cables to the back of my Samsung tv, and it cuts off audio ALOT with optical as well.. about every 1 - 5 minutes, regardless of what audio option I give it.. It only works fine when I convert the wii RCA red and white cables audio to 3.5mm and plug it into the 3.5mm input on my sound bar.. THEN it works and doesn't skip... also no my tv doesn't have a 3.5 mm output or an RCA output for some dumb reason.. I'm stuck with and limited to either HDMI Arc or Optical.. and so far optical seems to be the ONLY ONE that is giving me semi hope here. 


Can someone give me exact settings to set everything to to make this all work? I really don't want to have to rely on an Xbox One.. Also can some explain to me what these settings mean? I HAVE google searched them, but the explanations always seem so vague, and usually the tvs they give explanation examples with never have HDMI input Audio Format... JUST Digital Output Audio Format.. which makes things even more confusing to understand what I'm working with. I have a slight vague idea of everything, but nothing clearly explained to me yet.. I need to know what I'm working with to find a solution. In all, money is really tight right now, and I'm hoping that I don't have to end up returning this and buying something more expensive in the end..

All help I can get is very much appreciated. Thanks to everyone in advance! and sorry for writing so much, but I really had no choice if I wanted to explain everything clearly.

c7pioa,"Background: I have two HDDs that I've had since about 2008, 500 GB and 1 TB in storage size. They have AC adapters and require microUSB cables, making them a hassle to keep track of.  
  
I've almost maxed them out, along with maxing out a 512 GB EVO card that I use for my Android work. I wanted to consolidate everything into a 4 TB+ SSD that I could use for my routine day-to-day organizing and also archive files. I was looking at a Samsung EVO drive to meet these needs.

My friend has been hawking on the value of SSD for the past decade, but only now did I realize he was talking about internal SSD. I've only used external devices, and I still only need them.

Looking on Amazon and similar websites, there doesn't seem to be much market for ""external"" drives, and Google tells me there's no benefit to using SSD over HDD for long term storage. I did see a ""Samsung T5 Portable SSD - 2TB"" but it apparently has its own management software? I'm not looking for that. I'm looking for a dumb drive that I can just throw data on.

Basically, a microSD card but scaled up to 4 TB would be ideal for me, because it doesn't need power or cables. After that would be something big that's USB powered. I like SD cards because when I upgrade, I can reuse the card in a phone, instead of having to get rid of it outright. But SanDisk's A2 SD cards are not supported in any phone right now, and might never be depending on where technology goes in what I expect to be the lifetime for my new drive (10-20 years). 

SanDisk also just released the 1 TB and it's sold out. The SSD from Samsung is only 2 TB, has a management firmware and supposedly has no additional value over an HDD. And the HDD I see available on Amazon (WD 6TB Elements Desktop Hard Drive) I've had fail on me before. It's cheaply made and not reliable.

I would prefer Samsung products since I have an ecosystem of Samsung as well as an account with them. I'm looking for any advice: takes on SSD/HDD for my uses, Samsung vs other OEMs, multiple devices or any other ideas.",samsung,2019-07-01 15:17:44

Samsung UK Support redirected me to Hanaro in the Netherlands. They have the least structured RMA process I have ever experienced, making it very difficult to go through the process, probably hoping the customer gives up.

They had no solution in place for a storage device that has data on it which the customer is unable to delete (I was copying client data from one machine to another, thus GDPR relevant). They verbally assured me they would not look at the data, but I was unable to get that in writing. 

After many messages back and forth, signing several documents, sending multiple images, I got them to agree that I would provide proof of destruction of the USB flash drive, and I did. But I still had to send that to the Netherlands.

Finally, having sent the leftovers of the flash drive (a little bag with shredded bits) to Hanaro in the Netherlands over 10 days ago, they now claim they never received it. I intentionally sent it via normal letter, as any option to send this tracked to the Netherlands would not have been reasonable versus the item's value. Of course, and frankly as expected after this discouraging RMA process, they ""never received it"", ""can I provide proof of delivery?"". Yes, it is possible that they actually have not received it, but frankly it is unlikely. They probably treat most of their non-tracked arrivals like that, conveniently saving money. - 

It's not really about the money / replacement anymore. I thought I quickly have it replaced, but then got sucked into that crazy RMA process, fascinated how bad things could actually be. I hope Samsung UK takes note.

Unfortunately, it looks like I'm not going to be getting a Samsung or anything because no one has made a better phone (for my purposes) since the S7 Active phone. 

Prove me wrong, convert me back, help!

&amp;#x200B;

Specs I'm looking for/upset about:

Phone size: I'm a small person, I don't want a phone that is a tablet. I can't even reach the whole screen on the Galaxy S7 active (5.8""), but it's barely so it's livable. 

O2 Monitor: I have health issues that makes having this a huge thing in my phone. Yes, I could always buy a pulse ox, but I can't carry it everywhere like my phone.

Durability/Water proof: I don't think I should spend $800 on something and then need to spend more to put a case on it to prevent it from breaking. Furthermore, I'm clumsy AF and this phone is the only one I've ever had for more than a year (even with the best cases) and I don't even need a case for this one.

Battery Life: Check the actual battery capacity and battery tests, the Samsung Galaxy S7 is not matched by anything I can find. Again, important as I travel and need my phone. Yes, I still use an external battery but I need a phone that I don't have to recharge 3x a day.

All other specs: Camera, GSM band, processor and ram shouldn't be lower than the specs in the Galaxy S7.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I being too picky? I don't think it's ridiculous to except phone companies to make better phones as time goes on.

10 years, initially chose it because it could do way more than a regular smartphone but god knows times have changed. Samsung Pay availability, Power Share and the wide angle camera bought me over. Now if I sell it I can get either the S10 even or the S10E and keep around 200 bucks.

Trying both in-store, I'm liking the S10E because it's oh so slightly smaller than the XS but with the same screen size and smaller bezels, but I dont know if an S10E would be a better sidegrade.

Always hated Face ID on iPhone, huge headache on 60% of situations, so I'd be using the fingerprint reader most of the time, so that's an extra point for the lightning fast response on the S10E.

c9ay74,"Hello everyone,

As the title says, I am an Apple guy and I have been for some time. I have never used a Samsung product, but I am seriously considering it.

I currently have the older model of the iPad Pro 10.5, but I am looking to buy a new machine for my daily work. I am a school principal and I originally purchased the iPad Pro because I thought I could replace my laptop with it and take it to meetings, classroom observations, do reports etc. However, I quickly learned that it does not multi-task well, which is why I am looking for a new machine (I did use the iPad for about a year). 

Before I purchase a full laptop, I thought I would take a look at other brand tablets and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S5E caught my eye. So, I was hoping you could answer some of my questions as I can't seem to find them online or in the YouTube videos I have watched:

1. Can you install Microsoft Office apps? If so, are they full apps? Something I like about the iPad Pro is that the Office apps work very well. I am a doctoral student and all of my work has to be submitted in DOC formats. Can you view multiple Word documents at a time?
2. My school uses Google apps for everything. On the iPad Pro, I can install the apps, but I can only view one Google Doc at a time. You cannot even use a web browser to view a Google Doc; you have to use the actual app. This is a serious hindrance to me because I often have to be able to look at multiple Google Docs. Can I view multiple Google Docs on the S5E? I was wondering if DeX mode allows this.
3. I use Google Sites for our school's website. However, the new Google Sites is not available on the iPad (either through app or through a web browser).
4. Any additional feedback you have would be helpful (especially if you have experience using this as a college student or business professional).

Thank you in advance for your help.",samsung,2019-07-05 11:01:25
c9baus," Hi r/Samsung, I have a pretty odd problem. ATM I have a smartphone, a very old one, that I am forced to stick with until I grab a new one. It runs on android 4.4.4 (crappy) but does its job. I haven't really had any unfixable problems with it until now. If you need to know what phone it is, it is the Samsung Galaxy Core Prime. Cheap phone but it works. 

 Now onto the problem; my power button is stuck and doesnt work. I am forced to use an app off of the play store instead to replace the function of it until I get an answer. Any help would be appreciated!

 And a bonus question if you are willing to answer it: When I restart my phone (during the startup,) it says that installing a custom OS is dangerous. As far as I know, no custom UIs are on my phone right now aside from an emoji keyboard, which I have temporarily uninstalled to see if it were the reason. And it wasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that budget phones will have lower specs than mainstream phones, my confusion comes when I look at the Galaxy A10 which is £139.95 at Argos (UK), while the Galaxy J3 cost £149.95 despite the clearance sale the J3 is under. This is confusing to me because the A10 has a superior Android version than the J3, and double its storage capacity yet somehow it's cheaper than the Galaxy J3? Why is the A10 cheaper than the J3 despite being superior in specifications?  


The reason it's important for me to ask is because I've often found that buying budget phones has not been for me, as in they're prone to breaking a lot and my Galaxy S3 mini that I brought in 2013 had a lot of software issue that the phone provider couldn't fix so that's why I'm being cautious and want to make sure I'm getting the best bang for buck.",samsung,2019-07-05 20:58:34

I also have the Note 9 and I don't like it that much. It is big, thicker, heavier and it's more like a tablet than a phone. The only time I ever use it now is when I do / go somewhere where I need to take notes. Aside from that, the s8 is way more pleasant to handle.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention that the s8, the original s8 - the small one has smoother scrolling than all the other samsung phones I've tested. I've tested the s8 plus, s9 plus and Note 9 (haven't tested the small s9 model though). With all the other ones, even though they load webpages and apps faster, and are overall faster, when you're scrolling up and down, not only is it too fast, but also with many webpages and apps there is jumping up and down of some of the boxes while things are being loaded. The s8 barely ever does any of this in the sense that even if everything is being loaded up as I'm scrolling, nothing will jump even slightly when it loads, meaning that all the key things are loaded first with their exact dimensions after they load. And the scrolling speed is also slower for the sake of smoothness and more practicality. (in the sense that when you're scrolling up down, most of the times you want to be reading what's on the screen while you're scrolling and you want to do it slowly. All these plus phones and notes have very sensitive acceleration which is awful).

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, i don't know why they keep making all these newer phones 6.5 inches (no just samsung phones). Even with no bezzels, the width of a 6.5 inch screen is too much, even with a 18 and 19 by 9 ration, the width is still too much for the phone to be comfortable to hold. As of right now, I would only accept a phone SLIGHTLY wider than the s8 and not much taller AND ESPECIALLY not thicker or heavier. The small s10 meets these requirements but it has a notch. That notch it has doubles and triples the size of the status bar, which means you are basically getting a big thick bezel on top, which can only be used when watching videos, but then you have a hole covering part of the video. So, with the s10, despite of its slightly bigger screen, you're not getting more screen real estate than the s8 for all apps and non video-related stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, just FYI, I don't hate my Note 9. I absolutely love the convenience of taking notes and I would absolutely reccomend the plus size phones and notes to people who need the s-pen and especially those who don't have a tablet, or maybe even a laptop. Me personally, I have multiple desktop, multiple laptops, multiple tablets, tvs etc., so to me a phone is something that usually sits at my desk and I pick it up every once in a while to quickly check some notifications, make a call, send a message and put it down. Then I put it back on the tablet and usually, most of this is done with 1 hand - something you can't comfortable do with a plus size or note phone, even with the one handed mode enabled. I also use the s8 while in bed and it is perfectly comfortable, just like the note and plus phones. Anything that's not too big (for example a 10 inch tablet) that you can get a firm comfortable grip on is good in bed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But yea, the S8, at least in my situation is still the best phone. (NOT THE PLUS, but the standard s8). The only thing worth upgrading to would be something just slightly bigger than my s8, same thickness or less, and for the front camera to be motorized, resulting in 100% display. And of course all the other things like headphone jack, wireless charging and micro SD. Without something like this, I dont think anything is worth upgrading to for now though. I also really dont like the news I've heard about the Note 10 - front camera as a cutout, instead of it being in the s-pen, no headphone jack and no micro sd. This is pretty much unacceptable. The whole point of a note phone is for it to have EVERYTHING + the pen.",samsung,2019-07-06 22:51:25

So I immediately hit the emergency switch, and put it under my vent upside down with the A/C on. It's the next day. Would it be safe at all if I put it outside and tried letting it run and see if it would operate correctly? I never knew how useful a robot vacuum could be. Especially if you have a Galaxy because it just shows up in your notifications. I ask because I'm wondering if it could be safe since I probably just made the motor really hot to the point that it started smoking. I wouldn't know from automotive.

ca4ya8,"I have owned the galaxy buds for 2 months and i can say im very impressed!

Build-

In my personal opinion i think that the galaxy buds do have a nicer look than the apple airpods, the only problem is that the airpods have been so widely accepted that they look better to people than the less seen galaxy buds. I opted for the black version and think they are the best.

Comfort- 

Galaxy buds with the right size eartip and wingtip feel amazing, they have amazing isolation and have never fallen out of my ears even in rigourous exercise. The airpods cannot change eartips, they are all the same size. For some people thay fit their ears perfectly and they cam barely feel them being there, for the people whose ears the airpods dont fit will have alot of difficulty keeping the airpods in their ears as they tend to slip out.

Case-

The case design is pretty cool indeed, i like the design better than the airpod case. The galacy buds casr also comes with wireless charging at no extra cost, with the airpods you will have to get a different airpod case costing more for wireless charging.

One big setback is that with the case you only have 7 hours extra charge (13 hours total including the buds themselves which have a decent 6 hours charge) this is compared to the airpod case which holds something like 20 hours extra charge. The galaxy buds case is definatly harder to open with one hand.

Sound quality (music)

Out of the box the galaxy buds sounded fairly good but as soon as i went into the wearable app and turned the eq to dynamic i was extremely happy with the sound quality, the bass is very good (even better when the bass boost eq is on)
The buds hold strong in every genre and always produce good crisp music. They are very loud, but first you have to go into the app and set the touch controlls to volume up/down and set it to max ( the buds have a seperate volume to the phone) 

The airpods at first i thought sounded alright for a truely wireless set of earphones, this was soon changed when i listned to the sound quality of other wireless earphones. The airpods do have loud bass but it is not fully punchy as the airpid isolation is terrible. With listening to music in other genres sometimes i found that the instruments can get lost in the vocals.

Sound quality videos/movies-

I like many other people love to watch netflix and youtube, with the buds i can promise you that the sound will be be crisp and clear. The isolation is amazing and you can really get into the movie with no interuptions from the outside. The galaxy buds have no latency whatsover with my samsung phone (havent tested them with other phone brands)

The airpods meanwhile were never isolated enough for me to enjoy the majority of youtube/netflix, this is of course only if you are in a place with alot of outside ambient noise listening with them in a quiet environment will be much more acceptable. They also dont have any latency aswell which is a plus for them.

Sound quality (calls)

The buds call quality in quiet environments is always good, this can not be the same fro noisey environments where they tend to lose alot of their quality. I will have to give the better call quality to the airpods as they always sound clear due to the positioning of their mic.

Price-

I bought my galaxy buds for AU 250$ compared to the airpods (gen 2 with wireless case) coming in at AU 300$. I think that 250$ au is a good price and is affordable for most people.

Verdict-

The galaxy buds are definatley worth a look, they are awesome in every way, i think that they are better than airpods in all areas except for the case battery and call quality.",samsung,2019-07-07 17:13:53

So 3 days ago I decided to try the built-in screen recording on galaxy s9+ (Built-in screen recording is found in devices that have game tools software, which can be found in the navigation bar when a game or a supported app is currently in use). I set the recording settings to 1080p recording internal sound without using mic.

After recording it and watching it, I noticed that the recording is going around 25-30 fps, while the game while it was recording was going on 60 fps. I tried doing it on 760p, and it recorded it at 60 fps with no problems. Meaning that 1080p has an issue and does not record at the amount of fps I was experiencing in the game.

So I was wondering if this was indeed a bug on this version of game tools or if it is only my phone that has this issue.. because it seems like samsung doesn't know anything else other than ""factory reset your phone"".

Please tell me that it is a bug in game tools so I can relief myself and not send my phone for 2 weeks to samsung just for them to say that they fixed it without actually doing anything to it.

I know the S10 and S10+ come with a pre installed a screen protector but I don't know about the S10e. The guy at best buy (canada) told me the S10e does come with a pre installed screen but I don't believe him since I can't removed the so pre installed screen.,samsung,2019-07-09 11:14:42

cay2ym,"Hey everyone,

I hope this is the right place to post this. I'm on the market for an activity tracker (mainly to track my heart rate when I'm active, and my sleep schedule), and after looking at the Mi Band 4, I stumbled upon the newly released Samsung Galaxy Fit and Fit e.

I'm pretty active, doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu 3 times a week and running 2 times a week. I've been logging all my activities in Strava, and while it's been great for running, martial arts get the short straw as data is not really well displayed (there's no Martial Arts category in Strava, so I log my sessions as ""Workouts"" and it counts as ""cross-training"").

I've tried Endomondo which seem to be more what I'm looking for, but it seems hard to find an activity tracker that's compatible with that app.

So I'm trying out Samsung Health, which looks to be really complete, apart from a few quirks that irk me a bit.

1. It seems there's no web view for Samsung Health? I've been looking and it looks like everything is contained in the app, am I missing something?
2. Samsung Health seems **really** closed. I've been trying to send my data from Strava to Samsung Health, and so far no luck. Same goes from SH to Strava: I've found a ""sync"" option but it does not work?
3. There is no ""overview"" of my general activities? So far the only thing I've found that resemble an overview is when I go to ""record"" an activity and go to the ""trend"" tab. But it only lists sessions for this specific activity. There's no calendar view of **all** my activities somewhere? When I click on ""activity"" it just shows the last 30 days. So after that everything is lost?
4. Is it possible to sync Samsung Health with another app such as Endomondo or Google Fit?

This might be outside of the scope of this subreddit, but maybe I could content myself with a wrist HRM that can be linked with Strava/Endomondo? Does such a thing exist? I even considered going the Garmin route, but their software Garmin Connect does not have a ""Martial arts"" section either.",samsung,2019-07-09 16:28:02

When I'm recording, I have the camera hovering over my desk as I draw. The camera turns off about every 11 minutes. This time, I'm going to be vlogging in the store.

Also, I googled what amount of video time I should have and it says 40 minutes. I've deleted all but 1 of my pictures on one of the cards, and it only added 3 seconds more of record/video time.

I love the note for what it is, but for me, the size and weight are just totally impractical. Has screen replaced 6 months in after an ex gf slammed my phone (don't ask). 6 months later, dropped again in Samsung's ""rugged"" case, screen cracked. Seemingly every subsequent drop resulted in many more cracks, before the whole thing was just shot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Love Samsung One UI (plus Nova) and Samsung pay, so glad they released a phone with a flat screen and a durable plastic layer between the glass and the frame. I want to say the s10e feels like 1/3 of the weight overall, which should help too.

Ok so a few days ago I broke the screen on my note 8. Older phone so it had its share of issues, but it was my phone and I loved it. Good news is I had full replacement, so for a $30 deductible I get a new screen at a local vendor (even better). They get the new screen in, looks beautiful. They need me to come by and put in my code to run some diagnostics. This is where the real trouble starts. The Samsung diagnostics software runs and fails a couple tests. NBD, I'm not concerned about telephoto auto focus on my 2 year old phone, the pics actually still look great. But no no I don't understand. See, unless it passes the tests 100%, they have to put the *old broken screen* back on my phone and send it to Samsung for a full replacement. Oh, and my deductable goes up to $199. Not what I want to hear. I'm holding what I consider to be a perfectly acceptable solution in my hand. So I say, what if I pay out of pocket to replace the camera module. That's only $120 and hey, it fixes the camera too. So they keep the phone over night, at least I'm able to back things up using smart switch and today they put in the camera. I come back to unlock the phone again and the diagnostics still show the camera as failed, but now too so is the magnetic sensor and maybe something else. They call Samsung and whisper shibboleth into the phone to get real tech support, diagnosis main board needs to be replaced. Can't close out the ticket so they get paid the rest of the insurance money, so they need to put the *old broken screen* back on and send it in. This cannot be real. I am willing to sign any thing that absolves then of future issues and voids all hell out of my warrantee, but they still cannot release with the fixed screen.

cbzmgo,"Hey everyone, I'm looking to buy a smartwatch and am deciding between samsung gear sports and galaxy watch active. I can get the gear sports for 140€ while I can get the galaxy active for 180€. I am mostly wondering which one would be the better bang-for-buck. In terms of use, I mainly want to use it to track my running and sleeping. I've heard mixed thoughts abiut the newer model and some disappointment regarding the omitting of the bezel, but this would be my first smartwatch ever, so I am really looking for recommendations from users; so, anyone with experience I would like to ssk you which one is the better value for money?

Thank you in advance and have a good day!",samsung,2019-07-12 02:54:41

I went to google to find if its a bug or something and i wasnt the only one. I took my phone to a store where they downgraded it back to android 8 oreo  and told me not to upgrade it. Now the upgrade notfication keeps coming up again and i want to know. Why is this happening and when will it be fixed? Why is android pie making my screen unresponsive to my touch ?

cc11jv,"So here is the story. I bought this television at Christmas time at Costco. Using my Costco credit card, I even got two extra years of warranty.

Then the power switch on the television snapped off. Here's a pic: https://i.imgur.com/uZ6BMG1.jpg

Sadly, it can only be turned off now with the remote. And having kids, the remote gets lost frequently.

So I called Costco. They sad it was physical damage. I talked to Samsung. It was going to cost me to have them repair it, which was frustrating to me. In the end, I just ordered an extra remote for when the regular remote is hard to find because of my kids. Or at least I always blame it on one of my kids.

I'm extremely disappointed. To me, it feels like it was faulty design or faulty manufacturing. It broke from normal use of turning it off and on with the switch on the bottom of the television that couldn't even be hit by anything.

Anyway, I just thought I would share here. I have always loved my Samsung products. My experience with my last three Samsung phones have been great. That's why I bought one of their televisions, but this really has me discouraged with them.",samsung,2019-07-12 04:43:30

I'm just kinda bummed I have to go back to manually launching Google cam and I have to call out to Google for Assistant or to control my smart home set up at night possibly waking up my kid when it was one click away.

I'm not that crazy for  the yearly updates so it doesn't bother me if I don't get those (though I heard it can get Android 9.0 right?) And I just want a good, reliable phone. How is the battery life?

cc7tsf,"Hey all, 
I'm in Australia and my phone seems to have blown up.
I was in a shopping centre and noticed my balls sweating ( its winter) which I thought was strange, I grabbed my phone out and noticed it was roasting hot like I'm talking too hot to touch.
I removed the case and put it in my jacket pocket hoping it would cool down (thought I was leaning in some button or something) 
When I got into Coles 10 min later I noticed my watch tell me my phone had disconnected, I pulled it out and smelt of oil and chemicals and it was dead black and unresponsive. 
then I remembered when I was driving to the shops there was a burning smell but I didn't think much and it was like an hour before this all happened so who knows.

I have followed a ""what to do when your phone won't turn on "" thing but no luck, I can't get it into any reset or any mode it's just completely dead, it had 100% battery also.

I booked in to see a Samsung store tomorrow hopefully they can save it.

cc852m,"Hello guys! After leaving my Galaxy J5 2017 in November of last year to get a Nokia 7 plus and having it stolen around one week ago, I had to come back to that J5 temporarily with plans of getting another phone. I was really impressed with it (and I was ""crying"" over coming back to Samsung a few momths after I got that 7+ anyway), and henceforth I am planning on getting a Samsung phone again, also given that I have the Galaxy Buds and a Gear S3. I settled on the S10 or S10e (my dad has a S10+ taken with a pre-order, which is also the source for my Buds) because of my hefty demands with a phone

TL;DR  I think the S10e is kinda more suited for me, because of the flat screen and the compact design (I've tested it, not the S10, I'll test it in an hour), but I am concerned about the overall performance, the cameras, and that in-display fingerprint sensor of the S10 seems cool

These my criteria of selecting a phone:
- high performance. I play pubg, not expecting ultra-high graphics, but I want it to run smoothly. Also I am quite a heavy user (lots of Music via Bluetooth and YouTube, also the pubg). I don't think it's an issue with any of those two...right?
- battery life to be good to great. I expect charghing it only during night, but something more than this is obviously welcome
- I like the flat screen on the S10e. However, is the curved display that bad on the S10?
- I want an ultra-wide camera, but heard the S10e has that too, the telephoto being the one missing?
- not that big of a phone. The S10+ is just as big as the 7+ so the normal one should be smaller. I've seen the e, it's very compact and I might see it a bit to small, but I kind of think the normal one would be a more balanced option
 - preferably a dedicated MicroSD slot, but I think none of them has that
- stereo speakers (those are a must)
- they both come with a plastic screen preotectorz right?

Sidenote, pricing is not taken into consideration here. So, what phone do you think I should get?",samsung,2019-07-12 16:25:32

cc87gh,"Hi!

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I decided to update my phone since it had been asking me to update for a while but I always delayed it. The update failed twice so I left it at that and everything was still working fine for a few hours.

&amp;#x200B;

I then had the phone totally freeze on me for a good 10 minutes. After a quick search online, I found the reset tricks (Holding volume down + power to reset etc.) and this worked perfectly. Now though, it seems to have totally bricked.

&amp;#x200B;

Was using my phone before bed, locked it and put it down on my stand and tried to sleep. Maybe 15 minutes later, I looked up to check the time and noticed the screen was black and couldn't see the clock on my lock screen, so tried to unlock it. Nothing. Just a black screen, totally unresponsive to any key presses or reset tricks, no vibration, no blue light of any kind, unresponsive to the charger being plugged in and my computer doesn't recognise it anymore, it's practically turned into a paper weight.

&amp;#x200B;

Any idea's/suggestions what it might be or if it's even fixable?",samsung,2019-07-12 16:34:41

b7qwc9,"I'm really hoping someone here can shed a light on this for me. 

About 3 weeks ago I upgraded TV's and bought a 55inch Smart TV (UN55NU7100FXZA), and everything was great, was streaming UHD on Netflix, everything was playing in 4K smoothly on Youtube, the whole 9. So then I was away from home for about 2 weeks, and then when I come back yesterday... I can hardly stream 1080p without buffering every 30 seconds. Wtf?

For context, my internet speeds float at around 150 down/25 up with a single digit ping. This is current, I can get these results on any device in my house in any room on the same connection, and I assumed the Smart TV shared the same results until recently. Right now I can't test higher than 23 down/ 7 up with a ping anywhere from 130-270 on my TV. 

Yesterday I got on the online support with Samsung and the fella factory restored my TV's settings, checked for all the updates, and changed the DNS to 8.8.8.8, seemed to work for a little while but then today it's the same thing, can't even stream at a shitty 1080p. So it's obviously not my internet considering I can stream the highest possible resolution on any other device in my house, so what gives?! Everything was going good with the TV until just recently and I have no idea what it could be. This is honestly so frustrating taking into account what the TV is supposed to do, my internet connection, and that it wasn't doing this when I bought it. 

Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions? There's clearly something wrong that neither Samsung support nor I can figure out so I'm really hoping someone does. I'm this close to returning the thing if it honestly can't even stream 1080p. Thanks.",samsung,2019-03-31 18:26:13

I was waiting for the Pie update for my Samsung S8 for a while, after last years Facebook and Google privacy shitstorm earlier last year I was hoping they Google and Samsung where going to go in a more Privacy friendly path like Apple has done.

Disappointed to say that Android 9 does not have any privacy settings that where not already available on Android 8.

Because of the privacy problems with Android, I had already made the decision to move to IOS, was hoping that Google Android was going to at least try to fix some of the privacy issues with their OS, but they haven't, this is very disappointing, I have only had Samsung Phones and Tablets since the first Samsung S phone, have had almost every other Samsung S series phone until my current S8, but does not look like Android is changing their anti-piracy ways.

It’s with great sadness and sorrow that we announce Samsung Mobile has been acquired by Apple. 

*After the failure of Samsung’s latest flagship, the S10, and due to the high production costs and low demand for the Galaxy Fold, the company has lost its high share value, causing Apple Inc to buy those shares and effectively take over the Samsung Mobile devision by force.*

We have reflected the new *announcement* by updating our banner to represent the future of Samsung. We believe in the future, and we truly believe Apple will bring a lot to the table.

Please keep all discussion about this dramatic happening here.

b7x68v,"I'm looking to buy one of those but there seem to be so many variants from different years and I'm a little overwhelmed. I have zero experience with Samsung notebooks and haven't found a comparison review or tutorial. Any website you guys could point me to, or any suggestions at all for another 2-in-one device, for that matter? I like Samsung for their Galaxy Notes and their TVs so that was my first thought when I decided to get a 2-in-1 laptop/tablet, but I'm not exactly interested in limiting my options. I just want one that's a ""laptop first"", i.e. one that has the computing power one would expect from a good laptop as opposed to a tablet with a physical keyboard.

As for specs, 16GB RAM would be nice but I guess 8GB could do if there are no good options. 512GB or 1TB SSD is always nice to have, but frankly I store almost everything on the cloud nowadays so I could probably live with a 256GB SSD. I'm not really willing to go with less than 15"" though, so that might help narrow down the pool a bit. Now the processors always lose me — they're all i7 but there are still so many of them, and I'm not very familiar with how much a difference in clock interferes in the subjective perception of performance and lags. I mean I'm not going to crunch benchmarking numbers, know what I mean? As long as it feels fast, responsive and lasting (i.e. keeps up with other high-end laptops for a few years), I'm good.

I do some programming and 3D rendering sometimes, and also the occasional video editing in Premiere once in a blue moon. I'm not really a PC gamer but there's always a first time if the machine supports it. Photoshop, Illustrator and dozens of open Chrome tabs including YouTube and Netflix are more characteristic of my typical day. So between the Notebook 9 Pro and Notebook 9 Pen considering all their variants, which one would you recommend? Or any other at all?",samsung,2019-04-01 04:13:52

b80ezi,"Since I got my S10 Plus I've been thinking of getting the Galaxy Buds but looking at reviews, some positive, some negative and coming from wearing an over ear pair of AKG -K550's (also amazing) at work all day I didn't expect much sound wise and merely wanted the wireless capability. I was ready to take the hit to sound quality for the freedom but my god... these things sound amazing. 

After some playing around with the wingtips and ear bud tips to find the best fitting and seal I pressed play on 'Deutschland' and was blown away with how clear it was on the default setting. Good bass without needing the bass boost. The other settings... not so good but that 'Dynamic' setting works beautifully. Find the right combo of wing and tip and boom.

Setting the long press to Google Assistant also lets me perform actions on the phone or call without needing to take my phone out.

Overall, super impressed and glad I didnt put the purchase off even longer. For anyone on the fence... get off it.

b89cym," I´ve been waiting for Android to catch up on quality apps versus iOS, but it seems is just not going to happen, even as Apple has many issues with iOS, is miles ahead of Android.

&amp;#x200B;

Specially on new flagship android phones like the new Samsung S10+ with gorgeous hardware, superb cameras and video, all of this ruined by poorly optimized apps!  The hardware is so amazing but everything is ruined if the apps you love and use the most behave like crap on the platform!

&amp;#x200B;

The best example is Instagram, on android this apps behaves like a beta version from 2013, many iOS features are not present on the android version, many things don´t work well, is not tuned for the 18:9 (specially for stories) or other aspect ratios but the worst thing of all is the quality of photos, videos and audio for the stories, it´s so bad that is almost unbelievable!

&amp;#x200B;

Why Samsung is not doing everything it can to solve this issue!? Now they worked with instagram for the camera instagram feature, why they can´t work together to fix this? I think we need to force all of Silicon Valley Programmers to forcefully use Android for a month in order to make it better, I really want to like it but there are just way too many issues.

- call quality: very good, but TBH I am not impressed. It's 2019 and it's not quite where it should be. Much better than the X4 but still not as good as landline.

- Wireless is great. I even got 5G (😂). Works pretty well. Faster than the X4. 

- WiFi is solid

- Samsung skin is minimal. Good. Settings confusing a bit

- Display is very good and flat. I would have gotten the S10 if offered with a flat screen.

- battery life is ok. I'm still learning the ropes. 

- physical size: just perfect except for the guy who specified glass back. Slipperier than an eel immersed in WD-40. Spigen case arrives tomorrow

- punchhole is not noticeable. A friend sent a link to hilarious backgrounds that cover the hole, the one with Kim Jong Un is priceless. Google it.

- gaming is exceptional. Angry Birds 2 flies (pun not intended). I'm running at medium power mode CPU at 70%. Not noticeable.

- setup troubles thanks to Android noted in another post. Password party in progress.

- wireless charging rocks. Borrowed a friend's pad to test, OMG. Life changing. Buying one.

b8lj36,"I'm curious if others have had the same or a similar experience to me trying to use their eCertificate.

The whole process of purchasing the S10 and using the promotional $130 eCertificate to purchase the Galaxy Buds has been an unnecessary hassle, and very unprofessionally handled by Samsung. The customer service during this process has been absolutely atrocious.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a list of gripes I have about this whole thing. I'm curious if anyone else picked up on this, and finds this whole thing a bit fishy: 

\- It wasn't clear that you would need to wait weeks after receiving your phone to even get the eCertificate code.

\-There have been conflicting emails from Samsung, and an overall severe lack of communication about the process from start to finish. 

\-Samsung Phone support explained that this was done so the code would be sent right after the return window closed for the phone. I guess I understand this from Samsung's perspective, but that should have been well communicated to each customer.

\- Promotional emails that I received prior to purchasing the S10 state that the following regarding the use of the eCertificate: 

&gt;"" By 4﻿/﻿4﻿/﻿1﻿9, using your Qualifying Purchase device, follow instructions on the Shop Samsung app (""App"") to submit required info. ""

\-It says in the eCertificate email that it expires 06/27/19. I'm not sure which email(s) to believe.

\-The galaxy buds have been out of stock for a while with no way to reserve them or put your name down on a list to receive them once they are available again.

\-The support experience is bad at best. The online chat takes 20 minutes to get in contact with anyone, trying to get someone on the phone results in talking to a robot that just keeps repeating itself, and once you get someone on the phone they advise to continuously check the website to know when the galaxy buds become available (This was later clarified by the customer service representative; where she told me that I could add the product to my wishlist)

\-Emails from Samsung recommend using the eCertificate for the Galaxy  Buds on the Shop Samsung app, however, the product seems to be completely taken off the app.

Then she said, ""What?"" in a confused manner. I replied, ""Nevermind, about a charger. I forgot I could this thing with my phone that can charge other people's phones (Wireless PowerShare)."" As I started up Wireless PowerShare on my S10+, she asked, ""What do I do now?"" And I said, ""Just place your phone on top of mine."" As she placed her iPhone on top of the back of my S10+, I noticed that her phone was at 1% and as her phone vibrated to notify her that her phone was charging; she thought it was so cool. After like 10-15 minutes of charging her phone to 15%, she said thanks and after class she was so amazed that she is now thinking of switching from iPhone to Samsung.

TL;DR: I charged my classmate's iPhone with Wireless PowerShare on my S10+, and she was wowed by the feature that she is now thinking of getting a Samsung.

My thoughts: I think that it is so cool that the Wireless PowerShare function bridges the gap of charging other phones than Samsung that are compatible with Wireless Charging, such as iPhone.

b8s8jt,"Hi guys.

&amp;#x200B;

I figured that i should be transparent with you all regarding events that unfolded yesterday. Transparency with subreddit users is important, to me atleast,  and i feel as though i should let you know what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start from the beginning. 

&amp;#x200B;

I joined this subreddit nearly 2 months ago. My prior moderation experience was.. rather limited to say the least. I was only a moderator (now former) of r/iOSGaming. I was there for approx 3-4 months before i came across r/samsung. What i saw was an abundance of spam, shit posts etc. That i'm sure old users can attest to before the new mod team came a long. I saw that the two top moderators were fairly inactive on the subreddit, but fairly active on other parts of Reddit. So, i decided to give it a shot and message both of them (and create a post) to try see if they needed help. A few days later, i got added to the team.

&amp;#x200B;

When i got added, i immediately started working on rebuilding this subreddit. My first action was to open applications for moderator positions. A few days passed, and i added a couple Moderators to the r/Samsung team. We then started work on rebuilding / expanding the subreddit - **Here is our changelog since the other Moderators and myself were added:**

&amp;#x200B;

# Changelog:

&amp;#x200B;

* We added new Rules.
* A new Banner / icon (Thanks KAS30).
*  Started work on the wiki (Yet to be finished).
*  A proper subreddit description.
*  Added a competent Auto-Mod (This has vastly improved the subreddit overall, reduced spam etc).
*  Added a Tech Support / WSIB thread.
*  Added a Wallpaper Auto-Mod Thread.
* Made a Subreddit Discord.
* Much, Much more behind the scenes stuff

&amp;#x200B;

**I also figured i'd let you know that when i was added, we had a mod queue backed up with 1000 items (Max capacity), and our Modmail was completely and utterly backed up years. Basically, this subreddit hadn't recieved a lot of Mod attention in a** ***very*** **long time.**

&amp;#x200B;

\----

# While we're talking about transparency, Here is the mod log matrix showing each Moderators activity (3/3/2019 was when I got added):

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ff68gdvvfyp21.png

&amp;#x200B;

\----

&amp;#x200B;

# So, What's the point of this post?

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, Myself and other Moderators were talking about the future of the subreddit. We all mutually agreed that this subreddit has really turned around since we all got added. I, personally, brought up that our two top mods hadn't been doing much in Moderating - All the mods agreed. The mod log matrix i showed above can clearly prove my claim. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, before i move on, i'd like to mention that I know moderation isn't easy. We get abused on a daily basis, we get told we're faggots. That we should kill ourselves etc. But we don't let that get to us. What a lot of people seem to forget is Moderation is completely Voluntary, as it should be. Moderation isn't a job we get paid for by Reddit. Stuff can happen in real life (like a death in the family etc) that can also cause activity to go down.**

&amp;#x200B;

So, carrying on, After all the mods mutually agreed that the top mods were inactive i decided to messaged the top mod, Perma. I will give you the full message that i sent him, again, i want to be as transparent as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/5llk8v8ihyp21.png

Now, before you say anything, i know i was rather blunt. But for context, i was being honest, also bear in mind i had **zero** clue Perma and Renegade were the original moderators/creators of the subreddit. It may look bad on my part, but again, i said what myself and the other Moderators agreed on.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, please refer to the mod matrix if you think i'm lying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, after that 3rd message, Perma added 3 new moderators without consulting a single person of the moderation team. All the moderators were confused and really, **really concerned.**

&amp;#x200B;

In the discord i mentioned to Renegade he needs to take over and do the top mod removal procedure ASAP. I, and others said that because we were genuinely concerned something bad was going to happen. It may look hypocritical on my part because **i did** say to Perma, to remove Renegade. However that DM was done before the 3 random mods were invited to moderate. I was concerned so i asked Renegade to start the removal procedure asap because myself and others were concerned that Perma was going to do something really bad.

&amp;#x200B;

A short while after Perma joined the discord server, posted a screenshot of our conversation and stated that it seems i'm a drama causer. He mentioned that it looks like i'm trying to turn Renegade and himself (Perma) against eachother. **Which, admittedly, it does.** After that, Perma removed me as Moderator of the subreddit and as Administrator of the Discord. citing that i cause too much drama.

&amp;#x200B;

Me, him, renegade, and the other mods had a long conversation and he finally agreed to add me back. Which i'm thrilled about. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, /r/samsung reddit mods and r/Samsung discord mods are slowly leaving. Because they can see this situation has been blown way out of proportion, and they don't want to be involved in a subreddit where you can't be honest with one another. Without getting yourself kicked from the subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not surprised if this post gets removed and i get removed as moderator. I'd hope the two top mods would see this as transparency and feel it's a good thing. ***one can only hope.*** **I am not a drama causer, nor am i here to cause subreddit drama. I'm here to help out a community I care about, that is my mission. I'd hope the changes myself and the other mods would prove that.**

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways. Thats all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Transparency report... Done.

b8sltr,"Hi, I got myself the S10+ directly from Samsung's online store and in the past 2 weeks I've been noticing that it reboots at random when I'm not using it. Sometimes its on my desk at work or at home, and I'll notice it just rebooting by itself when I'm not even touching it.

It reboots on average once a day, usually in the afternoon. Sometimes it never reboots or reboots multiple times in a single day.

I was wondering if anyone else is getting this, and if anyone has had this issue in the past with a brand new device. I tried searching for solutions on the internet, but what I have found is mostly posts about the same issue on the Samsung forums with no actual answer from the Samsung support team.

I can live with this problem since I've yet to experience the reboot while I'm actively using the device, but it just annoys me as this is a brand new phone (which I haven't dropped) and I love the rest of my experience with it as of writting this. Its the only flaw I found with it yet.

Now I know the hardware isn't perfect for Windows 10 - but it would run flawlessly for basic task like web browsing, media playback, and uni work / office work.

I would legitimately buy a top of the line S10+ if it had Windows 10 launch on an external display rather than Dex.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know that Microsoft would never go for this partnership because I think it would seriously damage their sales of the surface line / portable devices. But with 12gb of ram, 1tb storage, and a decent enough cpu for Win 10, it would work much better than office for Android.

Samsung had a promotion that if you trade in your S8 (2 models ago), you can get $300 toward any of the new S10’s. As long as it works, no cracks, etc. Versus getting $150 from the “normal” trade in. So I’m like eff it! I’ll order one! May as well get the most for this phone before I really need a new one
 
I followed the instructions to the T on the Samsung app and my order started processing last Thursday. They said they’ll include a return label with the new phone, just do a reset on the old one, throw it in, slap on the new label, send it back within 15 days. No problem.
 
I waited…waited…waited…. Then today I get an email “Your Samsung order has been CANCELLED.”   WTF?!?!?!
 
So I call Samsung and they’re like “Oh your carrier cancelled it. Doesn’t say why. You need to call Verizon. Sorry, son.”
 
I call Verizon…person puts me on hold to look up what happened. Comes back and says “Ok it looks like the phone was sent to some random store like a Best Buy or Sears, they didn’t know what to do with it, so they sent it back to Samsung. You need to call Samsung and let them know.”
 
I call Samsung and tell them. They’re like “Oh how weird. Yeah, we’ve heard of that happening and we don’t know why.”   Uhhh????   “Try ordering it again. Maybe it was just a mistake.”
 
I’m like fine. Let me try it again. I go online, and before I get to the ordering step – THE DAMN PROMOTION IS ALREADY OVER! It’s back to only $150 trade-in value for my phone…
 
I call Samsung again. I’m like look, YOU effed up and now this happened. I want the full $300 trade-in value I would have gotten if you didn’t ship my other phone to some random store. Guy’s all “I can’t do anything. Place the order, then call Samsung and see if they’ll do a price match.”

b94jp7,"I have never minded using both Samsung and Google's services since the system-level apps for Samsung cannot always be uninstalled. I have found many Samsung apps to actually be better than Google's, especially with the OneUI update and some of Google's in a mess, but right now I am reaching a point where it is affecting my contacts and such to a point that I am annoyed.

When I am on my phone, I have multiple ways to contact people on any given app.

On Samsung Messages, if I tap on one person's icon to open the contact info for them, it will open properly. If I tap on a second, it will say ""CONTACT NOT FOUND"" even though they are linked and in my phone\contacts for both Google and Samsung - and I can access it any way. I can even type them in as a person to send a contact.

Then there is the issue that Samsung and Google contacts do not always format phone numbers the exact same, leading to minor issues here and there with area codes, international codes, etc.

Last, I noticed if I go into my Samsung account and look at a contact, it lists a whole 4 or 5 ""LINKED CONTACTS"" with the same information.

I thought that I already merged all my duplicate contacts with my Google contacts long ago? I did not have any issues with this on my Galaxy Note8, even with the version of the OneUI apps I had on there.

Here's what I am getting at:  I am positive I am not missing any setting, but running into the inevitable. Easy contact syncing between phone\email\contacts was possible with Android 8 and my Note8, but updates and overhauls have created a problem where it is messing up again.

**Do I even need to keep my Samsung account active on my phone? Can I uninstall the Contacts and Messages apps by using the ADB force-uninstall command? I am sure it will work but I do not want to break my phone too much**

I'm also tired of having two calendar apps.

I actually like all Samsung's but I need to be able to move in and out seamlessly between computer and phone and right now Samsung isn't providing the integration it had in the previous versions of these apps for me.

Even Maps is a bit too different.

Okay. It was an old phone. So I upgraded to an S8+. Same thing. It was a really good phone for a while. But it started slowing down awfully. Now I have BAD screen burn in with regular use and it can barely hold a charge.

ba2df0,"So I ordered a Q9FN TV from Samsung.com on March 24th. It’s the 2018 model and with the newer model out, I thought I’d be a good opportunity to buy before it goes EOL and they run out. 

At the time, I was able to buy through the site, sign up for financing and picked my delivery date, which was today, April 5th. 

Took the day off work to wait for the scheduled delivery and nothing came. Checked the site, still says delivery date: April 5th. Contacted support and only after getting to a supervisor, they told me the TV is backordered. I had to go through support three times, with each tier 1 rep telling me they don’t know and they’d have to forward my email to another team. 

What pisses me off is that from the time I ordered til now, I was never notified at all. No email telling me there was a change, no notification telling me my shipment will not be coming. Everything pointed to a scheduled delivery date of April 5th. Support told me that they will send my case to their “concern” team, whatever the hell that is. I understand this a 2018 model and it might get sold out. It’s disappointing a company like Samsung’s own e-commerce site lets a customer go through the buy-flow and sign up for financing knowing they don’t have inventory. If I knew it was backordered, I never would have even ordered. I can’t cancel the order because I signed up for Samsung financing. A line of credit that is useless and will be a hit on my credit if I cancel. 

Has anyone else experienced backorder issues with Samsung.com? How did it get resolved? If I cancel the order, or if Samsung ends up canceling the order, what will happen with the Samsung financing? I got an email from them saying my finance info will be coming in the mail  soon (but they couldn’t send me a backorder notification?!). I see a lot of people here having preorder problems with their S10s on here. Samsung needs to get their shit together. ",samsung,2019-04-06 08:39:39
ba367k,"I'm quite annoyed at this point. Samsung phones are bombs. I had an S3 for like, 4-5 years and replaced the battery in it twice. One time the battery expanded so vastly that it cracked the hard shell double layer protective case I had on the phone, and then the back plate **literally** exploded off the back of the phone from pure pressure and bounced off the car windows 4 times before landing in the back seat while my mother was driving and out plopped this ball of a battery 3 times the thickness of the battery its self ready to pop any second. This ball of a battery landed right between my legs, had it exploded I would no longer have been a male.  Luckily, however, it started to deflate on its own, and I happened to be right near a battery shop where I walked in with it, placed it on the counter, the guy dived back as if I placed a bomb on the countertop and I said ""I need a new one of these"" and just popped a new one in and carried on about my day. I had to replace it again a year alter because it also began expanding but I replaced it far sooner that time.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have an S8. Where you GLUE THE BATTERY INSIDE THE PHONE.... For no reason. You just, make your phone deliberately bad. Rounded edges so you can't use a screen protector and can't get a decent case either. You glue the battery inside the case, you glue the case on so it can't be opened up. Is your business plan to design portable airport safe BOMBS? Or is it just to make sure people have to replace their entire phone yearly?

&amp;#x200B;

Don't give me that crap about people wanting ""thinner phones with no edges"".  No one wants that except the people you train to want that by repeating ""everyone wants it, everyone wants it, everyone wants it, everyone wants it"" in their ear every day for years on in till they grow up thinking its true. You can see people going out and buying protective cases for their phones, clearly phone thickness isn't a problem if you're willing to triple the size of your phone to protect it. Clearly, screen edges aren't an issue if you're willing to cling a phone protector on there that adds to the screen's edge.

&amp;#x200B;

Its bad enough your phone is so ridiculously long that it can't fit in my jacket chest pockets now. I was out on a jog and the phone bounced up and out of the pocket and landed on the corner cracking the screen, luckily because I had a phone protector on it, the cracks were very minimal and I just keep using it as is. However had you not had a ROUND screen, it wouldn't have sustained any damage. I would have both, been able to put a screen protector on it, and the screen would never have sustained such a close indirect impact with the cement falling 4 feet. How do I know this? Because I dropped my S3, many MANY times. Even face down on its screen landing on rocks, with its tempered glass screen protector, it didn't even sustain a single scratch. That phone is still alive, and still works even today. I set it up as a kids toy for a friend with kid games and learning apps after I replaced the battery inside a 3rd time. That phone sustained more drops than any new age phone could possibly take. Your new age phones, one drop shatters them. My S3 was dropped a minimum of 70 times, counting only the times it fell onto a hard surface more than 3 feet drop.

&amp;#x200B;

Samsung, can you say that any of your new age phones can survive that? No?

&amp;#x200B;

So why are you designing your phones this way? For real. No really, I want to know the truth. Perhaps you can fill us in on what influences your decisions to make flimsy phones that break at the slightest accident and can't be repaired so easily or kept alive for long. Its ok if you say money, everyone suspects that anyway, but here's your chance to defend yourself and explain the science behind why you chose to make phones both weaker, irreparable, and more expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to back up this post in case it gets deleted, it violates no rules, is not offensive, or harassing, and contains no inflammatory language. This post fosters reasonable discussion requesting some input behind design choices and is directly related to samsung. There's no tech support here, its not a self promotion and its not buying selling or trading anything. There is also no photography here and no memes. Thus, my post follows all the rules. The only reason it would be removed, is if Samsung does not want such content to be seen by anyone else bringing up the idea that their phones may actually be designed with the intention that they break easy so that you are forced to go out and buy new ones.

My boyfriend likes this [Samsung Refrigerator ](https://low.es/2OW1WJ8) the best but the guy at Lowes and woman at Home Depot both said almost every complaint for Samsung refrigerators in general is the ice maker which was confirmed by a lot of the negative reviews. The only problem is, we looked at pretty much every fridge up to 3.5k from different brands and most of the bad reviews were either it breaking down in less than a year or ice maker problems. Anybody here have any good experiences with a Samsung fridge especially with its longevity? 

It’s hard to trust these 4+ star ratings when the actual reviews aren’t that good. A company trying to sell a $3,000 fridge obviously isn’t going to display a product having overall 2 star rating so id like to hear the unbiased opinions and I’m not sure where else to get that other than on here and the comment sections on YouTube under the reviews. I also think a normal person that isn’t a habitual reviewer of everything would be more likely to leave a negative review because they had a bad experience than they would to leave a good one.

First problem I have read is mostly because of Roku but the sound does not sync very well. I have read this is a roku thing and my step dad tends to leave the tv on all day and I know streaming tv can go out of snyc, but even when its off for a bit or reset it seems to be out of sync through just the tv speakers. The samsung tv has a slider that can adjust the audio if it is out of sync but that doesn't do anything. (first time I have ever seen that feature on a tv) 

For the sound bar when its in 'tv' mode the sound bar seems to wirelessly link with the tv for audio even when I shut off bluetooth on the sound bar. I thought having a direct plug via the pass through on the tv hdmi would solve the audio trouble but no luck.

Since then I'm stuck on the January first security update. I actually know there is already March security update available and the one for April will start rolling out soon.

My Note 9 is sim free, I bought it and I live in Hungary but the phone was made for the Malaysian market. The Pie update came when it was released in Malaysia, before the factory reset I was connected to the Malaysian support and wasn't eligible for the Hungarian Samsung members coupons, now I am, but as the title says no updates since then. So it's a pretty odd situation.

Anyone know if there's a workaround? I did try to connect it to the PC and start smart switch, it should have pop up the updates, but it said my phone has the latest update.

and it's horrid in my opinion.

As far as I can tell, there's no customization (besides it changing while being in night mode), its so laggy whenever I select someone from the messages list, and takes forever to open up the conversation. On top of that, It doesn't show the message I just sent until after at least 10 seconds (aka, instead of the little circle that shows it's sending, it just shows nothing). Restarting doesn't help either.

So my questions are if anyone else has these issues, or if I can fix them somehow.

Also, what should I have the group conversations on? Under Multimedia messages, it has the option of ""Send messages as group conversations by default."" It's a little vague, and i'm not sure if turning this on or off will make group chats work better.

So here's a good one...

I purchased my Note 9 (Unlocked) through Samsung last November and traded in my Note 5.  They would only give $100 credit for it, but hey... $100 is $100, right?

Well several month past by and a couple weeks ago, I got an email from Samsung saying ""Trade-In Requirements Not Met"" and they were charging $100 to my invoice.  This was odd, I thought, because I'm that guy that takes stellar care of his devices.  I hop on a chat service to see what requirements weren't met and they tell me that the retun package didn't have any device in it.  Yep... the box was empty.  

After a lot of back and forth they basically tell me there's no way I can prove that I did, in fact, mail the trade-in back.  I suggested the possibility of perhaps they have some employees with sticky fingers, but they say there's no way that could be the case because stealing is a serious offence.  ...Right... because criminals don't break the law.  I took pictures of the Note 5 before I sent it back and have the FedEx receipt, but that doesn't prove anything.  Tell me something...  If I was really trying to pull a quick one, don't you think I would've figured it out that when Samsung receives my return trade-in and there's nothing in the box, I would've been charged the $100?   ...In the end, they said they'd open a case and investigate some.

Well... just got another email saying the same thing, Requirements not met and they're charging me $100.  Pretty shady.  Now I'm out a perfectly good phone and $100.  Has this happened to anyone?  I've found complaints about people saying Samsung denying the trade-in because it had crack, etc, even though they sent in phones that were in perfect conditions.  

I've been a loyal Samsung Galaxy customer since the Galaxy S and this is how they treat customers.  I'll tell ya, between this and their laziness with the Pie update, I'm through with Samsung, moving forward.  I can deal with the slow/lazy approach to the Pie release for Note 9, but to pull this junk over $100... I'm done.

I know... boo who...  My leaving Samsung won't hurt them, but I believe in principals and doing the right thing.  Treating loyal customers with some respect and maybe even benefit of the doubt; not like they're all expendable pieces of garbage.  I hope that this will at least raise some level of concern from Samsung, but will probably never make it past ""customer support"".  

For anyone out there contemplating trading in your device, do so with caution and document as much as possible.

Thanks to anyone who at least reads this.  Goodbye Samsung,

Ive been using the galaxy buds now for two weeks.

The major ocdproblem ive been having is that my right bud will mostly never charge over 95%. I have managed a couple of times with various resets to get it charge to 100% but mostly not.

I also discovered the other day that my right bud (after 5 hours of listening with a 1 hour break in the middle) were down to 20% battery and my left had 50%. I mainly use the right bud for controls if that could make such a difference? But it feels like the problem is that the right bud charges slower than the left bud. 

It feels like this problem makes my charging case drain itself.

Ive noticed the little ""goldish marks"" where the charging pins go in have gotten little black spots. But this is only paint right? Cant be corrision of some sort? My buds always land dry in the case.

My last concern is the touch controls. I often have to take out the buds just to realise the touch controls wont work so i have to put then back into the case and then it works.

I have done alot of resets to the buds so that aint fixing anything in the long run.

I want to hear if anyone been in contact with samsung regarding these issues? I know ive seen all this issues here but couldnt find the threads. 

Thanks Reddit, you are the best.",samsung,2019-04-08 21:00:07
bazhmp,"So I've had the S10+ ceramic white since it came out and I've loved it. I also have the galaxy watch but 
I've noticed while trying to charge my watch on my phone is nearly impossible. Both the watch back and phone back are the smoothest surfaces in the universe and slide with the mildest of vibrations causing the watch to not align perfectly with that small area they give you. I haven't had issues charging other phone or my galaxy Buds but I find charging any watch via powershare is a constant struggle.

It doesn't help that the watch vibrates as soon as you spend a minute aligning it causing it to slide off the charge area leaving you unaware if it's charging or not. 

Has anyone found a technique for this?

I personally think Samsung should have added a slightly rough surface where the powershare area is to show just exactly where the boundaries are while also keeping your device stable.

I have to resume playing from my phone and can no longer use the touch pads on the earbuds. Within seconds of stopping running, I hear the sound that indicates they're back in my ears and can use the touch controls again. It's only when running - I can wear them around the house or for walks without issue.

I looked through Samsung's website and it doesn't look like they sell just the case separately.  If I were to buy a new pear of earbuds, would I at least be able to charge my old buds on the new case, or is it are all buds uniquely paired with their case? Also, are there any substitutes for the charging case?

Recently I upgraded from a Samsung J3 2016 (or so) to a J3 Achieve (2018?). Texting on the new phone is a little weird. Any text over a certain character limit gets turned from an SMS to an MMS. In addition, the phone said that the MMS will be send the next time I am connected to phone data. Although I was connected to WIFI, it only seemed to send when turning the data on.

Now I did find a option that automatically makes text into group conversations and turned it off. Doesn't seem to be doing much.

In the end, ideally, I would like to be able to just write my whole text as an SMS and send it. Is this possible at all?
Do I just need to break my SMS up into segments? And when I do want to send an MMS, either with pictures or to a group, can I do so over WIFI or to I have to use the data?

Any advice on this silliness?

I'm surprised with all the usage I have I end the day with 30-40% capacity left from a full charge.

I am genuinely impressed by how long the battery lasts.  I hope the battery maintains this same sort of resilience a year or two from now, as that's when you get to see how much these companies put into the quality of their batteries when they hit those particular milestones in their lifespan.

bb6vor,"Hi everyone,

I bought the *Samsung Q9FN 55 inch* a couple of months ago and I love it. However, recently, I am starting to get confused with two things:

1. Should I be using HDR + mode for HDR/4K content on Netflix/Amazon? For example, Our Planet on Netflix or Jack Ryan on Amazon. I notice when I have it turned off, it says I am watching HDR / 1080p on Amazon, but when I turn it on I am watching it in full HDR. But to be honest, I have no idea? I've calibrated the TV exactly how I want it, but now doubting if I am getting the full HDR content as it's meant to be seen if HDR + mode is off. I thought that the TV automatically showed the HDR content natively on a TV like this (even if I am in movie mode). Thoughts?
2. Am I getting the full HDR/4k content from the TV natively? As in, I am not using Apple TV, or a PS4 PRO. I assume yes, since the picture quality is fantastic, but again having doubts - though for a TV that is this new and cost that much, I believe the native apps built into the TV steam full HDR/4K, right?

I guess I am just trying to gain clarity on if I should use HDR + mode at all, or not? Even for HDR/4K content.

Thanks in advance for the technical help on this one.

bbovew,"My Galaxy S10+ is now my primary laptop after buying a [portable 15.6"" touchscreen monitor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P5D797X/ref=cfb_at_prodpg) from a company called UPERFECT. I thought I'd share my experience with the group here in case it's helpful to others.  

The monitor connects directly to my Samsung Galaxy S10+ with just one (included) USB-C cable. No HDMI cable necessary. And the **touchscreen on the monitor actually works**! A second USB-C cable connects to my [Aukey USB-C PD power bank](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079Z4RHZZ/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) for use on-the-go (or the included USB-C wall charger when at home). 

Once attached, the Samsung Galaxy S10+ starts in DeX mode. My company uses Office 365, so all of my documents open directly from the cloud. The combination of this monitor with the Samsung Galaxy S10+ is like having a combination of phone, giant tablet computer and laptop all at once. I use a Logitech bluetooth wireless [keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0148NPH9I/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and [mouse](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LF37K80/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) for even greater control.

By enabling the Samsung DeX developer features, it's possible to run mobile apps like Netflix, Amazon Video and Plex in full-screen mode, making this the best mobile movie-watching experience I've ever had - especially when paired with my [Bose Bluetooth true wireless earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundSport-Truly-Wireless-Headphones/dp/B0748JM8M5/ref=sr_1_3?crid=WU47NE78TB88&amp;keywords=bose+true+wireless+earbuds&amp;qid=1554917754&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=bose+true%2Caps%2C162&amp;sr=8-3). The screen is 16x9, so there's much less letterboxing than watching movies on an iPad - TV shows fit perfectly. And with a [bluetooth game pad](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0748S3GXG/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1), it's also an amazing portable gaming monitor. In addition to Android games, the monitor and game pad even work with my Nintendo Switch. 

My only gripe is that the Comcast Xfinity app blocks use under DeX. Being able to have a fully portable 15.6"" TV with DVR shows on the go would have been amazing. Anyone know a workaround for this?

At $299 ($279 with coupon) this monitor is one of the best technology investments I've ever made.

bbs5pu,"So I have been using Samsung since the note edge and every note since then till now the note 8 from 2017, waiting for the release of the note 10.  I bought the extended warranty with the phone because the sales told me that their new warranty will be able to cover the cost of replacing my screen if I dropped the phone and cracked it and etc. it sounded like a really good deal to me, so I got it. Since the day I got the phone, I realize that there was a really small black half circle on the right side screen, but I always thought it was a problem with the app that I was using or some sort of software issue and didn't bother about it because it was so small. Recently I came across a post and some youtube videos about other users majority of them are note 8 specifically having the same issue and they say it is a hardware issue (defect) of dead pixels and they were able to send it to Samsung to replace or fix it. So I contacted the online support about this, then they told me to contact the service center and then told me to call the service line. but I wanted to be sure so I went into a service center in person to ask about this. Arriving at the service center no one came and ask for help even though it was empty and there were at least five or six people standing around. so I went to the desk and asked what could be the problem and how I can get it fixed and how much it would cost (expected zero or at most $50 due to the warranty). The two people that were at the table had a very disrespectful attitude the entire time. They took the phone and saw the cracks on my screen and said it is a hardware issue but it is not the phone's problem it is because I dropped it. although I explained it has been there since the beginning but they didn't believe me and just kept repeating that it is 100% my problem and they will not be able to fix it for free. So I asked how much will it cost and what it will replace or fix. they said anything that causes the problem will be replaced and it'll cost $130 and then tax, but they cannot fix it today I will have to call and get a service number and then come back. But $130 is a lot of money for this small problem, and I don't think it is worth it since we are just 4 months away from the note 10 release. Now I understand that it is the procedure that in order to get my phone fixed I have to call and get a number and then come back and fix the phone, but it is their attitude that gets me mad. and I just want to know that what does the warranty even cover, if it cannot replace a screen, cannot fix a defect and it charges such a high price for fixing. What was the $200 warranty I paid for even for? And why do salespeople say things that are not true in order to sell the warranty?  
 I like Samsung and I don't think I will switch to any other phones, but I just never had such a bad experience on warranties and bad attitude salesmen. I also don't think I will ever spend money on Samsung's warranty if they are not able to fix anything they promise. (I agree maybe it is my problem that I didn't check online to see what the warranty covers, but it is rare for someone to go buy a phone and on the spot to do research on products such as the warranty)

I know carrier sim card flashes carrier firmware on galaxy nowadays, but it does not mean it will be activated in that network. I tried to activate verizon galaxy note 9 on sprint, but it cannot be activated.

It is not matter with unlocked, firmware, compatibility. It is probably because of IMEI not in sprint system to recognize it.

About 3 weeks ago I upgraded TV's and bought a 55inch Smart TV (UN55NU7100FXZA), and everything was great, was streaming UHD on Netflix, everything was playing in 4K smoothly on Youtube, the whole 9. So then I was away from home for about 2 weeks, and then when I come back yesterday... I can hardly stream 1080p without buffering every 30 seconds. Wtf?

For context, my internet speeds float at around 150 down/25 up with a single digit ping. This is current, I can get these results on any device in my house in any room on the same connection, and I assumed the Smart TV shared the same results until recently. Right now I can't test higher than 23 down/ 7 up with a ping anywhere from 130-270 on my TV. 

Yesterday I got on the online support with Samsung and the fella factory restored my TV's settings, checked for all the updates, and changed the DNS to 8.8.8.8, seemed to work for a little while but then today it's the same thing, can't even stream at a shitty 1080p. So it's obviously not my internet considering I can stream the highest possible resolution on any other device in my house, so what gives?! Everything was going good with the TV until just recently and I have no idea what it could be. This is honestly so frustrating taking into account what the TV is supposed to do, my internet connection, and that it wasn't doing this when I bought it. 

Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions? There's clearly something wrong that neither Samsung support nor I can figure out so I'm really hoping someone does. I'm this close to returning the thing if it honestly can't even stream 1080p. Thanks.",samsung,2019-03-31 18:26:13

I have zero experience with Samsung notebooks and haven't found a comparison review or tutorial. Any website you guys could point me to, or any suggestions at all for another 2-in-one device, for that matter? I like Samsung for their Galaxy Notes and their TVs so that was my first thought when I decided to get a 2-in-1 laptop/tablet, but I'm not exactly interested in limiting my options. I just want one that's a ""laptop first"", i.e. one that has the computing power one would expect from a good laptop as opposed to a tablet with a physical keyboard.

As for specs, 16GB RAM would be nice but I guess 8GB could do if there are no good options. 512GB or 1TB SSD is always nice to have, but frankly I store almost everything on the cloud nowadays so I could probably live with a 256GB SSD. I'm not really willing to go with less than 15"" though, so that might help narrow down the pool a bit. Now the processors always lose me — they're all i7 but there are still so many of them, and I'm not very familiar with how much a difference in clock interferes in the subjective perception of performance and lags. I mean I'm not going to crunch benchmarking numbers, know what I mean? As long as it feels fast, responsive and lasting (i.e. keeps up with other high-end laptops for a few years), I'm good.

I do some programming and 3D rendering sometimes, and also the occasional video editing in Premiere once in a blue moon. I'm not really a PC gamer but there's always a first time if the machine supports it. Photoshop, Illustrator and dozens of open Chrome tabs including YouTube and Netflix are more characteristic of my typical day.

I was ready to take the hit to sound quality for the freedom but my god... these things sound amazing. 

After some playing around with the wingtips and ear bud tips to find the best fitting and seal I pressed play on 'Deutschland' and was blown away with how clear it was on the default setting. Good bass without needing the bass boost. The other settings... not so good but that 'Dynamic' setting works beautifully. Find the right combo of wing and tip and boom.

Setting the long press to Google Assistant also lets me perform actions on the phone or call without needing to take my phone out.

Overall, super impressed and glad I didnt put the purchase off even longer. For anyone on the fence... get off it.

Tried various adapters, cleaning it with a white eraser and rubbing alcohol to no avail. Never dropped it or got it wet. Just plain stopped working. Most of my photos are backed using Google, but I'm really mad about my music. Contacted Samsung and they said they would send a replacement, but I'd rather use a Sandisk. I'm just disappointed.

I got the Android pie update yesterday on my S8 and i went to see the built in command option, which allows you to activate any speakable command with bixby by pressing the button, but you can only do either pause or play, rather than toggle, and for whatever reason, bixby does nothing without internet, and i do a lot of stuff in airplane mode, including listen to music. That isnt all, of course, because i also cant use bixby unless the phone is both awake and unlocked  which makes it even more useless. But the thing that irritates me the most is that the only direct controls you have for music in bixby is for spotify. I use Samsung Music all the time, barely even touch spotify, and they dont even support their own music app with their own support assistant.

I received a damaged s10 and have been trying to return it close to a month now.  I've spent hours with customer support and have been promised multiple times to get a return label which to this date has never arrived.  Now.. Samsung is telling me it's completely too late to return the phone and that it's my fault for taking so long to do it. I've been put on hold for hours and even hung up on while waiting.

I'm just saddened how horrible this entire experience has been if anyone has any advice I would love to hear it.  

The ""manager"" told me that since everything is automated there's nothing he can do in order to fix the issue and once it's past the return date he can't issue a return label.  ",samsung,2019-04-01 21:09:08
b89cym," I´ve been waiting for Android to catch up on quality apps versus iOS, but it seems is just not going to happen, even as Apple has many issues with iOS, is miles ahead of Android.

&amp;#x200B;

Specially on new flagship android phones like the new Samsung S10+ with gorgeous hardware, superb cameras and video, all of this ruined by poorly optimized apps!  The hardware is so amazing but everything is ruined if the apps you love and use the most behave like crap on the platform!

&amp;#x200B;

The best example is Instagram, on android this apps behaves like a beta version from 2013, many iOS features are not present on the android version, many things don´t work well, is not tuned for the 18:9 (specially for stories) or other aspect ratios but the worst thing of all is the quality of photos, videos and audio for the stories, it´s so bad that is almost unbelievable!

&amp;#x200B;

Why Samsung is not doing everything it can to solve this issue!? Now they worked with instagram for the camera instagram feature, why they can´t work together to fix this? I think we need to force all of Silicon Valley Programmers to forcefully use Android for a month in order to make it better, I really want to like it but there are just way too many issues.

b8am85,"After realizing that my 2017 Moto X4 sounded worse than my 1991 Motorola brick phone on AT&amp;T, I took advantage of the Costco $200 cash back and bought an S10e.  So far likes and dislikes:

- call quality: very good, but TBH I am not impressed. It's 2019 and it's not quite where it should be. Much better than the X4 but still not as good as landline.

- Wireless is great. I even got 5G (😂). Works pretty well. Faster than the X4. 

- WiFi is solid

- Samsung skin is minimal. Good. Settings confusing a bit

- Display is very good and flat. I would have gotten the S10 if offered with a flat screen.

- battery life is ok. I'm still learning the ropes. 

- physical size: just perfect except for the guy who specified glass back. Slipperier than an eel immersed in WD-40. Spigen case arrives tomorrow

- punchhole is not noticeable. A friend sent a link to hilarious backgrounds that cover the hole, the one with Kim Jong Un is priceless. Google it.

- gaming is exceptional. Angry Birds 2 flies (pun not intended). I'm running at medium power mode CPU at 70%. Not noticeable.

- setup troubles thanks to Android noted in another post. Password party in progress.

- wireless charging rocks. Borrowed a friend's pad to test, OMG. Life changing. Buying one.

- akg wired buds. Excellent sound quality. A bit cheesy build but good sound.

Overall happy, just waiting for the case to come in.

b8lj36,"I'm curious if others have had the same or a similar experience to me trying to use their eCertificate.

The whole process of purchasing the S10 and using the promotional $130 eCertificate to purchase the Galaxy Buds has been an unnecessary hassle, and very unprofessionally handled by Samsung. The customer service during this process has been absolutely atrocious.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a list of gripes I have about this whole thing. I'm curious if anyone else picked up on this, and finds this whole thing a bit fishy: 

\- It wasn't clear that you would need to wait weeks after receiving your phone to even get the eCertificate code.

\-There have been conflicting emails from Samsung, and an overall severe lack of communication about the process from start to finish. 

\-Samsung Phone support explained that this was done so the code would be sent right after the return window closed for the phone. I guess I understand this from Samsung's perspective, but that should have been well communicated to each customer.

\- Promotional emails that I received prior to purchasing the S10 state that the following regarding the use of the eCertificate: 

&gt;"" By 4﻿/﻿4﻿/﻿1﻿9, using your Qualifying Purchase device, follow instructions on the Shop Samsung app (""App"") to submit required info. ""

\-It says in the eCertificate email that it expires 06/27/19. I'm not sure which email(s) to believe.

\-The galaxy buds have been out of stock for a while with no way to reserve them or put your name down on a list to receive them once they are available again.

\-The support experience is bad at best. The online chat takes 20 minutes to get in contact with anyone, trying to get someone on the phone results in talking to a robot that just keeps repeating itself, and once you get someone on the phone they advise to continuously check the website to know when the galaxy buds become available (This was later clarified by the customer service representative; where she told me that I could add the product to my wishlist)

\-Emails from Samsung recommend using the eCertificate for the Galaxy  Buds on the Shop Samsung app, however, the product seems to be completely taken off the app.

Then she said, ""What?"" in a confused manner. I replied, ""Nevermind, about a charger. I forgot I could this thing with my phone that can charge other people's phones (Wireless PowerShare)."" As I started up Wireless PowerShare on my S10+, she asked, ""What do I do now?"" And I said, ""Just place your phone on top of mine."" As she placed her iPhone on top of the back of my S10+, I noticed that her phone was at 1% and as her phone vibrated to notify her that her phone was charging; she thought it was so cool. After like 10-15 minutes of charging her phone to 15%, she said thanks and after class she was so amazed that she is now thinking of switching from iPhone to Samsung.

TL;DR: I charged my classmate's iPhone with Wireless PowerShare on my S10+, and she was wowed by the feature that she is now thinking of getting a Samsung.

My thoughts: I think that it is so cool that the Wireless PowerShare function bridges the gap of charging other phones than Samsung that are compatible with Wireless Charging, such as iPhone.

b8s8jt,"Hi guys.

&amp;#x200B;

I figured that i should be transparent with you all regarding events that unfolded yesterday. Transparency with subreddit users is important, to me atleast,  and i feel as though i should let you know what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start from the beginning. 

&amp;#x200B;

I joined this subreddit nearly 2 months ago. My prior moderation experience was.. rather limited to say the least. I was only a moderator (now former) of r/iOSGaming. I was there for approx 3-4 months before i came across r/samsung. What i saw was an abundance of spam, shit posts etc. That i'm sure old users can attest to before the new mod team came a long. I saw that the two top moderators were fairly inactive on the subreddit, but fairly active on other parts of Reddit. So, i decided to give it a shot and message both of them (and create a post) to try see if they needed help. A few days later, i got added to the team.

&amp;#x200B;

When i got added, i immediately started working on rebuilding this subreddit. My first action was to open applications for moderator positions. A few days passed, and i added a couple Moderators to the r/Samsung team. We then started work on rebuilding / expanding the subreddit - **Here is our changelog since the other Moderators and myself were added:**

&amp;#x200B;

# Changelog:

&amp;#x200B;

* We added new Rules.
* A new Banner / icon (Thanks KAS30).
*  Started work on the wiki (Yet to be finished).
*  A proper subreddit description.
*  Added a competent Auto-Mod (This has vastly improved the subreddit overall, reduced spam etc).
*  Added a Tech Support / WSIB thread.
*  Added a Wallpaper Auto-Mod Thread.
* Made a Subreddit Discord.
* Much, Much more behind the scenes stuff

**I also figured i'd let you know that when i was added, we had a mod queue backed up with 1000 items (Max capacity), and our Modmail was completely and utterly backed up years. Basically, this subreddit hadn't recieved a lot of Mod attention in a** ***very*** **long time.**

&amp;#x200B;

# While we're talking about transparency, Here is the mod log matrix showing each Moderators activity (3/3/2019 was when I got added):

&amp;#x200B;

# So, What's the point of this post?

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, Myself and other Moderators were talking about the future of the subreddit. We all mutually agreed that this subreddit has really turned around since we all got added. I, personally, brought up that our two top mods hadn't been doing much in Moderating - All the mods agreed. The mod log matrix i showed above can clearly prove my claim. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, before i move on, i'd like to mention that I know moderation isn't easy. We get abused on a daily basis, we get told we're faggots. That we should kill ourselves etc. But we don't let that get to us. What a lot of people seem to forget is Moderation is completely Voluntary, as it should be. Moderation isn't a job we get paid for by Reddit. Stuff can happen in real life (like a death in the family etc) that can also cause activity to go down.**

&amp;#x200B;

So, carrying on, After all the mods mutually agreed that the top mods were inactive i decided to messaged the top mod, Perma. I will give you the full message that i sent him, again, i want to be as transparent as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/5llk8v8ihyp21.png

Now, before you say anything, i know i was rather blunt. But for context, i was being honest, also bear in mind i had **zero** clue Perma and Renegade were the original moderators/creators of the subreddit. It may look bad on my part, but again, i said what myself and the other Moderators agreed on.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, please refer to the mod matrix if you think i'm lying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, after that 3rd message, Perma added 3 new moderators without consulting a single person of the moderation team. All the moderators were confused and really, **really concerned.**

&amp;#x200B;

In the discord i mentioned to Renegade he needs to take over and do the top mod removal procedure ASAP. I, and others said that because we were genuinely concerned something bad was going to happen. It may look hypocritical on my part because **i did** say to Perma, to remove Renegade. However that DM was done before the 3 random mods were invited to moderate. I was concerned so i asked Renegade to start the removal procedure asap because myself and others were concerned that Perma was going to do something really bad.

&amp;#x200B;

A short while after Perma joined the discord server, posted a screenshot of our conversation and stated that it seems i'm a drama causer. He mentioned that it looks like i'm trying to turn Renegade and himself (Perma) against eachother. **Which, admittedly, it does.** After that, Perma removed me as Moderator of the subreddit and as Administrator of the Discord. citing that i cause too much drama.

&amp;#x200B;

Me, him, renegade, and the other mods had a long conversation and he finally agreed to add me back. Which i'm thrilled about. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, /r/samsung reddit mods and r/Samsung discord mods are slowly leaving. Because they can see this situation has been blown way out of proportion, and they don't want to be involved in a subreddit where you can't be honest with one another. Without getting yourself kicked from the subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not surprised if this post gets removed and i get removed as moderator. I'd hope the two top mods would see this as transparency and feel it's a good thing. ***one can only hope.*** **I am not a drama causer, nor am i here to cause subreddit drama. I'm here to help out a community I care about, that is my mission. I'd hope the changes myself and the other mods would prove that.**

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways. Thats all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Transparency report... Done.

b8sltr,"Hi, I got myself the S10+ directly from Samsung's online store and in the past 2 weeks I've been noticing that it reboots at random when I'm not using it. Sometimes its on my desk at work or at home, and I'll notice it just rebooting by itself when I'm not even touching it.

It reboots on average once a day, usually in the afternoon. Sometimes it never reboots or reboots multiple times in a single day.

I was wondering if anyone else is getting this, and if anyone has had this issue in the past with a brand new device. I tried searching for solutions on the internet, but what I have found is mostly posts about the same issue on the Samsung forums with no actual answer from the Samsung support team.

I can live with this problem since I've yet to experience the reboot while I'm actively using the device, but it just annoys me as this is a brand new phone (which I haven't dropped) and I love the rest of my experience with it as of writting this. Its the only flaw I found with it yet.

I would legitimately buy a top of the line S10+ if it had Windows 10 launch on an external display rather than Dex.

Samsung had a promotion that if you trade in your S8 (2 models ago), you can get $300 toward any of the new S10’s. As long as it works, no cracks, etc. Versus getting $150 from the “normal” trade in. So I’m like eff it! I’ll order one! May as well get the most for this phone before I really need a new one
 
I followed the instructions to the T on the Samsung app and my order started processing last Thursday. They said they’ll include a return label with the new phone, just do a reset on the old one, throw it in, slap on the new label, send it back within 15 days. No problem.
 
I waited…waited…waited…. Then today I get an email “Your Samsung order has been CANCELLED.”   WTF?!?!?!
 
So I call Samsung and they’re like “Oh your carrier cancelled it. Doesn’t say why. You need to call Verizon. Sorry, son.”
 
I call Verizon…person puts me on hold to look up what happened. Comes back and says “Ok it looks like the phone was sent to some random store like a Best Buy or Sears, they didn’t know what to do with it, so they sent it back to Samsung. You need to call Samsung and let them know.”
 
I call Samsung and tell them. They’re like “Oh how weird. Yeah, we’ve heard of that happening and we don’t know why.”   Uhhh????   “Try ordering it again. Maybe it was just a mistake.”
 
I’m like fine. Let me try it again. I go online, and before I get to the ordering step – THE DAMN PROMOTION IS ALREADY OVER! It’s back to only $150 trade-in value for my phone…
 
I call Samsung again. I’m like look, YOU effed up and now this happened. I want the full $300 trade-in value I would have gotten if you didn’t ship my other phone to some random store. Guy’s all “I can’t do anything. Place the order, then call Samsung and see if they’ll do a price match.”

I have found many Samsung apps to actually be better than Google's, especially with the OneUI update and some of Google's in a mess, but right now I am reaching a point where it is affecting my contacts and such to a point that I am annoyed.

When I am on my phone, I have multiple ways to contact people on any given app.

On Samsung Messages, if I tap on one person's icon to open the contact info for them, it will open properly. If I tap on a second, it will say ""CONTACT NOT FOUND"" even though they are linked and in my phone\contacts for both Google and Samsung - and I can access it any way. I can even type them in as a person to send a contact.

Then there is the issue that Samsung and Google contacts do not always format phone numbers the exact same, leading to minor issues here and there with area codes, international codes, etc.

Last, I noticed if I go into my Samsung account and look at a contact, it lists a whole 4 or 5 ""LINKED CONTACTS"" with the same information.

I thought that I already merged all my duplicate contacts with my Google contacts long ago? I did not have any issues with this on my Galaxy Note8, even with the version of the OneUI apps I had on there.

Here's what I am getting at:  I am positive I am not missing any setting, but running into the inevitable. Easy contact syncing between phone\email\contacts was possible with Android 8 and my Note8, but updates and overhauls have created a problem where it is messing up again.

**Do I even need to keep my Samsung account active on my phone? Can I uninstall the Contacts and Messages apps by using the ADB force-uninstall command? I am sure it will work but I do not want to break my phone too much**

I'm also tired of having two calendar apps.

I actually like all Samsung's but I need to be able to move in and out seamlessly between computer and phone and right now Samsung isn't providing the integration it had in the previous versions of these apps for me.

Even Maps is a bit too different.

b9d1rg,"I was hoping for an easy trade-in with Samsung.  I have no flaws on my Galaxy Note 8, I sent it in before the date that they asked.

My screen had no issues, no scratches, perfect condition.

The phone turns on and runs absolutely fine.

The last thing I did before I packed my Note8 up was to take out my SIM card and microSD card and then do a factory re-set.

The final screen I saw was when it rebooted after the reset and was ready to start the process from scratch - which I have done before.

So what happened? Why are they saying my device was NOT reset?? This is absurd, I have seen people get no credit before for other things but never the ""not factory reset""! 

Can someone help me or offer advice?  I have a week to call them before they charge me and I can have them ship the device back, but **I had a perfect condition Note8 and I want my $550 trade in!!**",samsung,2019-04-04 13:58:47

ba2df0,"So I ordered a Q9FN TV from Samsung.com on March 24th. It’s the 2018 model and with the newer model out, I thought I’d be a good opportunity to buy before it goes EOL and they run out. 

At the time, I was able to buy through the site, sign up for financing and picked my delivery date, which was today, April 5th. 

Took the day off work to wait for the scheduled delivery and nothing came. Checked the site, still says delivery date: April 5th. Contacted support and only after getting to a supervisor, they told me the TV is backordered. I had to go through support three times, with each tier 1 rep telling me they don’t know and they’d have to forward my email to another team. 

What pisses me off is that from the time I ordered til now, I was never notified at all. No email telling me there was a change, no notification telling me my shipment will not be coming. Everything pointed to a scheduled delivery date of April 5th. Support told me that they will send my case to their “concern” team, whatever the hell that is. I understand this a 2018 model and it might get sold out. It’s disappointing a company like Samsung’s own e-commerce site lets a customer go through the buy-flow and sign up for financing knowing they don’t have inventory. If I knew it was backordered, I never would have even ordered. I can’t cancel the order because I signed up for Samsung financing. A line of credit that is useless and will be a hit on my credit if I cancel. 

Has anyone else experienced backorder issues with Samsung.com? How did it get resolved? If I cancel the order, or if Samsung ends up canceling the order, what will happen with the Samsung financing? I got an email from them saying my finance info will be coming in the mail  soon (but they couldn’t send me a backorder notification?!). I see a lot of people here having preorder problems with their S10s on here. Samsung needs to get their shit together. ",samsung,2019-04-06 08:39:39
ba367k,"I'm quite annoyed at this point. Samsung phones are bombs. I had an S3 for like, 4-5 years and replaced the battery in it twice. One time the battery expanded so vastly that it cracked the hard shell double layer protective case I had on the phone, and then the back plate **literally** exploded off the back of the phone from pure pressure and bounced off the car windows 4 times before landing in the back seat while my mother was driving and out plopped this ball of a battery 3 times the thickness of the battery its self ready to pop any second. This ball of a battery landed right between my legs, had it exploded I would no longer have been a male.  Luckily, however, it started to deflate on its own, and I happened to be right near a battery shop where I walked in with it, placed it on the counter, the guy dived back as if I placed a bomb on the countertop and I said ""I need a new one of these"" and just popped a new one in and carried on about my day. I had to replace it again a year alter because it also began expanding but I replaced it far sooner that time.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have an S8. Where you GLUE THE BATTERY INSIDE THE PHONE.... For no reason. You just, make your phone deliberately bad. Rounded edges so you can't use a screen protector and can't get a decent case either. You glue the battery inside the case, you glue the case on so it can't be opened up. Is your business plan to design portable airport safe BOMBS? Or is it just to make sure people have to replace their entire phone yearly?

&amp;#x200B;

Don't give me that crap about people wanting ""thinner phones with no edges"".  No one wants that except the people you train to want that by repeating ""everyone wants it, everyone wants it, everyone wants it, everyone wants it"" in their ear every day for years on in till they grow up thinking its true. You can see people going out and buying protective cases for their phones, clearly phone thickness isn't a problem if you're willing to triple the size of your phone to protect it. Clearly, screen edges aren't an issue if you're willing to cling a phone protector on there that adds to the screen's edge.

&amp;#x200B;

Its bad enough your phone is so ridiculously long that it can't fit in my jacket chest pockets now. I was out on a jog and the phone bounced up and out of the pocket and landed on the corner cracking the screen, luckily because I had a phone protector on it, the cracks were very minimal and I just keep using it as is. However had you not had a ROUND screen, it wouldn't have sustained any damage. I would have both, been able to put a screen protector on it, and the screen would never have sustained such a close indirect impact with the cement falling 4 feet. How do I know this? Because I dropped my S3, many MANY times. Even face down on its screen landing on rocks, with its tempered glass screen protector, it didn't even sustain a single scratch. That phone is still alive, and still works even today. I set it up as a kids toy for a friend with kid games and learning apps after I replaced the battery inside a 3rd time. That phone sustained more drops than any new age phone could possibly take. Your new age phones, one drop shatters them. My S3 was dropped a minimum of 70 times, counting only the times it fell onto a hard surface more than 3 feet drop.

&amp;#x200B;

Samsung, can you say that any of your new age phones can survive that? No?

&amp;#x200B;

So why are you designing your phones this way? For real. No really, I want to know the truth. Perhaps you can fill us in on what influences your decisions to make flimsy phones that break at the slightest accident and can't be repaired so easily or kept alive for long. Its ok if you say money, everyone suspects that anyway, but here's your chance to defend yourself and explain the science behind why you chose to make phones both weaker, irreparable, and more expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to back up this post in case it gets deleted, it violates no rules, is not offensive, or harassing, and contains no inflammatory language. This post fosters reasonable discussion requesting some input behind design choices and is directly related to samsung. There's no tech support here, its not a self promotion and its not buying selling or trading anything. There is also no photography here and no memes. Thus, my post follows all the rules. The only reason it would be removed, is if Samsung does not want such content to be seen by anyone else bringing up the idea that their phones may actually be designed with the intention that they break easy so that you are forced to go out and buy new ones.

My boyfriend likes this [Samsung Refrigerator ](https://low.es/2OW1WJ8) the best but the guy at Lowes and woman at Home Depot both said almost every complaint for Samsung refrigerators in general is the ice maker which was confirmed by a lot of the negative reviews. The only problem is, we looked at pretty much every fridge up to 3.5k from different brands and most of the bad reviews were either it breaking down in less than a year or ice maker problems. Anybody here have any good experiences with a Samsung fridge especially with its longevity? 

It’s hard to trust these 4+ star ratings when the actual reviews aren’t that good. A company trying to sell a $3,000 fridge obviously isn’t going to display a product having overall 2 star rating so id like to hear the unbiased opinions and I’m not sure where else to get that other than on here and the comment sections on YouTube under the reviews. I also think a normal person that isn’t a habitual reviewer of everything would be more likely to leave a negative review because they had a bad experience than they would to leave a good one. People are also more tempted to call and complain than they are to call and compliment.

First problem I have read is mostly because of Roku but the sound does not sync very well. I have read this is a roku thing and my step dad tends to leave the tv on all day and I know streaming tv can go out of snyc, but even when its off for a bit or reset it seems to be out of sync through just the tv speakers. The samsung tv has a slider that can adjust the audio if it is out of sync but that doesn't do anything. (first time I have ever seen that feature on a tv) 

For the sound bar when its in 'tv' mode the sound bar seems to wirelessly link with the tv for audio even when I shut off bluetooth on the sound bar. I thought having a direct plug via the pass through on the tv hdmi would solve the audio trouble but no luck. 

If this is mostly the roku not syncing well I am thinking of getting their amazon echo cube from downstairs to try. But wanted to check if audio sync trouble is common samsung tvs? I also have sling via roku and never had any sync problems at my house.",samsung,2019-04-06 23:41:36

and it's horrid in my opinion.

As far as I can tell, there's no customization (besides it changing while being in night mode), its so laggy whenever I select someone from the messages list, and takes forever to open up the conversation. On top of that, It doesn't show the message I just sent until after at least 10 seconds (aka, instead of the little circle that shows it's sending, it just shows nothing). Restarting doesn't help either.

So my questions are if anyone else has these issues, or if I can fix them somehow.

Also, what should I have the group conversations on? Under Multimedia messages, it has the option of ""Send messages as group conversations by default."" It's a little vague, and i'm not sure if turning this on or off will make group chats work better.

I'm a mid-range phones kinda guy, I'm not ready to spend 1k$ on a phone. Latest Samsung I used however was Galaxy S4 a long time ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently using Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 and honestly it's pretty great and fast. However, what I like the most about the A5 2019 is that amazing OLED Samsung screen (Which my  current phone lacks). However I am worried that the One UI might be a bit hard to handle by A5 2019's processor which might lead to lag and not a smooth experience.

I also heart that speaker in the phone is very bad.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts? Anyone tried the phone and could give some feedback?

Thanks!",samsung,2019-04-08 04:41:34

I use Google Photos to back up all my pics from my Android devices. I'm currently using an S10+ coming from using the last two Pixel XL devices. When I switched to Sammy I found that Google Photos was unable to play motion photos taken from my S10+. Research into the issue revealed that Google Photos was unable to play motion photos taken by Sammy Phones due to differing code to Google's. 

I've just checked tonight and it's now working. Not sure when this changed or if it's well known, but I thought this may help someone out there.

So here's a good one...

I purchased my Note 9 (Unlocked) through Samsung last November and traded in my Note 5.  They would only give $100 credit for it, but hey... $100 is $100, right?

Well several month past by and a couple weeks ago, I got an email from Samsung saying ""Trade-In Requirements Not Met"" and they were charging $100 to my invoice.  This was odd, I thought, because I'm that guy that takes stellar care of his devices.  I hop on a chat service to see what requirements weren't met and they tell me that the retun package didn't have any device in it.  Yep... the box was empty.  

After a lot of back and forth they basically tell me there's no way I can prove that I did, in fact, mail the trade-in back.  I suggested the possibility of perhaps they have some employees with sticky fingers, but they say there's no way that could be the case because stealing is a serious offence.  ...Right... because criminals don't break the law.  I took pictures of the Note 5 before I sent it back and have the FedEx receipt, but that doesn't prove anything.  Tell me something...  If I was really trying to pull a quick one, don't you think I would've figured it out that when Samsung receives my return trade-in and there's nothing in the box, I would've been charged the $100?   ...In the end, they said they'd open a case and investigate some.

Well... just got another email saying the same thing, Requirements not met and they're charging me $100.  Pretty shady.  Now I'm out a perfectly good phone and $100.  Has this happened to anyone?  I've found complaints about people saying Samsung denying the trade-in because it had crack, etc, even though they sent in phones that were in perfect conditions.  

I've been a loyal Samsung Galaxy customer since the Galaxy S and this is how they treat customers.  I'll tell ya, between this and their laziness with the Pie update, I'm through with Samsung, moving forward.  I can deal with the slow/lazy approach to the Pie release for Note 9, but to pull this junk over $100... I'm done.

I know... boo who...  My leaving Samsung won't hurt them, but I believe in principals and doing the right thing.  Treating loyal customers with some respect and maybe even benefit of the doubt; not like they're all expendable pieces of garbage.  I hope that this will at least raise some level of concern from Samsung, but will probably never make it past ""customer support"".  

For anyone out there contemplating trading in your device, do so with caution and document as much as possible.

Thanks to anyone who at least reads this.  Goodbye Samsung,

Ive been using the galaxy buds now for two weeks.

The major ocdproblem ive been having is that my right bud will mostly never charge over 95%. I have managed a couple of times with various resets to get it charge to 100% but mostly not.

I also discovered the other day that my right bud (after 5 hours of listening with a 1 hour break in the middle) were down to 20% battery and my left had 50%. I mainly use the right bud for controls if that could make such a difference? But it feels like the problem is that the right bud charges slower than the left bud. 

It feels like this problem makes my charging case drain itself.

Ive noticed the little ""goldish marks"" where the charging pins go in have gotten little black spots. But this is only paint right? Cant be corrision of some sort? My buds always land dry in the case.

My last concern is the touch controls. I often have to take out the buds just to realise the touch controls wont work so i have to put then back into the case and then it works.

I have done alot of resets to the buds so that aint fixing anything in the long run.

I've noticed while trying to charge my watch on my phone is nearly impossible. Both the watch back and phone back are the smoothest surfaces in the universe and slide with the mildest of vibrations causing the watch to not align perfectly with that small area they give you. I haven't had issues charging other phone or my galaxy Buds but I find charging any watch via powershare is a constant struggle.

It doesn't help that the watch vibrates as soon as you spend a minute aligning it causing it to slide off the charge area leaving you unaware if it's charging or not. 

Has anyone found a technique for this?

I personally think Samsung should have added a slightly rough surface where the powershare area is to show just exactly where the boundaries are while also keeping your device stable.

Recently I upgraded from a Samsung J3 2016 (or so) to a J3 Achieve (2018?). Texting on the new phone is a little weird. Any text over a certain character limit gets turned from an SMS to an MMS. In addition, the phone said that the MMS will be send the next time I am connected to phone data. Although I was connected to WIFI, it only seemed to send when turning the data on.

Now I did find a option that automatically makes text into group conversations and turned it off. Doesn't seem to be doing much.

In the end, ideally, I would like to be able to just write my whole text as an SMS and send it. Is this possible at all?
Do I just need to break my SMS up into segments? And when I do want to send an MMS, either with pictures or to a group, can I do so over WIFI or to I have to use the data?

I bought the *Samsung Q9FN 55 inch* a couple of months ago and I love it. However, recently, I am starting to get confused with two things:

1. Should I be using HDR + mode for HDR/4K content on Netflix/Amazon? For example, Our Planet on Netflix or Jack Ryan on Amazon. I notice when I have it turned off, it says I am watching HDR / 1080p on Amazon, but when I turn it on I am watching it in full HDR. But to be honest, I have no idea? I've calibrated the TV exactly how I want it, but now doubting if I am getting the full HDR content as it's meant to be seen if HDR + mode is off. I thought that the TV automatically showed the HDR content natively on a TV like this (even if I am in movie mode). Thoughts?
2. Am I getting the full HDR/4k content from the TV natively? As in, I am not using Apple TV, or a PS4 PRO. I assume yes, since the picture quality is fantastic, but again having doubts - though for a TV that is this new and cost that much, I believe the native apps built into the TV steam full HDR/4K, right?

I guess I am just trying to gain clarity on if I should use HDR + mode at all, or not? Even for HDR/4K content.

bbovew,"My Galaxy S10+ is now my primary laptop after buying a [portable 15.6"" touchscreen monitor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P5D797X/ref=cfb_at_prodpg) from a company called UPERFECT. I thought I'd share my experience with the group here in case it's helpful to others.  

The monitor connects directly to my Samsung Galaxy S10+ with just one (included) USB-C cable. No HDMI cable necessary. And the **touchscreen on the monitor actually works**! A second USB-C cable connects to my [Aukey USB-C PD power bank](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079Z4RHZZ/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) for use on-the-go (or the included USB-C wall charger when at home). 

Once attached, the Samsung Galaxy S10+ starts in DeX mode. My company uses Office 365, so all of my documents open directly from the cloud. The combination of this monitor with the Samsung Galaxy S10+ is like having a combination of phone, giant tablet computer and laptop all at once. I use a Logitech bluetooth wireless [keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0148NPH9I/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and [mouse](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LF37K80/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) for even greater control.

By enabling the Samsung DeX developer features, it's possible to run mobile apps like Netflix, Amazon Video and Plex in full-screen mode, making this the best mobile movie-watching experience I've ever had - especially when paired with my [Bose Bluetooth true wireless earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundSport-Truly-Wireless-Headphones/dp/B0748JM8M5/ref=sr_1_3?crid=WU47NE78TB88&amp;keywords=bose+true+wireless+earbuds&amp;qid=1554917754&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=bose+true%2Caps%2C162&amp;sr=8-3). The screen is 16x9, so there's much less letterboxing than watching movies on an iPad - TV shows fit perfectly. And with a [bluetooth game pad](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0748S3GXG/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1), it's also an amazing portable gaming monitor. In addition to Android games, the monitor and game pad even work with my Nintendo Switch. 

My only gripe is that the Comcast Xfinity app blocks use under DeX. Being able to have a fully portable 15.6"" TV with DVR shows on the go would have been amazing. Anyone know a workaround for this?

At $299 ($279 with coupon) this monitor is one of the best technology investments I've ever made.

I bought the extended warranty with the phone because the sales told me that their new warranty will be able to cover the cost of replacing my screen if I dropped the phone and cracked it and etc. it sounded like a really good deal to me, so I got it. Since the day I got the phone, I realize that there was a really small black half circle on the right side screen, but I always thought it was a problem with the app that I was using or some sort of software issue and didn't bother about it because it was so small. Recently I came across a post and some youtube videos about other users majority of them are note 8 specifically having the same issue and they say it is a hardware issue (defect) of dead pixels and they were able to send it to Samsung to replace or fix it. So I contacted the online support about this, then they told me to contact the service center and then told me to call the service line. but I wanted to be sure so I went into a service center in person to ask about this. Arriving at the service center no one came and ask for help even though it was empty and there were at least five or six people standing around. so I went to the desk and asked what could be the problem and how I can get it fixed and how much it would cost (expected zero or at most $50 due to the warranty). The two people that were at the table had a very disrespectful attitude the entire time. They took the phone and saw the cracks on my screen and said it is a hardware issue but it is not the phone's problem it is because I dropped it. although I explained it has been there since the beginning but they didn't believe me and just kept repeating that it is 100% my problem and they will not be able to fix it for free. So I asked how much will it cost and what it will replace or fix. they said anything that causes the problem will be replaced and it'll cost $130 and then tax, but they cannot fix it today I will have to call and get a service number and then come back. But $130 is a lot of money for this small problem, and I don't think it is worth it since we are just 4 months away from the note 10 release. Now I understand that it is the procedure that in order to get my phone fixed I have to call and get a number and then come back and fix the phone, but it is their attitude that gets me mad. and I just want to know that what does the warranty even cover, if it cannot replace a screen, cannot fix a defect and it charges such a high price for fixing. What was the $200 warranty I paid for even for? And why do salespeople say things that are not true in order to sell the warranty?  
 I like Samsung and I don't think I will switch to any other phones, but I just never had such a bad experience on warranties and bad attitude salesmen. I also don't think I will ever spend money on Samsung's warranty if they are not able to fix anything they promise. (I agree maybe it is my problem that I didn't check online to see what the warranty covers, but it is rare for someone to go buy a phone and on the spot to do research on products such as the warranty)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Bought warranty, cannot get the problem fixed for free or within the expected range. Had super bad attitude service. Probably won't buy the warranty coz it doesn't cover anything that's important I guess

I know carrier sim card flashes carrier firmware on galaxy nowadays, but it does not mean it will be activated in that network. I tried to activate verizon galaxy note 9 on sprint, but it cannot be activated.

It is not matter with unlocked, firmware, compatibility. It is probably because of IMEI not in sprint system to recognize it.

So I asked how much will it cost and what it will replace or fix. they said anything that causes the problem will be replaced and it'll cost $130 and then tax, but they cannot fix it today I will have to call and get a service number and then come back. But $130 is a lot of money for this small problem, and I don't think it is worth it since we are just 4 months away from the note 10 release. Now I understand that it is the procedure that in order to get my phone fixed I have to call and get a number and then come back and fix the phone, but it is their attitude that gets me mad. and I just want to know that what does the warranty even cover, if it cannot replace a screen, cannot fix a defect and it charges such a high price for fixing. What was the $200 warranty I paid for even for? And why do salespeople say things that are not true in order to sell the warranty?  
I like Samsung and I don't think I will switch to any other phones, but I just never had such a bad experience on warranties and bad attitude salesmen. I also don't think I will ever spend money on Samsung's warranty if they are not able to fix anything they promise. (I agree maybe it is my problem that I didn't check online to see what the warranty covers, but it is rare for someone to go buy a phone and on the spot to do research on products such as the warranty)

TL;DR Bought warranty, cannot get the problem fixed for free or within the expected range. Had super bad attitude service. Probably won't buy the warranty coz it doesn't cover anything that's important I guess

als4on,"Hey guys, long post incoming. If anyone has advice for how to get this problem resolved I would love to here it because I am beyond frustrated at this point. 

So about a year ago, I purchased a UN75MU6070 4k Tv. I was planning on waiting to get a better version, but the timing ended up being right and the price looked great (I was wrong on that). The first time I turned on the TV, everything looked great. I didn't have any 4k content to play on it yet, but Netflix shows and upscaled blu-rays looked awesome and I was very happy. A couple months later, my wife bought me a 4k Blu Ray player, and I purchased my first 4k BluRay. 

Now I don't know that this TV has what is called ""true HDR"", but it does have an approximation that makes colors richer. However, when I would watch a movie with HDR, the colors looked...off. In the highlights, everything looked too washed out, and in the shadows, everything looked flat and like it had no contrast. [Here](https://imgur.com/KBuwzik) are [some](https://imgur.com/XuarVkW) [comparison](https://imgur.com/8RfgrEL) shots. I know it's hard to tell from a phone picture, but you can see that the colors, brightness and contrast are very messed up when you see how the eye looks between HDR and SDR. 

I submitted a request for assistance and the rep had me update my firmware: this didn't change anything. Next, I called again, and the rep told me that the problem was HDR+. Even though the description on the setting itself says it automatically determines if HDR content is displaying and turns itself on or off, I took this as a possible solution. Turning it off did nothing to fix the problems.

I called a couple more times and talked to reps that tried to help but were unable to, until they finally sent out a local repair tech to look at the tv. By this point, I had gotten 4k netflix, and I could see the same problem with HDR content from that app, so I knew that this wasn't a Blu Ray player problem, it was a TV problem. Here are a [couple](https://imgur.com/DqtsRk8) [pictures](https://imgur.com/30uOIdA) that show the HDR problem on an episode of Black Mirror. It's a little hard to tell from the phone photos, but if you look at the skin highlights, you can see how blown out they are, and there is a sickly pink to orange hue that happens in bright lighting on skin tones.

So, when the tech came out, they looked at the problem, saw that it was an issue, and tried some things to try to fix it. As it was still messed up, I called again to Samsung to see if they knew what to do, and they sent the repair shop out a second time. This time they changed out the motherboard - which did not fix the issue. I called a third time, and they sent out the tech again. This time he was on the phone with samsung, and they had the tech do a video chat with Samsung support to show them what the problem is. They determined it was an HDR+ problem and it would need to be turned off when HDR content was played to have the problem go away (even though I showed them this wasn't the case). The TV repair guy was apologetic and said to call Samsung again and let them know it  had not been resolved. 

So I call again, Samsung sends out the same tech a 4th time. He has now been out to my house (which is about 30 miles from his shop) 3 times before, and I know he is frustrated with how things are proceeding, as his hands are tied unless Samsung determines there is a problem to fix. This time, he is on the phone with the rep for about 2 hours with me there giving him information about the problem. 

At the end of this call, the rep determines that there is not an issue with the TV, it must be color settings within the app and Blu Ray player that need to be adjusted to fix the problem. The TV Repair guy had gone through and used his scopes and patterns to tune the TVs colors as much as he could through settings, and it looked great SDR content, but once I put on HDR content, the problem persisted. 

So now that Samsung had again determined that the TV was not the problem, I called again, admittedly frustrated this time. I spoke with a rep and told them as calmly as I could that there WAS a problem, and Samsung either needed to replace the TV, figure out what the problem was an how to fix it, or tell me to kick rocks and I could just not buy Samsung again. This rep checked into it, and said that the only way to start an exchange was to have the TV repair shop come out AGAIN and determine the problem wasn't fixable.

I didn't really have a choice, so I told them this was fine. I waited for a call from the local shop. 3 days. 5 days. A week. Finally, I called them to see when they were going to schedule an appointment and talked to the guy I had been working with. He let me know he was in contact with Samsung to make sure this was the final time he would be sent for the same TV (which I definitely agreed with) and he would get back to me when they confirmed that officially. So I waited. 3 days. 5 days. Another week. 

Finally, Samsung called me and asked if the repair shop had set up a service visit. I said no and told them about him wanting to make sure this is the last time. The Samsung rep said they would reach out and get this process moving. Two more days pass. Same call, Samsung wants to know if I have a service visit set up. Explained it again. Samsung will call them. Two more days, same call. I tell them the service hadn't been set up, and this time the rep says, ""At this point, how about we just cancel the service visit and exchange your TV directly."" VICTORY! I tell him this is great, he has me send in my receipt by email with the serial #, etc. 

I get an email from Samsung a few days later saying that my case is open and a return has been requested for my device - here is the link to track your case. Fantastic, I'll only be reloading this website every 2 hours. Then, cut to this morning. I check the portal to see my case's progress and see [this](https://imgur.com/H8D0oTa). So I call Samsung and they let me know that my return has been denied because the last tech determined that the TV is not defective (it is) so they can't do an exchange. I told the customer service rep this is unacceptable, and he said he can send out another local repair center to look at the tv, but it's hard to override the Samsung techs because they ""know when there is a problem or not"". 

So that's where I'm at. I'm waiting for a 4th repair visit where Samsung will probably determine AGAIN there is no problem, and I will most likely be left with a tv that looks absolutely awful on HDR content. Lesson learned, I will not be purchasing Samsung products in the future after this product and customer service experience. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. I've googled for months and not found any problems like mine, and every fix I've done has not fixed the image. 

Thank you guys for reading my long rant, and buy some other company's TVs!",samsung,2019-01-31 17:52:53

alsu4a,"Now don't get me wrong - the building quality is great.  I did have to contact customer support once, however, because my S7's screen would turn to static randomly. But no problem, they sent a replacement. (Which I know isn't at all everyone's experience)

But the software *sucks*. And I've been realizing this more and more every Android update, and One UI has pushed me over the edge. On top of all the bloatware that came with my S9 out of the box, there were 3 additional applications installed after the update; Yahoo Sports, Yahoo News, and some other (useless) Samsung app. All of which you could uninstall so, no big deal, right? The new app switcher looks nice and all, but the animations are wanky and buggy asf. I only get a nice, smooth animation while exiting an app half of the time, and on top of that the corners suddenly go from squared to curved a noticable amount of time after the animation is over. Also, apps have a habit of jumping to the right side of the screen, than going back to their appropriate size, where they should be. When I click back on the app, the text, for example, appears about an inch below where it's supposed to be, then suddenly jumps to it's correct location. It's noticable and it looks *horrible*. Sure you can flash a ROM, but I don't want to void my warranty in case something does happen  - and you shouldn't have to fix stuff like this bs out of the box, anyways. I'd rather put up with a slider, rumored to be on the One Plus 7, than this for how much I use the front camera. And it's even more tempting to do so when I could trade my S9 in and only have to pay $50 (or less) for a OP7 when it does come out. There's also several other bugs I've noticed while using One UI for under a hour now. Ex: My friend texts me asking if I want to come to his house for the Superbowl. I replied with ""Yeah, I'll see."" I exit the app and get a text notification from ""Preston"" (me) with ""Yeah, I'll see."" I only have myself as a contact under ""my profile"" (which is by default), and this was using Samsung Messages. I waited months since the Android P release for this steaming pile of garbage, so it's not like these bugs are excusable. Samsung's software seems to get worse and worse with every major update. I've always have been more fond of Stock Android, and if the OP7 has wireless charging and a OLED screen (that looks good) I'm going be done in.",samsung,2019-01-31 18:56:05

alweq4,"Intro:

First things first, when I upgraded from my Note8 to the Note9 I've had issues with the procurement process. I normally go through Best Buy Mobile but this time in order to get a \~$400 trade in credit I had to go through Samsung directly which tied to my Verizon account. That said, I had a bunch of issues actually getting the websites to talk to each other and had several phone/emails until finally someone found me a workaround (and apparently a lot of people were having issues). Few weeks later I got an email that the trade in credit was declined for the additional amount (\~$200 difference, if memory serves) and there was nothing they could do about it. So I'm already feeling ripped off/cheated (I have screenshots and all to prove it, worked those up to management teams who approved and then others ultimately declined).

&amp;#x200B;

That's not even the main part...

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I get a generic email from Samsung Customer Support (same team I was working with on above) about my request being received (which I never submitted??). Today I get phone call (Caller ID: Samsung Electronics Canada Inc.) and a gentleman who starts by explaining the reason for his call which went something like this...

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm not sure if you have noticed, but you haven't been getting billed by Verizon lately for your device payments and therefore we haven't been receiving those funds""

I go to look at my Verizon bill and he's correct, I did not see any device installments for the Note9 on recent bills. I hear people in the call center having the same conversation with other customers which aligns with him telling me...

""This is a known issue we're trying to work through with Verizon but the only resolutions are one of two things: 1) Return the device to us and receive a \~$500 credit or 2) pay us the full remaining balance of $500 and keep the device.

So I'm totally caught off guard at this point. The deal when I signed the contract was a monthly installment that would be paid through Verizon which was initially what was going on. I start explaining how I'm not surprised this is the case because we knew early on their systems weren't communicating with one another. I asked what they're doing for customers because this is clearly not an acceptable ask. He said he can offer me the option to keep the freebies (wireless charger and phone case (if I decide to keep the phone)). I begin laughing as does he and he explains he's aware of the obvious insanity of that offer but that's all they're allowed to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ask how I would even go about paying if I wanted to and he made it sound like I would call Verizon, pay the total, and they pay Samsung (this makes no sense, because that's the challenge they said they're having in the first place was getting payment from Verizon). He suggested I call Verizon, confirm the story is legit (and he's not a fraud), and then follow through with them. To which I suggested, he have them call me, we figure out how to get installments working again, and we keep on keeping on, otherwise, not my problem. I also mentioned that I'm not paying anyone other than Verizon because that was not the arrangement. 

They've already breached the original agreement I made from the get-go and now they're asking for in-full payment. I am mind boggled this is happening and also that I couldn't find anything online about this from others yet. 

  
Question, what would you do? Am I in the wrong if I don't call Verizon/Samsung and pay them $500 to even up? Is there any potential this impacts credit scores or anything caused by Samsung? I'd imagine not because I don't have credit or anything setup with them... I feel this is something they should be working with Verizon on. Oh also, I noticed on Verizon's website that I'm eligible for an upgrade which insinuates the device is paid off, so that kind of holds true to his story but also means that as far as Verizon is concerned, I own the device out right...

And I was expecting but hoped wouldn't happen... and in typical Samsung fashion, they've removed this with One UI. UGH!!!! Why do these fuckers keep doing this? The only thing positive I can say at all is that after their silly decision to remove the uninstall button when you hold on an app, it's back, which should never have been removed in the first place.

Devices involved:
- Samsung UE49KS7000U
- PS4 Pro
- AppleTV 4K
- Denon AVR-X1300W

Connections:
- Receiver connected to TV through HDMI ARC
- AppleTV connected to TV through HDMI
- PS4 connected to TV through HDMI

Issue:
When putting the AppleTV to sleep, the TV correctly shuts down, and the receiver correctly shuts down. About 10 seconds passes by and then the receiver suddenly turns on again. Nothing else turns on. Another ~40 seconds passes by and then the receiver shuts down again.

Temporary fix:
Disconnecting the PS4 from the TV.

My thoughts:
I suspect, the PS4 somehow makes the TV switch to the input of the PS4, when no other input is active, which for whichever reason triggers the TV to turn on the receiver. I have no idea what causes the timing of these events though.

HDMI CEC is enabled on all devices. I have tried turning it off in the various combinations available, but nothing solved it. What is particularly puzzling is that the PS4 is turned off - it's not in standby.",samsung,2019-02-02 11:10:08

You make really beautiful phones. I have an S9+ and had an S6 before it. The screens are phenomenal as is the battery on the S9+. Alas I will never be able to buy another Samsung phone again.

Why? Because every 6 months, without asking, you completely change the window manager and install another load of annoying junk that makes my phone a bit more inconvenient to use than it was before.

The One UI update two days ago was particularly unpleasant. The recent apps screen is completely different, Bixby can't be disabled, the notifications are not quite as good as before. I don't know what other nonsense you've loaded on. I was happy. Now I'm less happy.

You obviously have a lot of programmers working for you, so I suggest you ask them about the disaster that was Ubuntu MATE. Sometimes less is more.

I'm sure a lot of people kind of don't care, and some even like all the fluff. But there are also people who just want a vanilla Android phone with a great screen.

Yours sincerely,
An ex-customer.

I just replaced that tv with a new one. I got a 58"" MU6070. I got it because it's larger and supports HDR on all 3 inputs as opposed to one on my older model. 

K have my speaker system hooked up the same way, connected to the optical out on my Tv. Everything plays audio fine and in surround on all my inputs. However this tv has a different remote and I can't seem to find a universal remote option to control volume. If I hit volume up it just shows optical out, bit obviously doesn't change my device volume. Is there anyway to do this?  It's very annoying that this better model doesn't have a very useful function from a lesser one. ",samsung,2019-02-05 04:53:53
anarpz,"I'm in SoCal.  On Saturday there was a flash-flood warning.  I got the typical amber alert tone and message.

Except: I wasn't actually able to view the message without making the default messages app my default app.

So later I turned off the notification in that little drop-down notification window.  Now I would get the Amber alert sound randomly throughout the day but no Notification.

I made messages my default, went to settings, turned off emergency alerts and made Textra my default again.  Still getting amber alert tones.

These are tied to my media volume for some reason, so if I silence my phone they still go off.  I've had at least 5 today.

How do I fix this?",samsung,2019-02-05 05:01:17

anb1k4,"I just got the new android update for my Samsung Galaxy s9+. Before the update, the navigation bar (tabs, back, and home) had a fourth tiny button the locked it in place - and if it was unlocked, the buttons would sink off the screen so they'd be out of the way.

Since the update, that button is gone, and the navigation bar is permanent. This is a problem because it is literally covering things that I need to press or interact with in many apps. Is there any way to fix this?

There is some sort of gesture feature that makes the buttons invisible and you can swipe in their place to go back, home, etc, but I'd rather not be forced to use it.

anc4md,"Just wanted to share in case some other folks encounter the same problem and start frantically googling. 

  
There's an infamous ""moisture detected"" error (associated with a waterdrop icon) that can prevent various Samsung phones from charging. There's a few tips in the wild, including cleaning the port with a q-tip and alcohol, or removing the cache and data of the USB-settings system app. These had not work in my particular case. 

What worked for me was : 

1. turned phone off 
2. cleaned the lint off usb port using the smallest metal pin I could find whilst avoiding the central usb-pin the best I could (I really had to dig deep in there for a good 5 minutes, it's not like it's easy to look down the port)
3. When I was done, tried restarting the phone but it wouldn't. I had to plug it to the charger first, and then start it 
4. The waterdrop icon had finally disappeared 

I honestly don't think using a metal pin was a great idea but it's all I had at hand.  In the meantime, I was able to charge the phone whilst it was turned off. ",samsung,2019-02-05 08:21:02

anjgq5,"I have been a loyal user of the Apple brand since 2011, when I acquired my first 3GS model.  In Brazil, my country, an iPhone today coast more than $ 2000. The minimum salary of the population is almost US $ 272. Calculating these numbers, we need to work 118 days to buy the Cupertino cell phone model.  Each company charges the price you think your product is worth and no one else is forced to buy, correct?  Yes, of course.  


However, since model 6, (today I have a 6S 128GB) I have deeply frustrating problems with the battery. It's just not right to charge my iPhone 2-3 times every day, since I work with it in the streets and constantly need LTE network. It's FRUSTRATING less then ONE HOUR of usage even with more than 90% of battery capacity.  The iOS say that my battery is 84% ​​healthy, but I am sure, that is WRONG. That is FAKE!    


I live in a small town, and different from Samsung and other brands, I do not have an official repair center close to me. I have to travel over 200km to get to the nearest Apple Store (São Paulo) to get repair. That coast a lot, just like my iPhone. Not nice, Apple, not nice ...    


Reading the news, I see Apple director claiming that iPhones sales were hampered by the batteries replaced by the company's program. That is, they assume that the battery is a factor that forces consumers to buy new phones. Unfair and unethical!    


I have AirPods, Apple Watch and iPad. Leaving the iOS platform will be quite radical, but I have no choice. Or rather, I have several others. It is not fair to pay the highest value on a new phone and have the WORST battery on the market. I do not want to believe that they do it for bad intentions, after all, they do not need it, but between doubt, I'd rather not risk it anymore. Money does not grow on trees, nor does my patience.

**TV**: Sony XBR49X800D

**Sound bar**: Samsung HW-MS650

I have encountered an issue where my sound bar is not powering on properly with my TV. Please note, the setup was working fine until about a week ago, so I am a bit perplexed as to what caused this issue.

Typically, I connect the sound bar to the TV via HDMI ARC (on their respective, designated ARC ports). However, when I turn on the TV, the sound bar defaults to ""D.IN"" and does not advance to ""TV ARC"" as it should. My temporary solution was to unplug and re-plug the TV (power reset), at which time the TV will recognize the sound bar via HDMI ARC (and the bar reads ""TV ARC,"" as it should). However, this only works until I power the TV off again. Lately, this no longer seems to temporarily resolve the issue. It simply does not go past ""D.IN"" and no sound emanates from the unit.

The sound bar has been updated recently. My TV's ""sync settings"" that allow HDMI connected devices to power on with the TV are also all enabled. For some reason, the BRAVIA Sync settings main toggle is grayed out, but appeared to be toggled on. (IIRC, it was not grayed out before this issue starting occurring.)

Has anyone encountered anything like this previously? It is frustrating because the entire setup was functioning perfectly well until last weekend.

Thank you in advance for your insight.

Lo and behold, it has now been a month since Samsung released the Pie / One UI update, and amazingly, it seems all the carrier devices have received updates.

I recently had to reset my Galaxy Watch, at which point I discovered that the Samsung Health data doesn't get sync'd from your phone to the watch when you re-pair. Not only that, but my step data was now out of sync (the watch showing a different # than the Health app on my phone). So I reset the storage &amp; cache on the Health Android app, which got things back in sync as far as steps, but all my sleep data and previous step data is gone. Turns out that Samsung Health will not sync this data to your Samsung account, despite there being a ""Sync Now"" option in the app, which always responds with ""Service unavailable. Try later.""

aoqx2j,"Well, I did some tests today, the Note 9 is just as bad as when I first bought it. This, along with the s8 plus Exynos (not sure about the s9 plus as I haven't used it) are some of the absolute worst optimized phones I've ever used.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have 2 other high end samsung devices both of which if we ignore loading times COMPLETELY outperform this pile of junk. These devices are an S8 Snapdragon (NOT plus) and Tab S4 Snapdragon tablet. 

&amp;#x200B;

The scrolling in online apps on this phone is downright AWFUL (this also refers to the s8 plus Exynos. If you're wondering what the story with the S8 plus is and why don't have it, I bought it prior to the note cuz I wanted a bigger screen which I returned because I thought it was faulty and bought the note, both brand new. S8 Plus was from amazon, note 9 was from an official local phone store)

First and foremost, the scrolling itself is way too fast, sensitive and the acceleration is downright horrible. You barely touch the screen and it goes flying. Second of all, the way content is loaded is absolutely ridiculous. With almost every app that I tested it on, there were always elements whose frames or placeholders DID NOT load up prior to me reaching them when I start scrolling resulting in jitter when they did load up. Both, my tab s4 and my s8 loaded everything's frames and exact place holders with most apps prior to reaching them. So when I start scrolling it resulted in a much smoother experience with minimal jitter 

Also the note 9 had LOWER fps than both the s8 and tab s4 when loading up certain apps such as twitter and google playstore and scrolling down at medium speed immediately. Some games also loaded slower on the note 9 as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The apps I tested today were:

*\*\*\* The test was simply open the app, quickly go to its most overloaded page and start scrolling down at a slow - medium rate (loading the apps is ignored because the note 9 wins all of them)*

**Twitter Trending / Search page** \- Note 9 - lowest FPS most jitter

**Playstore home page** \- Note 9 - lowest FPS most jitter

**Netflix home page** \- Note 9 lowest fps, S8 most jitter

**Google Chrome wwe, paypal, google search and a few others** \- worst overall performance on the Note 9

**Samsung Browser** \- best performance on the note 9 (pretty much one of the only things that loads up faster and performs faster)

**Prime Video** \- lowest FPS on tab s4, most jitter on tab s4

**Reddit Trending page** \- lowest FPS on note 9, most jitter on note 9

&amp;#x200B;

I patiently waited for the One UI update just to see if they were going to fix this stupidity but it seems that it never will be. The note 9 and the S8 plus Exynoss have something at their core, whether its their drivers or whatever, it doesn't really matter. Instead of working on a skin for brand new UI, maybe Samsung should actually focus on their hardware and actually test their stuff, not in the way all those clueless phone VS phone youtubers do where they only test the most general stuff - mostly loading times, cameras and battery life. To someone who doesnt own other high end devices this will not be an issue at all or something they notice but to me it is a huge issue. It is not logical or acceptable for a phone that cost me about 50% more than the s8 (when I first bought it) and tab s4 to be performing worse with ANYTHING. It is acceptable for it to be even equal. It should be noticeably faster, smoother etc. with absolutely everything and there is not a single excuse other than absolute laziness, classlessness and lack of knowledge and experience of these so-called developers. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am getting rid of this piece of trash and most likely never purchasing another note or plus phone made by samsung. I'd rather stick with the s8 with the smaller display and no spen rather than wanting to stab myself every time I'm holding my phone.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't care what anyone has to say either. This is not bad luck, I've tested other Note 9s, I gave Samsung time and they didn't change a thing. In fact Android Pie I believe has made the phones slower if anything. I really don't give a single F about battery life. Unless you can offer me butter smoother performance I can care less if you're battery lasts a week. And I wouldnt be surprised if this thing Im complaining about is not getting fixed simply to ensure that the plus models and notes get noticeably more battery than the default models.

I've been using Samsung notes on my Tab S3 and I really like it so far. However, I honestly don't know what is to come in the Samsung Notes pipeline, so I wanted to post a few questions here. Currently I am using 3.0.1.8.

1. ***Will Samsung Notes have a vector engine?*** Currently, there is a raster engine, and therefore you cannot really zoom in anywhere. I was wondering if they have any plans to convert the raster engine into a vector engine. It would also be great to be able to zoom into places.
2. ***Will it ever support Notes Playback?*** One thing that I really like about Notability on the iPad pro is that you have the ability to write down stuff, while at the same time be able to record your voice. This is really quite interesting because essentially, you can record yourself learning something new. Is this in the works, or is there any plan to introduce this in later versions.
3. ***Can I change the background color?*** I'd really love to be able to change the background of the pages in Samsung Notes. Is this going to be ever possible? Is this a part of their backlog?
4. ***Infinite Canvas support?*** I understand that there is a lot of wisdom in having a fixed width page, but it would be nice to be able to create something on an infinite canvas, especially when drawing a mind-map. I am right now using Sketchbook pro to draw things, and then import them into Samsung Notes, but its not the best way to go about things.
5. ***View Notes Online?*** I would really like to be able to share notes with other people who do not have Samsung Notes. This is a real problem for me right now, because I keep having to share PDFs, that get cut in the middle of nowhere.",samsung,2019-02-09 15:38:34

And after a couple years with the iPhone 6, I decided to come back home to good ole Android. I got the S9 a few months ago and, while I do love it, there are a couple of things about it that really bug me. The main issue I have with it is that there's a limit to how many notifications it will show you at any given time. Once you reach the maximum number of notifications you won't see any new notifications added to the list until you clear it. Otherwise no new notifications will show. You'll hear them come in but you won't see them. In iOS this problem doesn't exist. You can have an infinite amount of notifications to scroll thru without ever clearing them out and the latest notification will ALWAYS show up at the top of the list. Furthermore, it organizes the notifications by date and timestamp, so you never have to wonder when a given notification came in. 

This is extremely aggravating because now I have to constantly be clearing the notification list to be sure I'm not missing any important texts or alerts. There has to be a way around this, but none of my research has turned up an answer yet. Reddit is my last resort. Does anybody know anything about this?

But, my main issue now is that i frequently move photos and music between my phone and my computer, but now I cant do that. Either the phone will connect and disconnect from the computer over and over when plugged in, or it will stay connected, and i can view the files, but it wont let me transfer anything to or from the phone (It will show the ""copying files"" window when i try to do it, but it will just stay there and not do anything).

Right now, I have the Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime in which I've had for four years now (my mom and sis have upgraded to new phones twice now while I've had the same one during that period). It is having a good run but I'm dying to have a new phone right now and I wanna upgrade to possibly the newest Samsung Galaxy flagship out there.

Right now, its the S9 and S9+ that currently exists even though an S10 is forthcoming. I wanna ask those who currently have the S9 or S9+ now if its even worth it? I've always had a lower-budget phone, mainly because it was my mom or someone in my family who would be paying for it. However, I'll be paying for my next phone (thanks to hard work at my job) and I'm looking to spend big bucks for an awesome phone and I'm looking to buy unlocked too since I'm with Metro by T-Mobile.

I decided to just restart the phone, and of course that fixed the problem. I thought maybe it was just a one off, but I was wrong. Now it has happened two more different times today. I can't figure out why this is happening. I even installed Malwarebytes because I thought maybe my device was somehow compromised, if that is even possible.

\+Early January - it stopped charging wirelessly. Samsung sent me to a local authorized tech

\+Mid-January - I spend 4 hours in authorized tech shop, they replace wireless charging module, wired charger port, and battery. Wireless charging still doesn't work. Additionally, fast charging no longer works wired  
\+Same day - I call Samsung, after much bickering, they agree to mail me a new phone. They will hold money on my credit card. Once I receive the phone, I mail mine in. When they receive mine, hold released. Cool.

\+One week later - no phone. I call Samsung. They tell me to hang tight and wait  
\+Two weeks later - no phone, I call again. They apologize and agree, new phone on the way, credit card hold, etc.  
\+Last Wednesday - I email support. No response  
\+Last Friday - I contact BBB  
\+Today - they call me. They will not send me a new phone, rather, I have to mail mine to them to give them a chance to fix it. I need to be without a phone for 7-10 days. They say if I need a phone, I can go to Verizon and ask them if they would maybe lend me one. Even if Verizon would do this, why should they be responsible? They did nothing wrong. Additionally, shouldn't Samsung take care of arranging a loaner phone for me? 

Look, I'm no better than anybody else, but asking someone to be without a phone for 7-10 days is asinine. What a horrible warranty program this is. I can't get anywhere with them. I attempted to return the phone (I bought it directly from Samsung), but they said I'm outside of the return date (the date I originally reported the problem, I believe I was still within the return range). 

Bottom line - they won't let me return it. Their local authorized techs admitted it can't be fixed and recommended to Samsung to replace it. Samsung now says they need to diagnose on their own and I need to be without a phone while this happens.

I was just wondering if anyone knew the reason for this as they are both 4K outputs. HDR on the pro also seems to make the picture darker than HDR on the smart tv apps. This was the only reasoning I could come up with and maybe the HDR directly on the Tv is a later version. Not sure but wondering if anyone would have an answer for this ,samsung,2019-02-12 21:09:38

aq89wb,"I've got a Samsung Smart TV and have had other Samsung TVs in the past. Back in 2010 my 46 inch TV from Samsung lost all sound capabilities. I Googled and found out that this was because my TV needed an update and I needed to run a f***ing ethernet cable to my living room. 

Fast forward to 2019 and my 2 month old smart TV suddenly has no sound from my PS4. I had about 20 minutes to play before work so I was bummed and checked for updates (I have my TV set to auto update). What do you know there's an update. I update, it takes 15 minutes and I have to leave.

My question is why the hell is this still an issue on a brand new Smart TV. Samsung is one of the biggest, most expensive, and one of the most premium brands of TV out there today. If I was one of parents in my 50s and didn't know much about these newer TVs I'd think it was defective and would have tried to claim a warranty. Or worse if it was out of warranty most older people would be buying a new TV over a simple software update.

als4on,"Hey guys, long post incoming. If anyone has advice for how to get this problem resolved I would love to here it because I am beyond frustrated at this point. 

So about a year ago, I purchased a UN75MU6070 4k Tv. I was planning on waiting to get a better version, but the timing ended up being right and the price looked great (I was wrong on that). The first time I turned on the TV, everything looked great. I didn't have any 4k content to play on it yet, but Netflix shows and upscaled blu-rays looked awesome and I was very happy. A couple months later, my wife bought me a 4k Blu Ray player, and I purchased my first 4k BluRay. 

Now I don't know that this TV has what is called ""true HDR"", but it does have an approximation that makes colors richer. However, when I would watch a movie with HDR, the colors looked...off. In the highlights, everything looked too washed out, and in the shadows, everything looked flat and like it had no contrast. [Here](https://imgur.com/KBuwzik) are [some](https://imgur.com/XuarVkW) [comparison](https://imgur.com/8RfgrEL) shots. I know it's hard to tell from a phone picture, but you can see that the colors, brightness and contrast are very messed up when you see how the eye looks between HDR and SDR. 

I submitted a request for assistance and the rep had me update my firmware: this didn't change anything. Next, I called again, and the rep told me that the problem was HDR+. Even though the description on the setting itself says it automatically determines if HDR content is displaying and turns itself on or off, I took this as a possible solution. Turning it off did nothing to fix the problems.

I called a couple more times and talked to reps that tried to help but were unable to, until they finally sent out a local repair tech to look at the tv. By this point, I had gotten 4k netflix, and I could see the same problem with HDR content from that app, so I knew that this wasn't a Blu Ray player problem, it was a TV problem. Here are a [couple](https://imgur.com/DqtsRk8) [pictures](https://imgur.com/30uOIdA) that show the HDR problem on an episode of Black Mirror. It's a little hard to tell from the phone photos, but if you look at the skin highlights, you can see how blown out they are, and there is a sickly pink to orange hue that happens in bright lighting on skin tones.

So, when the tech came out, they looked at the problem, saw that it was an issue, and tried some things to try to fix it. As it was still messed up, I called again to Samsung to see if they knew what to do, and they sent the repair shop out a second time. This time they changed out the motherboard - which did not fix the issue. I called a third time, and they sent out the tech again. This time he was on the phone with samsung, and they had the tech do a video chat with Samsung support to show them what the problem is. They determined it was an HDR+ problem and it would need to be turned off when HDR content was played to have the problem go away (even though I showed them this wasn't the case). The TV repair guy was apologetic and said to call Samsung again and let them know it  had not been resolved. 

So I call again, Samsung sends out the same tech a 4th time. He has now been out to my house (which is about 30 miles from his shop) 3 times before, and I know he is frustrated with how things are proceeding, as his hands are tied unless Samsung determines there is a problem to fix. This time, he is on the phone with the rep for about 2 hours with me there giving him information about the problem. 

At the end of this call, the rep determines that there is not an issue with the TV, it must be color settings within the app and Blu Ray player that need to be adjusted to fix the problem. The TV Repair guy had gone through and used his scopes and patterns to tune the TVs colors as much as he could through settings, and it looked great SDR content, but once I put on HDR content, the problem persisted. 

So now that Samsung had again determined that the TV was not the problem, I called again, admittedly frustrated this time. I spoke with a rep and told them as calmly as I could that there WAS a problem, and Samsung either needed to replace the TV, figure out what the problem was an how to fix it, or tell me to kick rocks and I could just not buy Samsung again. This rep checked into it, and said that the only way to start an exchange was to have the TV repair shop come out AGAIN and determine the problem wasn't fixable.

I didn't really have a choice, so I told them this was fine. I waited for a call from the local shop. 3 days. 5 days. A week. Finally, I called them to see when they were going to schedule an appointment and talked to the guy I had been working with. He let me know he was in contact with Samsung to make sure this was the final time he would be sent for the same TV (which I definitely agreed with) and he would get back to me when they confirmed that officially. So I waited. 3 days. 5 days. Another week. 

Finally, Samsung called me and asked if the repair shop had set up a service visit. I said no and told them about him wanting to make sure this is the last time. The Samsung rep said they would reach out and get this process moving. Two more days pass. Same call, Samsung wants to know if I have a service visit set up. Explained it again. Samsung will call them. Two more days, same call. I tell them the service hadn't been set up, and this time the rep says, ""At this point, how about we just cancel the service visit and exchange your TV directly."" VICTORY! I tell him this is great, he has me send in my receipt by email with the serial #, etc. 

I get an email from Samsung a few days later saying that my case is open and a return has been requested for my device - here is the link to track your case. Fantastic, I'll only be reloading this website every 2 hours. Then, cut to this morning. I check the portal to see my case's progress and see [this](https://imgur.com/H8D0oTa). So I call Samsung and they let me know that my return has been denied because the last tech determined that the TV is not defective (it is) so they can't do an exchange. I told the customer service rep this is unacceptable, and he said he can send out another local repair center to look at the tv, but it's hard to override the Samsung techs because they ""know when there is a problem or not"". 

So that's where I'm at. I'm waiting for a 4th repair visit where Samsung will probably determine AGAIN there is no problem, and I will most likely be left with a tv that looks absolutely awful on HDR content. Lesson learned, I will not be purchasing Samsung products in the future after this product and customer service experience. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. I've googled for months and not found any problems like mine, and every fix I've done has not fixed the image.

But the software *sucks*. And I've been realizing this more and more every Android update, and One UI has pushed me over the edge. On top of all the bloatware that came with my S9 out of the box, there were 3 additional applications installed after the update; Yahoo Sports, Yahoo News, and some other (useless) Samsung app. All of which you could uninstall so, no big deal, right? The new app switcher looks nice and all, but the animations are wanky and buggy asf. I only get a nice, smooth animation while exiting an app half of the time, and on top of that the corners suddenly go from squared to curved a noticable amount of time after the animation is over. Also, apps have a habit of jumping to the right side of the screen, than going back to their appropriate size, where they should be. When I click back on the app, the text, for example, appears about an inch below where it's supposed to be, then suddenly jumps to it's correct location. It's noticable and it looks *horrible*. Sure you can flash a ROM, but I don't want to void my warranty in case something does happen  - and you shouldn't have to fix stuff like this bs out of the box, anyways. I'd rather put up with a slider, rumored to be on the One Plus 7, than this for how much I use the front camera. And it's even more tempting to do so when I could trade my S9 in and only have to pay $50 (or less) for a OP7 when it does come out. There's also several other bugs I've noticed while using One UI for under a hour now. Ex: My friend texts me asking if I want to come to his house for the Superbowl. I replied with ""Yeah, I'll see."" I exit the app and get a text notification from ""Preston"" (me) with ""Yeah, I'll see."" I only have myself as a contact under ""my profile"" (which is by default), and this was using Samsung Messages. I waited months since the Android P release for this steaming pile of garbage, so it's not like these bugs are excusable. Samsung's software seems to get worse and worse with every major update. I've always have been more fond of Stock Android, and if the OP7 has wireless charging and a OLED screen (that looks good) I'm going be done in.",samsung,2019-01-31 18:56:05

alweq4,"Intro:

First things first, when I upgraded from my Note8 to the Note9 I've had issues with the procurement process. I normally go through Best Buy Mobile but this time in order to get a \~$400 trade in credit I had to go through Samsung directly which tied to my Verizon account. That said, I had a bunch of issues actually getting the websites to talk to each other and had several phone/emails until finally someone found me a workaround (and apparently a lot of people were having issues). Few weeks later I got an email that the trade in credit was declined for the additional amount (\~$200 difference, if memory serves) and there was nothing they could do about it. So I'm already feeling ripped off/cheated (I have screenshots and all to prove it, worked those up to management teams who approved and then others ultimately declined).

&amp;#x200B;

That's not even the main part...

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I get a generic email from Samsung Customer Support (same team I was working with on above) about my request being received (which I never submitted??). Today I get phone call (Caller ID: Samsung Electronics Canada Inc.) and a gentleman who starts by explaining the reason for his call which went something like this...

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm not sure if you have noticed, but you haven't been getting billed by Verizon lately for your device payments and therefore we haven't been receiving those funds""

I go to look at my Verizon bill and he's correct, I did not see any device installments for the Note9 on recent bills. I hear people in the call center having the same conversation with other customers which aligns with him telling me...

""This is a known issue we're trying to work through with Verizon but the only resolutions are one of two things: 1) Return the device to us and receive a \~$500 credit or 2) pay us the full remaining balance of $500 and keep the device.

So I'm totally caught off guard at this point. The deal when I signed the contract was a monthly installment that would be paid through Verizon which was initially what was going on. I start explaining how I'm not surprised this is the case because we knew early on their systems weren't communicating with one another. I asked what they're doing for customers because this is clearly not an acceptable ask. He said he can offer me the option to keep the freebies (wireless charger and phone case (if I decide to keep the phone)). I begin laughing as does he and he explains he's aware of the obvious insanity of that offer but that's all they're allowed to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ask how I would even go about paying if I wanted to and he made it sound like I would call Verizon, pay the total, and they pay Samsung (this makes no sense, because that's the challenge they said they're having in the first place was getting payment from Verizon). He suggested I call Verizon, confirm the story is legit (and he's not a fraud), and then follow through with them. To which I suggested, he have them call me, we figure out how to get installments working again, and we keep on keeping on, otherwise, not my problem. I also mentioned that I'm not paying anyone other than Verizon because that was not the arrangement. 

They've already breached the original agreement I made from the get-go and now they're asking for in-full payment. I am mind boggled this is happening and also that I couldn't find anything online about this from others yet. 

  
Question, what would you do? Am I in the wrong if I don't call Verizon/Samsung and pay them $500 to even up? Is there any potential this impacts credit scores or anything caused by Samsung? I'd imagine not because I don't have credit or anything setup with them... I feel this is something they should be working with Verizon on. Oh also, I noticed on Verizon's website that I'm eligible for an upgrade which insinuates the device is paid off, so that kind of holds true to his story but also means that as far as Verizon is concerned, I own the device out right...

You make really beautiful phones. I have an S9+ and had an S6 before it. The screens are phenomenal as is the battery on the S9+. Alas I will never be able to buy another Samsung phone again.

Why? Because every 6 months, without asking, you completely change the window manager and install another load of annoying junk that makes my phone a bit more inconvenient to use than it was before.

The One UI update two days ago was particularly unpleasant. The recent apps screen is completely different, Bixby can't be disabled, the notifications are not quite as good as before. I don't know what other nonsense you've loaded on. I was happy. Now I'm less happy.

You obviously have a lot of programmers working for you, so I suggest you ask them about the disaster that was Ubuntu MATE. Sometimes less is more.

I'm sure a lot of people kind of don't care, and some even like all the fluff. But there are also people who just want a vanilla Android phone with a great screen.

Hopefully this is the right place to post this or perhaps someone can relate to the issue I'm having.

I have contacted my network provided and they advised a soft reset and reset the network settings. I done this and the issue still persists, so they said the issue must be with the phone. 

The phone was purchased in October 2018 and has not been damaged in any way i.e dropped on a hard surface or in water.

I have made sure that all apps are up to date and the same with the latest software update.

There's an infamous ""moisture detected"" error (associated with a waterdrop icon) that can prevent various Samsung phones from charging.

1. turned phone off 
2. cleaned the lint off usb port using the smallest metal pin I could find whilst avoiding the central usb-pin the best I could (I really had to dig deep in there for a good 5 minutes, it's not like it's easy to look down the port)

The minimum salary of the population is almost US $ 272. Calculating these numbers, we need to work 118 days to buy the Cupertino cell phone model.  Each company charges the price you think your product is worth and no one else is forced to buy, correct?  Yes, of course.  


However, since model 6, (today I have a 6S 128GB) I have deeply frustrating problems with the battery. It's just not right to charge my iPhone 2-3 times every day, since I work with it in the streets and constantly need LTE network. It's FRUSTRATING less then ONE HOUR of usage even with more than 90% of battery capacity.  The iOS say that my battery is 84% ​​healthy, but I am sure, that is WRONG. That is FAKE!    


I live in a small town, and different from Samsung and other brands, I do not have an official repair center close to me. I have to travel over 200km to get to the nearest Apple Store (São Paulo) to get repair. That coast a lot, just like my iPhone. Not nice, Apple, not nice ...    


Reading the news, I see Apple director claiming that iPhones sales were hampered by the batteries replaced by the company's program. That is, they assume that the battery is a factor that forces consumers to buy new phones. Unfair and unethical!

**TV**: Sony XBR49X800D

**Sound bar**: Samsung HW-MS650

I have encountered an issue where my sound bar is not powering on properly with my TV. Please note, the setup was working fine until about a week ago, so I am a bit perplexed as to what caused this issue.

Typically, I connect the sound bar to the TV via HDMI ARC (on their respective, designated ARC ports). However, when I turn on the TV, the sound bar defaults to ""D.IN"" and does not advance to ""TV ARC"" as it should. My temporary solution was to unplug and re-plug the TV (power reset), at which time the TV will recognize the sound bar via HDMI ARC (and the bar reads ""TV ARC,"" as it should). However, this only works until I power the TV off again. Lately, this no longer seems to temporarily resolve the issue. It simply does not go past ""D.IN"" and no sound emanates from the unit.

The sound bar has been updated recently. My TV's ""sync settings"" that allow HDMI connected devices to power on with the TV are also all enabled. For some reason, the BRAVIA Sync settings main toggle is grayed out, but appeared to be toggled on. (IIRC, it was not grayed out before this issue starting occurring.)

Has anyone encountered anything like this previously? It is frustrating because the entire setup was functioning perfectly well until last weekend.

Thank you in advance for your insight.

*Inputs/outputs*
* HDMI ARC out from sound bar to to HDMI ARC on TV

* Enable HDMI CEC on the sound bar (suggested by Sony support - not sure how to do this)

I have multiple email addresses set up, most notably my personal and work address. I forward every work email to my personal gmail inbox.

I have left everything as it was out of the box, so I haven't swapped out any cables or anything. Only switching outlets which hasn't done anything.

It still works, it just charges at regular speed. My phone says ""charging wirelessly"" now any time I put it on there. I googled and couldn't find too much about the issue so I'm wondering if anybody here has had a similar experience or knows how to fix it.

aoqx2j,"Well, I did some tests today, the Note 9 is just as bad as when I first bought it. This, along with the s8 plus Exynos (not sure about the s9 plus as I haven't used it) are some of the absolute worst optimized phones I've ever used.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have 2 other high end samsung devices both of which if we ignore loading times COMPLETELY outperform this pile of junk. These devices are an S8 Snapdragon (NOT plus) and Tab S4 Snapdragon tablet. 

&amp;#x200B;

The scrolling in online apps on this phone is downright AWFUL (this also refers to the s8 plus Exynos. If you're wondering what the story with the S8 plus is and why don't have it, I bought it prior to the note cuz I wanted a bigger screen which I returned because I thought it was faulty and bought the note, both brand new. S8 Plus was from amazon, note 9 was from an official local phone store)

First and foremost, the scrolling itself is way too fast, sensitive and the acceleration is downright horrible. You barely touch the screen and it goes flying. Second of all, the way content is loaded is absolutely ridiculous. With almost every app that I tested it on, there were always elements whose frames or placeholders DID NOT load up prior to me reaching them when I start scrolling resulting in jitter when they did load up. Both, my tab s4 and my s8 loaded everything's frames and exact place holders with most apps prior to reaching them. So when I start scrolling it resulted in a much smoother experience with minimal jitter 

Also the note 9 had LOWER fps than both the s8 and tab s4 when loading up certain apps such as twitter and google playstore and scrolling down at medium speed immediately. Some games also loaded slower on the note 9 as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The apps I tested today were:

*\*\*\* The test was simply open the app, quickly go to its most overloaded page and start scrolling down at a slow - medium rate (loading the apps is ignored because the note 9 wins all of them)*

**Twitter Trending / Search page** \- Note 9 - lowest FPS most jitter

**Playstore home page** \- Note 9 - lowest FPS most jitter

**Netflix home page** \- Note 9 lowest fps, S8 most jitter

**Google Chrome wwe, paypal, google search and a few others** \- worst overall performance on the Note 9

**Samsung Browser** \- best performance on the note 9 (pretty much one of the only things that loads up faster and performs faster)

**Prime Video** \- lowest FPS on tab s4, most jitter on tab s4

**Reddit Trending page** \- lowest FPS on note 9, most jitter on note 9

&amp;#x200B;

I patiently waited for the One UI update just to see if they were going to fix this stupidity but it seems that it never will be. The note 9 and the S8 plus Exynoss have something at their core, whether its their drivers or whatever, it doesn't really matter. Instead of working on a skin for brand new UI, maybe Samsung should actually focus on their hardware and actually test their stuff, not in the way all those clueless phone VS phone youtubers do where they only test the most general stuff - mostly loading times, cameras and battery life. To someone who doesnt own other high end devices this will not be an issue at all or something they notice but to me it is a huge issue. It is not logical or acceptable for a phone that cost me about 50% more than the s8 (when I first bought it) and tab s4 to be performing worse with ANYTHING. It is acceptable for it to be even equal. It should be noticeably faster, smoother etc. with absolutely everything and there is not a single excuse other than absolute laziness, classlessness and lack of knowledge and experience of these so-called developers. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am getting rid of this piece of trash and most likely never purchasing another note or plus phone made by samsung. I'd rather stick with the s8 with the smaller display and no spen rather than wanting to stab myself every time I'm holding my phone.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't care what anyone has to say either. This is not bad luck, I've tested other Note 9s, I gave Samsung time and they didn't change a thing. In fact Android Pie I believe has made the phones slower if anything. I really don't give a single F about battery life. Unless you can offer me butter smoother performance I can care less if you're battery lasts a week. And I wouldnt be surprised if this thing Im complaining about is not getting fixed simply to ensure that the plus models and notes get noticeably more battery than the default models.

I've been using Samsung notes on my Tab S3 and I really like it so far. However, I honestly don't know what is to come in the Samsung Notes pipeline, so I wanted to post a few questions here. Currently I am using 3.0.1.8.

1. ***Will Samsung Notes have a vector engine?*** Currently, there is a raster engine, and therefore you cannot really zoom in anywhere. I was wondering if they have any plans to convert the raster engine into a vector engine. It would also be great to be able to zoom into places.
2. ***Will it ever support Notes Playback?*** One thing that I really like about Notability on the iPad pro is that you have the ability to write down stuff, while at the same time be able to record your voice. This is really quite interesting because essentially, you can record yourself learning something new. Is this in the works, or is there any plan to introduce this in later versions.
3. ***Can I change the background color?*** I'd really love to be able to change the background of the pages in Samsung Notes. Is this going to be ever possible? Is this a part of their backlog?
4. ***Infinite Canvas support?*** I understand that there is a lot of wisdom in having a fixed width page, but it would be nice to be able to create something on an infinite canvas, especially when drawing a mind-map. I am right now using Sketchbook pro to draw things, and then import them into Samsung Notes, but its not the best way to go about things.
5. ***View Notes Online?*** I would really like to be able to share notes with other people who do not have Samsung Notes. This is a real problem for me right now, because I keep having to share PDFs, that get cut in the middle of nowhere.",samsung,2019-02-09 15:38:34

And after a couple years with the iPhone 6, I decided to come back home to good ole Android. I got the S9 a few months ago and, while I do love it, there are a couple of things about it that really bug me. The main issue I have with it is that there's a limit to how many notifications it will show you at any given time. Once you reach the maximum number of notifications you won't see any new notifications added to the list until you clear it. Otherwise no new notifications will show. You'll hear them come in but you won't see them. In iOS this problem doesn't exist. You can have an infinite amount of notifications to scroll thru without ever clearing them out and the latest notification will ALWAYS show up at the top of the list. Furthermore, it organizes the notifications by date and timestamp, so you never have to wonder when a given notification came in. 

This is extremely aggravating because now I have to constantly be clearing the notification list to be sure I'm not missing any important texts or alerts. There has to be a way around this, but none of my research has turned up an answer yet. Reddit is my last resort. Does anybody know anything about this?

\+Early January - it stopped charging wirelessly. Samsung sent me to a local authorized tech

\+Mid-January - I spend 4 hours in authorized tech shop, they replace wireless charging module, wired charger port, and battery. Wireless charging still doesn't work. Additionally, fast charging no longer works wired  
\+Same day - I call Samsung, after much bickering, they agree to mail me a new phone. They will hold money on my credit card. Once I receive the phone, I mail mine in. When they receive mine, hold released. Cool.

\+One week later - no phone. I call Samsung. They tell me to hang tight and wait  
\+Two weeks later - no phone, I call again. They apologize and agree, new phone on the way, credit card hold, etc.  
\+Last Wednesday - I email support. No response  
\+Last Friday - I contact BBB  
\+Today - they call me. They will not send me a new phone, rather, I have to mail mine to them to give them a chance to fix it. I need to be without a phone for 7-10 days. They say if I need a phone, I can go to Verizon and ask them if they would maybe lend me one. Even if Verizon would do this, why should they be responsible? They did nothing wrong. Additionally, shouldn't Samsung take care of arranging a loaner phone for me? 

Look, I'm no better than anybody else, but asking someone to be without a phone for 7-10 days is asinine. What a horrible warranty program this is. I can't get anywhere with them. I attempted to return the phone (I bought it directly from Samsung), but they said I'm outside of the return date (the date I originally reported the problem, I believe I was still within the return range). 

Bottom line - they won't let me return it. Their local authorized techs admitted it can't be fixed and recommended to Samsung to replace it. Samsung now says they need to diagnose on their own and I need to be without a phone while this happens.

Fast forward to 2019 and my 2 month old smart TV suddenly has no sound from my PS4. I had about 20 minutes to play before work so I was bummed and checked for updates (I have my TV set to auto update). What do you know there's an update. I update, it takes 15 minutes and I have to leave.

Battery life and music are important to me, as I use spotify all the time and I don't want to charge it constantly.  I’ve thought that the Samsung galaxy watch looked wonderful, but am a little nervous with it not using WearOS, Google Pay, and the google apps store.  I am unsure how this will correlate to performance on my android device and whether I would need a Samsung phone to get the full utility out of it.  Does the limited apps make a difference?  Or is everything that's practical already in the Samsung store?  I have also heard the Bixby is terrible, so can any comment on their experience with it?  I am currently just looking into the Galaxy watch and TicWatch Pro but am open to other options and willing to spend up to $350.  What do you think is best?",samsung,2019-02-14 02:53:19

Mum takes away the iPad and puts a Tab S4 with keyboard and mouse in front of him and says:

Well, a computer is a device that allows you to:

* Connect a mouse because ""we really feel that the ergonomics ... are that your hands are rested on a surface, and that lifting your arm up to poke a screen is a pretty fatiguing thing to do.""
* Plug in a USB drive to copy any files you want on and off.
* Set your favourite apps as default for different tasks like web browsing, e-mail, and playing music and videos.
* Run multiple apps in resizable windows in desktop mode.
* Multitask with any apps you want running in the background.
* Manage files and directly share any files between any apps on the device.
* Download documents and zip files from any website and extract and edit them with your favourite apps. Then zip them up again for further sharing.
* Have multiple user accounts so you can safely share your device with your family members while keeping your own information private.

Teenage boy says ""Wow, that's much better than what I was using before, thanks Mum!""

aqi9c4,"I would probably pre order galaxy S10, now they offer a trade in value of $300 for my S8 which sounds like too good to be true. 

And Samsung trade in program does not have a good reputation, many people call it a scam where they only got $25 as the trade in credit when they send the functional phone. But I noticed that most of these complaints are posted more than one year ago when people try to get a new S8 and Note 8, so is the situation gets better now? 

Or everyone just stop trading in their devices through the official website. 

To be honest, most time when I want to trade in something, the first choice is usually this Original sellers. Had some trade in with Apple before for an iPad, offer is relatively lower compared to the market price, but I got the final price for what was offered, besides there is trade in kit to save me some time on this. So overall great trade in experience. 

But such a large amount of negative comments on Samsung's trade in program really got me concerned. 

So if you have traded in with Samsung recently ? Can you share about what is offered and what is the final price ?",samsung,2019-02-14 10:06:35

Paying with Apple, fitbit and others are available in Denmark, and now Google pay has also arived. 

Is it really true that Google pay is not compatible with wear? Its android based, so why not let it work on wear since Samsung phones is also on android?

I hate to admit it, but Im really starting to give up on Samsung Pay, and could start looking at fitbit or an android watch instead of upgrading my S2 to the S3.

So, is there any rumors on Google pay on Wear watches any time soon ?",samsung,2019-02-14 16:32:18

Sometimes, when in art mode, instead of just going off when there's no motion, it turns to a black screensaver screen with the samsung logo in white bouncing around. It doesn't happen always, and using the remote will kick it back into art mode or TV mode.. but what gives?

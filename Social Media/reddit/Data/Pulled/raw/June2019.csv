I have gone all in with Samsung, and currently have an S10. I purchased the Dex pad, but wanted to know all of your opinions regarding it.

I am disappointed that I can only single screen on it as it has 1 HDMI port. Is there a better alternative that you use? Any recommendations for dual screen or different hubs?

Why is samsung so behind on its fast charging technology?   Not trying to hate or anything just genuinely wondering why they wouldnt adopt 21 W charging with a snapdragon processor thats been capable of it since 2015.

bvfj9g,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

So I've had my Galaxy S8 since it launched and have been extremely happy with it. I have had Samsung phones since the S2 and have always loved them. Problem is my battery life is really poor now that I've been using it for 2 years, plus I have a small yet deep corner crack in the screen glass that could easily damage the display if it gets worse. Bottom line is I'm looking for an upgrade and I have always wanted a Note. Looking on Ebay, I could get the Note 8 in open box/new condition for around [$350](https://www.ebay.com/itm/New-Samsung-Note-8-64GB-Unlocked-AT-T-Verizon-T-Mobile-Straight-Talk-Metropcs/123752966100?epid=8025407723&amp;hash=item1cd04067d4%3Am%3Am4vcp0xizwUMpiCyAfa9OLQ&amp;LH_ItemCondition=1500%7C1000)  or I could get a Note 9 in the same condition for [$550](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-9-SM-N960F-DS-128GB-FACTORY-UNLOCKED-6-4-DUAL-SIM/142895344603?epid=16029493163&amp;hash=item214539ebdb%3Am%3AmcEH7AAnZQx_9FBix8OEYXA&amp;LH_ItemCondition=1000%7C1500). 

&amp;#x200B;

Is the Note 9 worth the extra $200? The biggest difference for me at least is the bigger battery. Its one of the main reasons I'm looking to upgrade from my old S8 but the 17% increase from Note 8's 3,300 mAh to the Note 9's 4,000 mAh doesn't seem like a lot considering their difference in price. A few more differences include the Bluetooth S Pen, a better placed finger print sensor, a slightly brighter screen, and the benefits of a longer Android update lifespan.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone lived with both? Is it worth the extra money? Are there significant features that will come with the 9 that I'm not seeing? Is the difference in battery really that noticeable? Thanks in advance. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",samsung,2019-06-01 09:28:59

My dad ordered a 'new' J5 from Amazon. He is not technically minded but tried setting it up himself. It was in French and he couldn't figure it out so went to a Samsung shop who told him it was Moroccan but switched it to English.

He went away and tried setting it up, put in a password then somehow locked the phone. The shop wouldn't do any more and told him to send it back.

The amazon seller is refusing to refund him because it's locked (not sure why they can't factory reset).  Amazon haven't been helpful.

I've told him to go back to the Samsung shop to get them to reset it but don't know if they will help.

Does anyone know the deal with Samsung battery replacements? Do they do a similar deal to Apple, in which they replace it in store for a fee? Any idea how much?

Will I naturally lose the IP rating if this is done too? Just curious, I like the idea of making a phone last as long as I can bare but battery refresh tends to be a real help in that regard (from past experience, usually the first thing to fade)

If I got a s10+ on Insight with the Verizon carrier, and I want to switch to T mobile am I allowed to switch Carriers? I tested a T mobile sim on it and it works without issues. I assume that if I switched carriers, as long as I keep using the phone and do the surveys I will be okay?

bx9ywi,"I'm going to try to keep this short and easy to understand. 

I purchased a new Gear Sport watch on December 2018 for $192.50 and I used it everyday for my workouts and throughout the day, I mainly used the Running and Cycling features on it and I loved the whole Samsung Health data it gave me. 

About 2 weeks ago I got the chance to go into an Olympic swimming pool and I thought it was a good idea to test the Swimming feature on the watch. I swam for about 30 minutes and the watch recorded the data, later at night when I placed the watch in the charging cradle it started to reboot constantly, I turned it off when it finally booted, and the next day I was able to charge it completely and it turned on normally. Then I noticed that the battery was draining incredibly fast and that the power button was not working anymore. 

I decided to send the watch for repair and I thought that if it was water damage it would've been a factory defect that caused it, because it was the first time I took the watch for a swim and this happened, and keep in mind that I bought the watch in December and it is supposed to have 1 year of Manufacturer Warranty. 

A few days after they received the watch, they sent me an update telling me that the watch is out of warranty because of liquid damage and that I have to pay $253.35 (way more than what I originally paid for it) for the repair. I called customer service, and talked to two representatives and they told me they could not do anything and that the watch is only ""water resistant"" and the water damage is not covered by the warranty, keep in mind that the watch supports 5ATMs which is roughly 165 feet and it is supposed to take surface swimming easily.  One of the service representatives even told me that I could only be in the water with the watch no more than 10 minutes. I also even spoke with someone in the repair department and explained everything and he just told me that I had to pay for the repair if I wanted the watch back. 

So this post is to let you know what you're in for in case one of your water resistant devices is damaged under warranty, I tried for hours to make them understand that it must have been a factory defect and they just ignored that and kept telling me to pay that crazy amount. I'm not getting a Samsung wearable again after this.",samsung,2019-06-06 08:13:46

bxtayz,"Hi there.

Just got my first Samsung, been an Iphone user for ages.A quick question, is there anyway to change so the notifications on the home screen is not cleared when you remove them from the ""pull down menu""? Like I get an e-mail but I dont want to read it right away but want to remove the notification from the pull down menu, but when I clear it, the notification is removed from the app itself. So is there a way to change that so the notification is still present, even if I clear it?

The reason im asking is that when I go into my phone later and the notification is removed that I have an un-read email for example, I wont see it until the next time I open the app, same with messages and yea everything else. Just because I dont want to read it right away, does not mean I dont want to be reminded that there is unread messages

I hate the UI changes a d the way it looks. I hate how it's not as simple to read notifications as it was before. I hate how everything looks more rounded now. Time is in the wrong location. I especially hate how when I now go to cycle through apps, the one I was most recently using isnt at the forefront. 

I know these are all minor gripes, but a lot of little shit adds up. It's honestly turning me off getting a other Samsung device when I get a new phone in a few months, which is sad as I've been buying Samsung gor years ever since jumping ship from Apple.

byauxl,"I just now got the June update because it kept prompting me when I was actively usibg my phone. I hate it. Almost everything about it, and as someone with a Master's in Human Factors, this isn't just ""oh it changed, I don't like change."" I know and understand interfaces, and the new ""features"" here do nothing at best, and ROB users of functionality at worst.

 

Lets start at the bottom of importance, the appearance. The new icons are blocky, primative, and look terrible on my old background. They make me think of a children's toy. The home and back buttons now feel like stickers on the bottom of my screen as well.

 

Related, but more intrusive, is the new recent apps menu (button left of Home on my device). The preview windows again feel like stickers, and you can only see the most recent app without scrolling! In the old layout I could see, click, and reopen several apps back which made multi-tasking or comparing windows so easy! Now if I want to compare more than two things, I have to constantly scroll back and forth, as they change order depending on when I opened them. Yes, the order used to change then too, but with the larger ""buffer"" of seeing several apps back it was a faster and clearer task. The scrolling itself even feels sluggish since you have to move through an entire screen to see one more option.

 

Want a similar example on a function EVERYONE uses, dozens of times a day? How about the new ""Messages"" app screen where, no joke, FIFTY PERCENT of the screen is DEAD SPACE. I KNOW I'm in messages! I can see them, right there! All my conversations! Or should I say FOUR of my conversations? You know, since that's all that fits without scrolling now? SUPER helpful to have LESS information avalible to me, and have it replaced with LITERALLY NOTHING. But this, I am forced to admit, at least still FUNCTIONS...

 

Now we get to one of the worst parts, the change in the settings buttons. Good lord is this a mess...buttons have entirely changed appearences, have been moved to other places in the menu, and some are flat out baffling! Because the Auto-rotate button is automatically grey, displays a lock, and says ""portrait"" it appears to be a button that TURNS ON screen lock. 90% of settings in phones color in when on, and turn grey when off. This is the established model in people's heads, and is reinforced even on Samsung phones. This button though changes meaning entirely when clicked, suddely lighting up, becoming an actual ""Auto Rotate"" button, and now indicating that rotate is ON. This one option uses two contradictory models simultaniously! Did a designer even LOOK at it?? 

 

Last point for me for now: Where did my Always On Display go!? I LOVED being able to see the time and my notifications simply by glancing down! It was a MAJOR selling point of the phone for me! Now, not only is ALL of that gone, even when I DO wake the phone the time is miniscule in one corner, I can see MAYBE three recent notifaction TYPES...I could read entire messages with one simple click on the old system! 

 

I have been touting the merits of Samsung phones up and down for YEARS now...even through the utter debachle that was removing individual text tones...and as a tech-savy person that is also educated in the design of interfaces, I can adapt to most changes very readily...but this is an absoulute travesty! Please, please, PLEASE roll back this interface!! I do not want to have to seeiously consider doing a 180 on my reccomendations to people, or have to find another brand when I upgrade!",samsung,2019-06-09 02:17:17

For example, one of the demo questions ""Why is the grass green?"" responds with this. That was in English. However, if I switched the language of Bixby to German or Spanish, then the Q&amp;A service works! Any idea why this is? How can I fix the Q&amp;A service in English on my device?

Things I've tried: clearing Bixby Voice cache, clearing Bixby Voice data, restarting device

And yes, I am legitimately using Bixby to at least give it a chance.

I have notified Samsung of this  issue and have been told to do a factory reset of the device and have  done so as instructed. The issue is still persistent. I took my phone to  a authorized repair facility located at best buy for them to tell me yes, my phone definitely  has an issue and they cannot re image the phone as every time they try to  it comes back to the old image. They instruct me to call Samsung and  get a replacement so I do, and Samsung tells me best buy doesn't know  what they are doing and to take it to this other address at 9977 E 82nd  street in Indianapolis however this address doesn't exist. It ended up being a UBREAKIFIX store, which was located at a different address.

I get I am probably one in a million here, and when it comes down to it one customer isn't a huge deal out of millions, but I rely on my phone every single day to be my right hand man in assisting me with directions, finding places to go and things to do as well as taking pictures. In my phone's current state it does not do a great job at these things and all I am asking Samsung to do is swap out my 1,250.00 phone.

In no particular order: the Samsung A50, Google Pixel 3a(+), One+ 6 etc, Apple Xr for example that are touted as huge savings opportunities. Which they are vs current flagship phones. But wait! If the main reason is to save money, have a ton of features why not look at last year's model? Phones have really plateaued for the last few years in ground breaking new features. We get a little better camera, display, some battery life but a lot is software. 

I'm scratching my head wondering why people would pay full price for a mid-range phone when there are flagship phones at steep discounts available.  There are a number of retailers out there that offer flagship from last year near or less the full purchase price of a new mid-range phone. Big savings lots of tech still packed in. 

People in the market for even better discounts could even find a refurbished device (which may add additional savings), especially since most places like Amazon, Bestbuy, BnH, all have return policies.

I was under the impression a recent software update was a false and targeted attack meant for me. During the installation of the software update; mid-way thru another phone's OS appeared on my screen. I assumed this was just the default Android software doing it's gimmick.  


Fast-forward 2-3 months later. Someone is controlling my phone remotely. I could see them switching between apps while I'm not active on my phone. They are controlling my apps. I took it as a simple revenge scheme planned by some crazy chicks/dudes. I let it continue for a while, trying to gather as much evidence and information I can.

&amp;#x200B;

It got way too crazy after my hacker started sending subliminal messages and replying to my voice thru YouTube and Spotify. I am not fucking kidding lol. I almost lost my sanity when this happened. This person would literally change my music as I asked them too while exercising, sleeping etc.  I got comfortable with the hacker, assuming it was someone close. I didn't have anything to hide.

&amp;#x200B;

I finally got sick of it and decided enough was enough. I started doubting my own friends and that drew the line.  
I ended up wiping my phone with a factory reset. I thought this would do the trick. However, the problems still exists.  


They still have full control of my phone, pausing changing YouTube videos and Spotify music as they pls. They have the ability to screenshot and control my music volume as well. It's obvious to me, that my phone is being remotely controlled and nothing anyone says in this thread will make my deny that.

They have the ability to open the google command prompt that opens while holding the ""Home"" button. Whenever they do this, a prompt for Bixby and Google opens asking for some permissions to open.

What the fuck am I supposed to do if a factory reset doesn't work.  
Should I format the phone on Windows? Would this brick my phone?

bzmhp2,"Hello  


I bought my first Samsung phone, a red Galaxy A10. I've had it for little over a week and I'm noticing a dark, smudgy discoloration on the back of the glossy red casing. It looks like two lines that are soft and patchy, almost like ink or even subtle stretch marks. 

I am incredibly careful about how I handle gadgets. I've never dropped a smartphone before and I've never had scratched screens or dents or anything in my gadgets because I take good care of them. That said, I don't use protectors, but this sort of issue seems unusual to me as it isn't a simple scratch or scuff.

Some notes about my usage:

* The device has been resting on a soft pleather notebook when not in use
* If I take it with me, I put it in a jacket pocket with no other items
* I've owned it for about a week and a half and only taken it out with me 4 times for brief trips to the supermarket, and I don't tend to take it out to use it

The only other detail is that the marking is to the right of the Samsung logo which is approximately where my index finger rests when holding the phone, but I haven't been engaging in messy activities where I might come into contact with stainable substances (art, baking, mechnical work) and I'm a frequent hand washer.

**Tldr;**

I guess my question is, what are the cheaper Samsung phones like in terms of resisting marks? Does anyone else have a red A10 and have they noticed discoloration? The idea that the phone might become discolored this quickly with low use is kind of frightening.",samsung,2019-06-12 12:07:29

bzsfr9,"First off, is there somewhere that I can leave feedback for samsung? If not I hope someone at samsung reads this. 

So I made the switch to android from apple about two years ago with the galaxy note 8 which is a pretty great phone and I really like it but I've had a more than a few issues with it. I was really impressed with the customer care though because they resolved my issues every single time.

The major issue I had was with the screen, after about 10 months of buying the Note 8 I began to notice an imprint of the keyboard on my screen, I visited the service centre and they replaced the screen for me and after a few months the new screen began to have the same exact issue so I went back to the service center but by now the warranty had expired and they expected me to pay for a new screen. I called customer care and told them it was not fair for them to expect me to pay for a screen that I have seen fail for me already twice so after some convincing they fixed for me for free and guess what? I'm having the same issue again and I doubt they are going to entertain me again. 

I hate having to see this imprint on my screen and was in half a mind to buy a oneplus but I noticed videos on youtube talking about a Note 10 coming soon so I decided to hold on a bit more and wait for the Note 10.

As per my understanding the note 10 is not going to have a headphone jack which honestly I'm not happy about but I can live without it if samsung provides usbc earphones. I am hearing that there will be no bixby button which I am grateful for! I hope samsung take a cue from oneplus and avoid packing the phone up with useless apps or at least let them be deleteable. I hate having my app drawer stacked with shit I don't use, same as with the iphone, I don't know why they force you to have their apps I mean preload them if you want but after paying a thousand dollars for a phone I expect the freedom to choose what apps I keep on it on remove from it.

Yo man people at samsung if you're reading this I gotta tell you I was a click away from buying the oneplus and it is only my positive experience with the samsung customer care and the note 8 in general that has convinced me to wait for a bit. Don't make me go to oneplus or apple because I will if you force me too.

Also can we please have something as quick as warp charging on the note 10? That would really help. Think of the kind of person that would buy note, we do a lot of our work on our phones. Battery life is paramount. Everything else can take a hike.

I have Sim 1 = O2 (mine) and sim 2 = 3 network (work)

The main reason is because i hotspot on 3g only as it has less problems when travelling on trains (1000 miles a week)

4g drops in and out its rubbish when you travel, 3g has its issues but overall less problems than 4g.

New owner of a Samsung S10 here. I'm absolutely loving this thing but one of the things I wish I could figure out is setting up a Saved Passwords option when I'm entering my username/password in the text field on some apps.  
  
As it was on the iPhone, as soon as I would click on the username field in apps like Instagram, PayPal, Mint, etc. It would *immediately* ask me above the keyboard whether I would like to Autofill the sections. I would click it, verify my PIN, and be done with it.  
  
As it appears on my S10, I can't do that. I've tried with Samsung Pass and I've tried with Google Smart Lock. I just tested both after registering my PayPal password on the respective browsers. When I open the PayPal app, it doesn't ask if I'd like to autofill the info.

bzxdvs,"Hey guys, I wanted to share with you my experience with Samsung’s trade-in program.  I know everyone has had different experiences, so just to give you guys an idea of what someone went through from beginning to end, here’s my experience:

  
TLDR:  Not good.  They rejected my phone for reasons that were definitely untrue, and I ended up getting my device back and being charged full price for the S10.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 01, 2019:**

Samsung was offering $350 for my LGV30.  I was very well aware of the negative reviews their trade-in was getting, but because it was more than double what I could sell it for on eBay, I went through hoping I wouldn’t be one of the unlucky ones.  I purchased the Galaxy S10 from their website and received an instant discount for $350 on checkout.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 02:**

Samsung ships the S10.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 06:**

I receive the package.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 10:**

I factory reset my old device, removed SIM and SD card, took photos of it for documentation, packaged it, and dropped it off with the shipping carrier (FedEx).

&amp;#x200B;

**May 14:**

The tracking info shows that they received the package.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 17:**

I receive the first email regarding my trade-in.  They rejected it claiming that I didn’t factory reset the phone.  They offered me $25 for it.  (My phone is also factory unlocked, so it's also not that).

I contacted Samsung so I can provide photos that would prove it was reset when I sent it to them.  They opened up a ticket and told me it could take 5 business days.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 18:**

I reconsidering fighting the decision after reading how drawn out these could get (some people online claiming it took weeks).  I didn’t want to risk it taking weeks only for them to decide arbitrarily that their decision stands and I can either take the $25.00 or forfeit the phone (Samsung only allows you to request a return for the first 7 days from when they make their decision).  I requested online that my device be returned.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 19:**

I receive an email saying my request to have my device returned has been accepted and I’ll receive an email with the tracking information once it’s shipped out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 29**:

I receive an email with the tracking number for my trade in-device.

I get charged the $350 to my Samsung Financing account.

&amp;#x200B;

**June 5:** 

I was having trouble with a FedEx driver who was caught lying about attempting delivery of my package, so I requested to pick it up at a local facility. (a story of it's own).

 I pick up my trade-in device at the FedEx facility.   To my utter disappointment, the phone was locked by whoever was handling it at the facility, but luckily I guessed the passcode on the first attempt - which was simply 0000.  The phone has been set-up enough to show you the homescreen.  I see an app installed on the phone called mceframework, which I couldn't find any info on.  I assume it was installed by them, so obviously the phone was not passcode locked.",samsung,2019-06-13 06:00:16

&amp;#x200B;

I need your thoughts on something I noticed last night on my new Galaxy S9+.

&amp;#x200B;

While the screen was on, there seems to be one pixel that just won't turn black when it should. If the whole screen is turned off, it's fine. But when it's on, that pixel will somehow stay on/visible in an area of the interface that's supposed to be black. Even when the Always On Display kicks in after I lock the phone, suddenly this pixel will also come on and just won't budge. It doesn't change color even. I'm not sure what's going on.  


Thankfully, it's within the return period, but the unit I have is already replacing a first one which exhibited Bluetooth problems. Even if I miss out on the chance to maybe swap out this new unit, I do have Geek Squad Protection (I bought the phone at Best Buy), so I'm not letting the issue get to me because during the day, I don't really notice it. It has to be very dark in the room and the part of the screen where it shows has to be black as I mentioned.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate your help, and so sorry if this is something that's already been discussed; I'm new in this subreddit. I appreciate your time and patience.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks, everybody!

&amp;#x200B;

I've this Samsung tablet in my kitchen, always plugged in to USB power. It's an SM-T520.  An older piece of hardware obviously, but its still good enough for recipes, home-assistant client, spotify, etc.  Basic stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the start of this year at some point, I've noticed this random behaviour where when I go to use it, I swipe to login, and none of the icons work.  I have to ""unblock"" it, but swiping down the menu, entering settings, closing settings, then stuff works. (this is super annoying)

&amp;#x200B;

After further monitoring/watching, eventually I caught it rebooting itself -- if left idle, suddenly it will restart, the Samsung logo appears, and Android boots.  (rinse and repeat cycle)

&amp;#x200B;

If I leave an app open that holds screen on (i.e. Arlo camera monitor app), the tablet will NEVER reboot itself. (so it seems related to ""power saving"" maybe in some way).

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone ever experienced this, and/or know how to debug it?  I tried installing some root log monitor app(s) but it doesn't yield anything interesting.  I'm a linux guy, but I have no idea how to debug Android.

Anyone experienced this phone with a screen protector? I'm in Canada and found a few on Amazon.ca, but none seem to talk about the scanner.

I feel embarrassed taking photos because they show up so shitty. Meanwhile, my BF iPhone 8+ can take some clear and gorgeous photos at night. It really upsets me that I paid so much for the phone and it doesn't perform when I need it to the most.

c0eh7c,"Has anyone else encountered this problem. It will charge, not charge, charge, and repeat. I tried 3rd party cords and they work fine. But the Samsung brand ones are garbage.
I've seen this problem on older phones and eventually you wont be able to even charge them. I'm worried and Samsung customer support is no help.
I had to go to 2 websights and call 2 people to get an answer of what to do, and that is. Send in my phone, and everything I got with the phone. I pay for shipping. Wait 7-14 business days for my money on my entire purchase back. Then buy a new one and wait for that to come in.
I purchased the phone last Friday when they had a deal and paid for the phone in full. I'm not sure but If the deal is gone I wont be able to re purchase my phone that I already had.

Is this a known problem with the phone, or are the chargers it ships with garbage???

Is there any easier way? This just seems like a bad way to treat a customer that just paid +$1,400 for a new phone. 
I understand business is business but how am I supposed to wait weeks for the phone I already paid for after they possibly messed up and sent me a faulty phone/charger???",samsung,2019-06-14 10:02:16

Talked with my provider (sprint) and also Samsung (through the Samsung health/members app). Both said to do a soft reset,  clear the app data &amp; cache, and a factory reset. 

I did all 3 steps and it still didn't fix the issue.  I then downloaded the Android Messages app. All of a sudden, it started working again. It worked well for about a year or so. 

After the latest software update (Android Pie and Sasung U.I.), Android Messages began to work intermittently.  I've been switching back and forth between both since the update, and both will work with the RCS feature, then stop.

bvfj9g,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

So I've had my Galaxy S8 since it launched and have been extremely happy with it. I have had Samsung phones since the S2 and have always loved them. Problem is my battery life is really poor now that I've been using it for 2 years, plus I have a small yet deep corner crack in the screen glass that could easily damage the display if it gets worse. Bottom line is I'm looking for an upgrade and I have always wanted a Note. Looking on Ebay, I could get the Note 8 in open box/new condition for around [$350](https://www.ebay.com/itm/New-Samsung-Note-8-64GB-Unlocked-AT-T-Verizon-T-Mobile-Straight-Talk-Metropcs/123752966100?epid=8025407723&amp;hash=item1cd04067d4%3Am%3Am4vcp0xizwUMpiCyAfa9OLQ&amp;LH_ItemCondition=1500%7C1000)  or I could get a Note 9 in the same condition for [$550](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-9-SM-N960F-DS-128GB-FACTORY-UNLOCKED-6-4-DUAL-SIM/142895344603?epid=16029493163&amp;hash=item214539ebdb%3Am%3AmcEH7AAnZQx_9FBix8OEYXA&amp;LH_ItemCondition=1000%7C1500). 

&amp;#x200B;

Is the Note 9 worth the extra $200? The biggest difference for me at least is the bigger battery. Its one of the main reasons I'm looking to upgrade from my old S8 but the 17% increase from Note 8's 3,300 mAh to the Note 9's 4,000 mAh doesn't seem like a lot considering their difference in price. A few more differences include the Bluetooth S Pen, a better placed finger print sensor, a slightly brighter screen, and the benefits of a longer Android update lifespan.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone lived with both? Is it worth the extra money? Are there significant features that will come with the 9 that I'm not seeing? Is the difference in battery really that noticeable? Thanks in advance. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",samsung,2019-06-01 09:28:59

Is there any way (I do have a wireless charger) to charge the device and have this without having to buy a full Dex Station? I tried searching for like USB C splitter, but can't find any. My first idea would be to use wireless charger, but considering the phone gets hot from Dex and hot from charging, I don't want my S9 to become a Note 7. Is it safe?

The battery is still going strong and does me fine, but I am finding it isn't as capable at long hard days as it used to be, as is with general use over the life of any phone

I believe it's still in warranty, 2 years as far as I'm aware. Haven't needed to use it though.

Does anyone know the deal with Samsung battery replacements? Do they do a similar deal to Apple, in which they replace it in store for a fee? Any idea how much?

Will I naturally lose the IP rating if this is done too? Just curious, I like the idea of making a phone last as long as I can bare but battery refresh tends to be a real help in that regard (from past experience, usually the first thing to fade)

I am coming from an iPhone 6s and haven't upgraded in 4yrs so the Pixel 3 trumped it in comparison, but just did not feel like a 2019 phone. I didn't even care much for the whole ""but muh pixel camera doe"" thing since honestly the s10e takes amazing photos (from what I can see so far). I don't even use social media so the camera doesn't matter to me. People say they hate ""dat dang samsung bloatware"", but honestly, the s10e feels like a much more unison and cohesive experience and does not feel bloated as much as people make it out to seem. The ui is amazing and does not stutter or lag when scrolling or switching apps. 

What it came down to is wanting to feel like I'm getting a 2019 phone in the year of well, 2019, and the s10e is right there with the modern specs to back it up. The Pixel 3 (even if realized in 2018) was and is still far behind these Samsung phones.

bx9ywi,"I'm going to try to keep this short and easy to understand. 

I purchased a new Gear Sport watch on December 2018 for $192.50 and I used it everyday for my workouts and throughout the day, I mainly used the Running and Cycling features on it and I loved the whole Samsung Health data it gave me. 

About 2 weeks ago I got the chance to go into an Olympic swimming pool and I thought it was a good idea to test the Swimming feature on the watch. I swam for about 30 minutes and the watch recorded the data, later at night when I placed the watch in the charging cradle it started to reboot constantly, I turned it off when it finally booted, and the next day I was able to charge it completely and it turned on normally. Then I noticed that the battery was draining incredibly fast and that the power button was not working anymore. 

I decided to send the watch for repair and I thought that if it was water damage it would've been a factory defect that caused it, because it was the first time I took the watch for a swim and this happened, and keep in mind that I bought the watch in December and it is supposed to have 1 year of Manufacturer Warranty. 

A few days after they received the watch, they sent me an update telling me that the watch is out of warranty because of liquid damage and that I have to pay $253.35 (way more than what I originally paid for it) for the repair. I called customer service, and talked to two representatives and they told me they could not do anything and that the watch is only ""water resistant"" and the water damage is not covered by the warranty, keep in mind that the watch supports 5ATMs which is roughly 165 feet and it is supposed to take surface swimming easily.  One of the service representatives even told me that I could only be in the water with the watch no more than 10 minutes. I also even spoke with someone in the repair department and explained everything and he just told me that I had to pay for the repair if I wanted the watch back. 

So this post is to let you know what you're in for in case one of your water resistant devices is damaged under warranty, I tried for hours to make them understand that it must have been a factory defect and they just ignored that and kept telling me to pay that crazy amount. I'm not getting a Samsung wearable again after this.",samsung,2019-06-06 08:13:46

I've remapped the Bixby button to open settings on a single click and for a week or two it's been fine. Out of nowhere, whenever I single click Bixby, it goes to Bixby despite the setting still saying that a single click will open settings. Tried resetting and restarting phone but nothing works and my local Samsung support store had terrible ratings on Google. 

Also,  I've turned on the setting that says ""use volume keys to adjust media"" and same story as the Bixby button, it worked for abit but then reverted back to adjusting volume for everything but media.

Just got my first Samsung, been an Iphone user for ages.A quick question, is there anyway to change so the notifications on the home screen is not cleared when you remove them from the ""pull down menu""? Like I get an e-mail but I dont want to read it right away but want to remove the notification from the pull down menu, but when I clear it, the notification is removed from the app itself. So is there a way to change that so the notification is still present, even if I clear it?

The reason im asking is that when I go into my phone later and the notification is removed that I have an un-read email for example, I wont see it until the next time I open the app, same with messages and yea everything else. Just because I dont want to read it right away, does not mean I dont want to be reminded that there is unread messages

byauxl,"I just now got the June update because it kept prompting me when I was actively usibg my phone. I hate it. Almost everything about it, and as someone with a Master's in Human Factors, this isn't just ""oh it changed, I don't like change."" I know and understand interfaces, and the new ""features"" here do nothing at best, and ROB users of functionality at worst.

 

Lets start at the bottom of importance, the appearance. The new icons are blocky, primative, and look terrible on my old background. They make me think of a children's toy. The home and back buttons now feel like stickers on the bottom of my screen as well.

 

Related, but more intrusive, is the new recent apps menu (button left of Home on my device). The preview windows again feel like stickers, and you can only see the most recent app without scrolling! In the old layout I could see, click, and reopen several apps back which made multi-tasking or comparing windows so easy! Now if I want to compare more than two things, I have to constantly scroll back and forth, as they change order depending on when I opened them. Yes, the order used to change then too, but with the larger ""buffer"" of seeing several apps back it was a faster and clearer task. The scrolling itself even feels sluggish since you have to move through an entire screen to see one more option.

 

Want a similar example on a function EVERYONE uses, dozens of times a day? How about the new ""Messages"" app screen where, no joke, FIFTY PERCENT of the screen is DEAD SPACE. I KNOW I'm in messages! I can see them, right there! All my conversations! Or should I say FOUR of my conversations? You know, since that's all that fits without scrolling now? SUPER helpful to have LESS information avalible to me, and have it replaced with LITERALLY NOTHING. But this, I am forced to admit, at least still FUNCTIONS...

 

Now we get to one of the worst parts, the change in the settings buttons. Good lord is this a mess...buttons have entirely changed appearences, have been moved to other places in the menu, and some are flat out baffling! Because the Auto-rotate button is automatically grey, displays a lock, and says ""portrait"" it appears to be a button that TURNS ON screen lock. 90% of settings in phones color in when on, and turn grey when off. This is the established model in people's heads, and is reinforced even on Samsung phones. This button though changes meaning entirely when clicked, suddely lighting up, becoming an actual ""Auto Rotate"" button, and now indicating that rotate is ON. This one option uses two contradictory models simultaniously! Did a designer even LOOK at it?? 

 

Last point for me for now: Where did my Always On Display go!? I LOVED being able to see the time and my notifications simply by glancing down! It was a MAJOR selling point of the phone for me! Now, not only is ALL of that gone, even when I DO wake the phone the time is miniscule in one corner, I can see MAYBE three recent notifaction TYPES...I could read entire messages with one simple click on the old system! 

 

I have been touting the merits of Samsung phones up and down for YEARS now...even through the utter debachle that was removing individual text tones...and as a tech-savy person that is also educated in the design of interfaces, I can adapt to most changes very readily...but this is an absoulute travesty! Please, please, PLEASE roll back this interface!! I do not want to have to seeiously consider doing a 180 on my reccomendations to people, or have to find another brand when I upgrade!",samsung,2019-06-09 02:17:17

The 5G rollout is sparse, so I'm guessing my phone is trying to find 5G signal and is depleting pretty quickly in comparison to the S10+ it replaced. Looking at 5.5hrs of SOT give or take on mixed usage (Reddit, YouTube, Spotify etc), vs 7hrs on the S10+.

So, i have been using my slowly dying LG G6 for the last year or so and I've been wondering whether to buy the A70 or S9+. Even though my LG G6 is slow and buggy I still appreciate its flagship features such as IP68 and its high-res display. But I'm also looking for something more modern looking with longer battery life. 

On Amazon I found both phones going for the exact price from decent sellers. The A70 is new while the S9+ is renewed by Amazon.

I don't plan on playing intensive 3D games however I do appreciate a quick phone on daily tasks and want a clean software experience Both phones should work perfectly with my carrier.

bziri8,"Over the last quarter there have been a ton of mid-range phones coming to market. In no particular order: the Samsung A50, Google Pixel 3a(+), One+ 6 etc, Apple Xr for example that are touted as huge savings opportunities. Which they are vs current flagship phones. But wait! If the main reason is to save money, have a ton of features why not look at last year's model? Phones have really plateaued for the last few years in ground breaking new features. We get a little better camera, display, some battery life but a lot is software. 

I'm scratching my head wondering why people would pay full price for a mid-range phone when there are flagship phones at steep discounts available.  There are a number of retailers out there that offer flagship from last year near or less the full purchase price of a new mid-range phone. Big savings lots of tech still packed in. 

People in the market for even better discounts could even find a refurbished device (which may add additional savings), especially since most places like Amazon, Bestbuy, BnH, all have return policies. I totally get and love the thrill on purchasing a new device. Let's be honest - most of us get sweeter satisfaction when no one else has touched it.

bzjtfl,"I'll try to keep this short. 

For the last few months I've been keeping a close look at my apps and usage on my S9 Galaxy.  
I was under the impression a recent software update was a false and targeted attack meant for me. During the installation of the software update; mid-way thru another phone's OS appeared on my screen. I assumed this was just the default Android software doing it's gimmick.  


Fast-forward 2-3 months later. Someone is controlling my phone remotely. I could see them switching between apps while I'm not active on my phone. They are controlling my apps. I took it as a simple revenge scheme planned by some crazy chicks/dudes. I let it continue for a while, trying to gather as much evidence and information I can.

&amp;#x200B;

It got way too crazy after my hacker started sending subliminal messages and replying to my voice thru YouTube and Spotify. I am not fucking kidding lol. I almost lost my sanity when this happened. This person would literally change my music as I asked them too while exercising, sleeping etc.  I got comfortable with the hacker, assuming it was someone close. I didn't have anything to hide.

&amp;#x200B;

I finally got sick of it and decided enough was enough. I started doubting my own friends and that drew the line.  
I ended up wiping my phone with a factory reset. I thought this would do the trick. However, the problems still exists.  


They still have full control of my phone, pausing changing YouTube videos and Spotify music as they pls. They have the ability to screenshot and control my music volume as well. It's obvious to me, that my phone is being remotely controlled and nothing anyone says in this thread will make my deny that.

They have the ability to open the google command prompt that opens while holding the ""Home"" button. Whenever they do this, a prompt for Bixby and Google opens asking for some permissions to open.

What the fuck am I supposed to do if a factory reset doesn't work.  
Should I format the phone on Windows? Would this brick my phone?

bzmhp2,"Hello  


I bought my first Samsung phone, a red Galaxy A10. I've had it for little over a week and I'm noticing a dark, smudgy discoloration on the back of the glossy red casing. It looks like two lines that are soft and patchy, almost like ink or even subtle stretch marks. 

I am incredibly careful about how I handle gadgets. I've never dropped a smartphone before and I've never had scratched screens or dents or anything in my gadgets because I take good care of them. That said, I don't use protectors, but this sort of issue seems unusual to me as it isn't a simple scratch or scuff.

Some notes about my usage:

* The device has been resting on a soft pleather notebook when not in use
* If I take it with me, I put it in a jacket pocket with no other items
* I've owned it for about a week and a half and only taken it out with me 4 times for brief trips to the supermarket, and I don't tend to take it out to use it

The only other detail is that the marking is to the right of the Samsung logo which is approximately where my index finger rests when holding the phone, but I haven't been engaging in messy activities where I might come into contact with stainable substances (art, baking, mechnical work) and I'm a frequent hand washer.

**Tldr;**

I guess my question is, what are the cheaper Samsung phones like in terms of resisting marks? Does anyone else have a red A10 and have they noticed discoloration? The idea that the phone might become discolored this quickly with low use is kind of frightening.",samsung,2019-06-12 12:07:29

bzsfr9,"First off, is there somewhere that I can leave feedback for samsung? If not I hope someone at samsung reads this. 

So I made the switch to android from apple about two years ago with the galaxy note 8 which is a pretty great phone and I really like it but I've had a more than a few issues with it. I was really impressed with the customer care though because they resolved my issues every single time.

The major issue I had was with the screen, after about 10 months of buying the Note 8 I began to notice an imprint of the keyboard on my screen, I visited the service centre and they replaced the screen for me and after a few months the new screen began to have the same exact issue so I went back to the service center but by now the warranty had expired and they expected me to pay for a new screen. I called customer care and told them it was not fair for them to expect me to pay for a screen that I have seen fail for me already twice so after some convincing they fixed for me for free and guess what? I'm having the same issue again and I doubt they are going to entertain me again. 

I hate having to see this imprint on my screen and was in half a mind to buy a oneplus but I noticed videos on youtube talking about a Note 10 coming soon so I decided to hold on a bit more and wait for the Note 10.

As per my understanding the note 10 is not going to have a headphone jack which honestly I'm not happy about but I can live without it if samsung provides usbc earphones. I am hearing that there will be no bixby button which I am grateful for! I hope samsung take a cue from oneplus and avoid packing the phone up with useless apps or at least let them be deleteable. I hate having my app drawer stacked with shit I don't use, same as with the iphone, I don't know why they force you to have their apps I mean preload them if you want but after paying a thousand dollars for a phone I expect the freedom to choose what apps I keep on it on remove from it.

Yo man people at samsung if you're reading this I gotta tell you I was a click away from buying the oneplus and it is only my positive experience with the samsung customer care and the note 8 in general that has convinced me to wait for a bit. Don't make me go to oneplus or apple because I will if you force me too.

Also can we please have something as quick as warp charging on the note 10? That would really help. Think of the kind of person that would buy note, we do a lot of our work on our phones. Battery life is paramount. Everything else can take a hike.

Im still a bit hazy with using 2 sims (first time etc) but when i hotspot i need it to use the work sim and data 
I have Sim 1 = O2 (mine) and sim 2 = 3 network (work)

The main reason is because i hotspot on 3g only as it has less problems when travelling on trains (1000 miles a week)

4g drops in and out its rubbish when you travel, 3g has its issues but overall less problems than 4g.

New owner of a Samsung S10 here. I'm absolutely loving this thing but one of the things I wish I could figure out is setting up a Saved Passwords option when I'm entering my username/password in the text field on some apps.  
  
As it was on the iPhone, as soon as I would click on the username field in apps like Instagram, PayPal, Mint, etc. It would *immediately* ask me above the keyboard whether I would like to Autofill the sections. I would click it, verify my PIN, and be done with it.  
  
As it appears on my S10, I can't do that. I've tried with Samsung Pass and I've tried with Google Smart Lock. I just tested both after registering my PayPal password on the respective browsers. When I open the PayPal app, it doesn't ask if I'd like to autofill the info.

TLDR:  Not good.  They rejected my phone for reasons that were definitely untrue, and I ended up getting my device back and being charged full price for the S10.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 01, 2019:**

Samsung was offering $350 for my LGV30.  I was very well aware of the negative reviews their trade-in was getting, but because it was more than double what I could sell it for on eBay, I went through hoping I wouldn’t be one of the unlucky ones.  I purchased the Galaxy S10 from their website and received an instant discount for $350 on checkout.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 02:**

Samsung ships the S10.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 06:**

I receive the package.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 10:**

I factory reset my old device, removed SIM and SD card, took photos of it for documentation, packaged it, and dropped it off with the shipping carrier (FedEx).

&amp;#x200B;

**May 14:**

The tracking info shows that they received the package.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 17:**

I receive the first email regarding my trade-in.  They rejected it claiming that I didn’t factory reset the phone.  They offered me $25 for it.  (My phone is also factory unlocked, so it's also not that).

I contacted Samsung so I can provide photos that would prove it was reset when I sent it to them.  They opened up a ticket and told me it could take 5 business days.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 18:**

I reconsidering fighting the decision after reading how drawn out these could get (some people online claiming it took weeks).  I didn’t want to risk it taking weeks only for them to decide arbitrarily that their decision stands and I can either take the $25.00 or forfeit the phone (Samsung only allows you to request a return for the first 7 days from when they make their decision).  I requested online that my device be returned.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 19:**

I receive an email saying my request to have my device returned has been accepted and I’ll receive an email with the tracking information once it’s shipped out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 29**:

I receive an email with the tracking number for my trade in-device.

I get charged the $350 to my Samsung Financing account.

&amp;#x200B;

**June 5:** 

I was having trouble with a FedEx driver who was caught lying about attempting delivery of my package, so I requested to pick it up at a local facility. (a story of it's own).

 I pick up my trade-in device at the FedEx facility.   To my utter disappointment, the phone was locked by whoever was handling it at the facility, but luckily I guessed the passcode on the first attempt - which was simply 0000.  The phone has been set-up enough to show you the homescreen.  I see an app installed on the phone called mceframework, which I couldn't find any info on.  I assume it was installed by them, so obviously the phone was not passcode locked.",samsung,2019-06-13 06:00:16

bzzedp,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I need your thoughts on something I noticed last night on my new Galaxy S9+.

&amp;#x200B;

While the screen was on, there seems to be one pixel that just won't turn black when it should. If the whole screen is turned off, it's fine. But when it's on, that pixel will somehow stay on/visible in an area of the interface that's supposed to be black. Even when the Always On Display kicks in after I lock the phone, suddenly this pixel will also come on and just won't budge. It doesn't change color even. I'm not sure what's going on.  


Thankfully, it's within the return period, but the unit I have is already replacing a first one which exhibited Bluetooth problems. Even if I miss out on the chance to maybe swap out this new unit, I do have Geek Squad Protection (I bought the phone at Best Buy), so I'm not letting the issue get to me because during the day, I don't really notice it. It has to be very dark in the room and the part of the screen where it shows has to be black as I mentioned.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate your help, and so sorry if this is something that's already been discussed; I'm new in this subreddit. I appreciate your time and patience.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks, everybody!

1. Can the watch access an internet browser?
2. Can I load e-books (I know the sceen is small, but still would be nice) on the watch?
3. Does it have the ability to access Facebook as a whole app (not just messenger)?
4. Youtube?
5. Does it have the option to connect to my phones wifi hotspot? Or does the bluetooth allow me to connect to the internet?

I guess I'm mostly curious as to what the full functionality is on a smart watch. Is it like a smart phone but shrunken down and on your wrist? Or is the app variety extremely limited?

* Samsung Wireless Charger Duo Pad (2019) - priced at 99€ (Slovenia)
* Samsung Fast Wireless Charger - priced 11€ (Alixpress) - due to price I doubt it is original... Ali website states it is original tho

&amp;#x200B;

I have to point out ""Wireless Charger Duo Pad (2019)"" supports Fast Charge 2.0, which is supported by Samsung, but not Apple iPhone.

c05nof,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I've this Samsung tablet in my kitchen, always plugged in to USB power. It's an SM-T520.  An older piece of hardware obviously, but its still good enough for recipes, home-assistant client, spotify, etc.  Basic stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the start of this year at some point, I've noticed this random behaviour where when I go to use it, I swipe to login, and none of the icons work.  I have to ""unblock"" it, but swiping down the menu, entering settings, closing settings, then stuff works. (this is super annoying)

&amp;#x200B;

After further monitoring/watching, eventually I caught it rebooting itself -- if left idle, suddenly it will restart, the Samsung logo appears, and Android boots.  (rinse and repeat cycle)

&amp;#x200B;

If I leave an app open that holds screen on (i.e. Arlo camera monitor app), the tablet will NEVER reboot itself. (so it seems related to ""power saving"" maybe in some way).

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone ever experienced this, and/or know how to debug it?  I tried installing some root log monitor app(s) but it doesn't yield anything interesting.  I'm a linux guy, but I have no idea how to debug Android.

&amp;#x200B;

Specs/Details:

* SM-T520
* Android 4.4.2
* kernel 3.4.39-2776001
* Build KOT49H.T520UESAQA4
* SE enforcing, ASKS v1.2\_161011",samsung,2019-06-13 21:12:40

I've seen this problem on older phones and eventually you wont be able to even charge them. I'm worried and Samsung customer support is no help.
I had to go to 2 websights and call 2 people to get an answer of what to do, and that is. Send in my phone, and everything I got with the phone. I pay for shipping. Wait 7-14 business days for my money on my entire purchase back. Then buy a new one and wait for that to come in.
I purchased the phone last Friday when they had a deal and paid for the phone in full. I'm not sure but If the deal is gone I wont be able to re purchase my phone that I already had.

Is this a known problem with the phone, or are the chargers it ships with garbage???

Is there any easier way? This just seems like a bad way to treat a customer that just paid +$1,400 for a new phone.

9k7hi2,"I’ve been using iPhones since I started using smartphones (mid 2000’s or so). My last phone I’ve kept was the iPhone 6s, because every model since has lost the 3.5mm jack and I couldn’t bring myself to get rid of it. 

Well, my 6s is starting to die off and the new iPhone models frankly suck in price. I’ve been looking at going android, but I have my concerns. 

Samsung seems to have the best for what I’ve seen, and I’ve been looking at going to the Galaxy S9 or the Note 9. The Note 9 seems to have the best features, I’m mostly worried it’ll be too big to carry in my pocket and I don’t do the belt carry thing. 

My main needs are that it has a battery that can last at least a full shift at work (anywhere from 8-10 hours) and is -somewhat- sturdy enough to survive if I fall on it, if I have to fight with it in my pocket, etc (of course a case is my primary purchase after the phone). 

I also have an extensive iTunes collection of music and movies, is there any way to get those working on my new phone if I do switch to Android (which is...looking pretty certain)?

Thanks for the help. ",samsung,2018-09-30 16:06:08

9k7nby,"I'm on a 2 year contract with Verizon with 1 year to go. I'm a heavy phone user and the s8+ that I have is starting to get a severe burn in. The top and bottom bars are always visible. Even while watching a movie. 
I don't have warranty on it. 

Do I trade it in and get me the Moto z3 through Verizon for $480 or get the note 8 for $899? 
Issue is then I'd have 2 years to pay on the phone instead of 1. 

Do I get the warranty through Samsung or through Verizon or no warranty? 

Do I just deal with the burn in for a year and then sell the phone?

They state in the listing that this variant of the Note 9 is GSM only. Verizon uses CDMA. I would not be able to provide an intelligent explanation for what the hardware differences are between phones on either network, but mixing this up has caused an expensive problem for me in the past when the BlackBerry Z10 came out. Anyway, I spoke with a representative via Samsung's website and she/he said it wouldn't be an issue ""...as the new Samsung Note 9 phones comes with dual bands so it supports both CDMA and GSM as well.""

What am I missing here—who is correct? Has there been a minor revision in the Note 9 that perhaps this batch of Note 9s predates? At this point, is the difference only that of a software update? The eBay seller accepts free returns within 30 days, so it seems fairly low risk. 

While were at it: I presume these Notes are from out of the U.S. Are there any foreseeable problems with going this route? Should I just go with a Blue or Lavender model?

9k8pok,"Hello guys,

I have heard rumours that if you use Airpods on android devices (in my case it will be the note 9 if I am to get it) you lose some sound quality. I have read reviews saying that airpods are 'mediocre' sounding headphones but I am not really a sound enthusiast and when I tried using them on my sisters Iphone, they sounded great and felt comfortable.

Right now i'm twisted between getting the Iphone X (yes the X not XS/XR/XSM) or the Note 9. Both are going to be the same price from where I get it from (so price isn't an issue for me here) but what will influence my decision will be if the Airpods sound worse on the note 9 because I don't want an unbearable experience.

You could say 'Lend just get the IconX then'. No, I can't, i've already bought the airpods which you could call my mistake, but they just seem a lot more comfortable to deal with than the icon X and prettier in my opinion. The case is just nicer for the airpods.

I believe that the Note 9 is better than the Iphone X and to be honest I prefer the sexier note 9 and the more beautiful screen but god damn I also love the IOS economy.

At this point you may be thinking I did say i'm not a 'sound enthusiast'. Yes that is true but I also don't want the sound to sound garbage because the quality is worse on samsungs.

Thanks all!

The first phone I fell in love with was the S2 and it was absolute magic. Note 3 was a close second. Since then I've had the S7 and S8 plus. I enjoyed them, but I didn't love them. 

The Note 9 is the first device I love in a long time. It's so darn good. The S-pen is fantastic. The battery life is long. Camera is great, especially with the new update. The speakers are powerful. I compared them to my girlfriends iphone XS and they sounded tinny in comparison. 

And it's just so *darned smooth*. That's what I've been missing for a long time. Super slick, no lag animations.

The only drawback is the price. But like Warren Buffett said the other day ""Smartphones are ridiculously underpriced considering the value and utility we get.""

9ki3ir,"There's a reason samsung took part in the manufacture of Apple's OLED pannels for the iphone X. The quality and life of Samsung's OLED pannels is higher than Lg's or any other company.

There were recent problems with OLED pannels of Lg and most manufacturers who made such displays on TVs and Smartphones etc. After about a year of use the displays would start to fade and get browner(it's named with the misleading ""burnouts""). This is because the blue pixels require more energy because they run less efficient than the red or green, and so making their life shorter.

But how is Samsung trying to avoid this?


If you look up the OLED pixels of samsung devices such as the S9. The blue pixels have different shapes that cover a larger area individually, so they require lesser power to emit the same amount of light as the diode is larger and has to emmit lesser light per unit area to fulfill the ratio with other color pixels.

Samsung has good blueshift management, their pixels are shaped and effectively spaced out but on an OLED pannel, blueshift will be visible. It's not a problem though, because it occurs at angles no one ever views from. 


The companies who manufacture OLED pannels must look into the problems instead of eliminating them from the warranties and try solving the issues, because it's a great advancement in display technology and we shouldn't let the issues continue with development. Peace and farewell!

9kk3od,"My TV went out 2 weeks ago. I spoke with someone over chat and they determined that a tech would have to.come out to repair the TV. That's fine, it still has 6 months left on the warranty. The next day samsung calls me and tells me I need to try and troubleshoot the issues myself, so they dont need to have it repaired. The troubleshooting link the sent me doesnt work. I go back to chat again and they agree that a tech has to come out for a repair.

On thursday, a tech shows up and says I need a new screen and also a new power supply. He then informs me that samsung doesnt have my screen in stock and they are estimating over a week to to get it. He said that if it is going to be longer than that then samsung will probably just give me a new TV. 

The following Monday I am checking the status of my ticket and it shows that on Friday it was closed.  I chat with an agent and they state that it was decided I will be getting a new TV, and that someone from the exchange department will be contacting me in 3-5 days. Since I am very impatient I call in on thursday. I am transferred to the exchange department. They explain that since I uploaded my receipt from best buy that this process will be easier and quicker. They tell me that I will be getting reimbursed to best buy for what I paid. He said that it would take 5 days for me to get an email informing me of my next steps. He also said that those 5 says include weekend days, in was a little shocked but cool that's even sooner.

So here I am on Monday, since nothing ever happened with my ticket until I called in I just figured I'd call and see what's going on. I speak with someone on the phone, and they said that my ticket shows that I requested an exchange and the exchange department will contact me in 11-12 business days. I said, that's not what I was told by the exchange department and asked to be transferred to them. I am told that the exchange department does not accept phone calls and they only call customers. They then told me that I didnt speak to anyone in the exchange department and I spoke to a regular agent, and they apologized about the turn around time being wrong.

So of course, now I'm kinda angry and hang up with the tech. I go back to online chat to find a direct number to the exchange department and they tell me to call the support line, give them my ticket number and they would transfer me to the exchange department.

I waited a few hours and tried again and I ask to be transferred. I'm told they cant do that. She puts me on hold probably to see if she can transfer me and come back and says that I will hear from someone in 11-12 days.

So I'm just so pissed that no one can transfer me to this department to speak with someone about and issue that I have already discussed with them. They are just jacking me around and I have no idea what else to do. I guess the only thing I can do is wait 11-12 days for someone to contact me and start this entire process over. At this point I'm going on 2 weeks without my TV, and it's probably going to be another 3 weeks before anything gets resolved.

9kr7wr,"Hello, I would appreciate some advice on which Samsung phone to buy next. I'm coming from a 2 year old Galaxy S7 Edge, and I'm starting to have issues with battery life and my phone being generally slow at times. I deleted anything I decided I didn't need that was using memory and/or battery and it didn't really help. 

I'm torn as to what phone I should get next. Here are my thoughts:

S9 - Pros: smaller handset but still a bigger screen than I have now (I have smallish hands), lower price (not my primary concern, but it's still a pro); Cons: I'm concerned about going to a smaller battery given my battery life issues with my S7 Edge, lesser features than S9+ or Note 9 (though I'm not sure how much the second rear facing camera, extra RAM, and/or storage would impact me).

S9+ - I really like the features, but the size might be unwieldy. I also don't love how oblong this phone is; yeah, the screen is technically bigger, but it's a skinny rectangle so how useful is that, really?

Note 9 -  it's the best Samsung has to offer, so of course I'm intrigued. The S pen, the only reason to choose this over the S9+, feels a bit gimmicky to me and I'm not sure how much I'd use it. I'm weird and peck at my smartphone keyboard with one hand to type, so its use as a stylus may come in handy.

In other words, if I begin a sentence with the word ""we're,"" as in ""We're going to be a few minutes late,"" I use my shortcut ""wr"" and while it turns it into ""we're"" it doesn't capitalize it as the first letter of the sentence, as it would do with any other word (which SKP is capable of).

9kt93l,"Found a thread that solves the issue of one earbud being too loud or soft campared to the other or both being soft at max volume. Takes about 10 or so minutes and I highly recommend doing this:

1. Remove silicon earbud

2. You should see mesh plating. Take a paper clip or something similar and push against an edge of the mesh at an angle. Try not to push directly down as this will push the mesh in rather than sliding it around for removal.

3. Remove the inner piece that you will see. It's basically a cloth with glue along the outer ring that allows Samsung to claim water ""resistance"". Picture of this 'cloth' http://imgur.com/gallery/m1iEXk2

4. Place mesh back, be sure to press along the outer ring with a paper clip to ensure mesh is firmly in place.

Do this at your discretion as you may risk damaging it with any sweat or dust that can get in more easily now. But this makes your earbuds tolerable again as sound will be even now. Personally, I cut up a piece of paper towel and place it over the mesh on the outside to allow for easy, frequent change while providing adequate protection. As you can see in the pic from the link, my earwax was the cause of essentially filling up the cloth and blocking noise further, especially compared to my left. 

Note: I do keep earbuds very clean, and ears are clean too. Hardly use earbuds for workout but rather day to day listening.

9kw7mh,"Hey everyone. My wife and I were looking to get a Galaxy S9/S9+, one for each of us. Her phone has been acting up pretty badly. It took a few days for her to be fed up with it.

We saw the deal on the website for the free fit pro, and the discounted gear S3 frontier. Then, my wife wanted to wait, and then her phone became almost unusable. So, we took a look and the price had shot up by like 100 bucks. Then, today the price was back down, and they still had the deal for the fit pro or the s3 frontier +wireless charger.

She wasn't sure if she wanted the 9 or the 9 plus, so we took a drive over to best buy so she could see them face to face.

We came home and went to order the phones, and suddenly the deal has changed to some silly camera thing, or a ""vr"" system. Neither one is something we would use, so our interest kinda took a tumble. So, now we're back to waiting until a better deal comes up.

9l70nl,"I just got my Galaxy Watch yesterday and I've been having a ton of issues with it. I think some of them might be user error or me misunderstanding its capabilities but some of it is def not. 

1. Whenever I disconnect from Bluetooth and pick up LTE standalone it resends me all my SMS and MMS messages I've received since the last time it was unpaired. I was at a conference today and left my Note 9 in another room. As soon as it lost range I immediately got 73 SMS and MMS alerts. All messages that had been received since the night before when I had it unpaired. It happend again later when I walked my dog around the block, only this time it was only the17 messages I had received since this afternoon. 

2. Can it not be paired to my IconX?  While walking today I was playing music through my IconX. I received an incoming call which I answered on my watch. The callers voice was coming through my watch speaker instead of my headphones, even though my phone showed I was on an active call. That was frustrating. I had to take out my headphones, end the call, and then call them back from my phone. 

3. When I am driving its detecting a bicycle exercise, which is probably the funniest of the annoyances. I was going 80mph on the highway and my wrist buzzed. I looked down and it was showing me how many calories I'm currently burning during my ride. It did this both times I drove on the highway.  In case you were wondering the answer is 1400 today. 

4. I cant respond to email via Outlook? I have to set up that account through the default email app, which I don't really want to do. I guess that might make sense but still annoyed. 

5. Battery - granted I have been playing with it all day (set up was done yesterday followed by a full battery charge so it's not the strain of that) but it went from 100% to 15% in 13 hours. That might be normalish but I was expecting better. Samsung says 3 days with light usage. I consider myself a heavy user (near constant email, Group Me, and SMS) but I thought I'd get at least 18-20 hours based on their claim.

6. It already overheated and turned off to cool itself. I was listening to a voicemail and using the dialer to delete the message when it froze and alerted me that it was powering down to allow it to cool. It only took about 1 minute to do so but this is a brand new watch and pretty unacceptable. 

Overall I guess I thought it would do more and be more impressive but it's mostly a headache. I work for a wireless provider in store so I'm pretty familiar with new tech. I have 0 issues sorh my Note 9 and I love my IconX as well as my new Duo charger. Am I missing something here with the watch?

[Copy of the complaint](https://www.classaction.org/media/bianchi-v-samsung.pdf)

Loyal Samsung customer here. Switched from iPhone to the Galaxy SII years ago and never looked back. Even went full Samsung appliances when I renovated the kitchen a couple years ago. 

Going through the Note 7 debacle sucked though I remained undeterred. 

Recently noticed puddles of water on the floor below the fridge,  which coincided with slushy ice, reduced ice volume &amp; dispense speed, water filling the little catch/evaporation tray below the dispenser and significant amounts of water collecting in the bins inside the door below the ice maker shoot.

At first I assumed the door wasn't being fully shut though after several mornings of finding fresh water puddles despite confirming both doors were firmly closed each night before going to bed, it was clear something was wrong. 

Decided to dig around the interwebs. Got as far as typing ""Samsung ice"" when Google suggested ""Samsung ice maker lawsuit"" - Article after article, even Samsung's own community site, chronicled exactly what I was experiencing to the letter. 


Based on what I've read so far, it seems there is no true ""fix"", rather the problem is a fundamental design flaw of the entire ice making and dispensing system, specifically fatal insulation defects ranging from gaps on all sides, inside and out, of the ice maker itself to woefully inadequate gaskets such as the one meant to seal the door and ice shoot when closed, allowing non-freezing temperature air from the fridge to infiltrate the ice box, rendering the device incapable proper operation,  leading to melted ice, water leakage, over frosting and a cascade of associated mechanical failures as parts systematically lock up and burn out.


Since 2015, at least two service bulletins were issued by Samsung to their service technicians acknowledging the defects and prescribing mandatory ""fixes"", in some cases with special hardware kits, all without notifying customers, allowing ignorance to effectively robbing their consumers of the opportunity to address the defects under warranty, before the defects manifested in actionable malfunctions, which typically begins shortly after the 12 month warranty expires.


TBH, I was surprised when my reddit searches about the lawsuit came back empty. 

Has anyone else heard of or know anything about this? Really hope Samsung makes this right before/without being forced to do so through litigation. ",samsung,2018-10-04 13:31:02

Also note that if you do not use data in each of the specific content categories of your Samsung Cloud, such as contacts, calendars, photos, videos, keyboard data, etc., for more than twelve months, the respective content category and its data will be deleted and you will no longer be able to recover that data. Samsung will provide you with 30-day advance notice prior to the deletion of your data. For purposes of this provision, “use” or “used” shall mean accessing, uploading to, or downloading data from Samsung Cloud services. 

&gt; 3.10 If any of your devices have not backed up to Samsung Cloud for more than one year, Samsung reserves the right to delete any backups associated with such device. Note that the backup may include call logs, SMS/MMS, app installation package data, app settings, music and document files, voice recordings, and information on device settings. Samsung will notify you of the backup expiration date. You are entirely responsible for backing up or storing your content or information before the expiration date to avoid loss of your content. Samsung is not liable or responsible for any loss that occurs due to you not taking action to back up or store your content and/or data.

I wonder if it means just things on the Samsung Cloud can be deleted, or whether ""backups associated with you device"" also refers to data backed up with Google, or other cloud services. I don't see why Samsung would have access to that sort of thing, but it straddles a fine line between ""Pay for our service or we'll fuck you up"" and ""Use it or lose it"".

HOWEVER; Bixby, the assistant that I didn't ask for, is slowly, but surely, making me dislike the phone for all the wrong(and unnecessary) reasons! I have nothing against Bixby's existence - it's Samsung's thing and it's existence is not something which has bothered me or should bother me at all. 

And a part of me gets it; it's a technology which is innovative, a very valid entry into a highly competitive scene. 

But why can't I, as a user of the device, have the option to not use it? Since buying the phone, earlier this year, I have probably had to disable the Bixby Home Screen on 10 different occasions after Samsung having enabled it by itself again. 

Samsung - take, the, hint!

The Bixby button is a different thing entirely. After the warranty runs out I'll definitely deactivate that button mechanically. Which is a weird thing to have to do. I do use Google Assistant sometimes, even though it's just for general curiosity about the technology itself, and its advances. 

The Bixby has a very different status in my books, as well as other Samsung users, probably. Having the Bixby repeatedly pushed on me like this means that I will never, ever, open it intentionally, not even for the sake of curiosity! Which can't be good for a technology that you want people to see.

I have a Samsung Galaxy s5 that I just received as a manufacturer's warranty replacement about a month ago. I flashed Lineage OS 15.1 on the phone as soon as I got it. It started acting up and boot looping last night, as well as having almost every process crash constantly, so I did a full factory wipe and re-flashed it last night.

Today, I am constantly getting the `android.process.acore keeps stopping` flashing on my screen, it's so quick that I don't even have time to read it. I have tried almost everything that I could find online to stop this issue. I've disabled contacts, I've cleared the cache and data from the contacts app, i removed permissions from the contacts app, I remove contact permissions from google (since it was having me restore my google backup when I set the phone up again), and it continues to flash. There's nothing listed for 'contact storage' so I'm unable to disable that. If I go to Settings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Privacy Guard -&gt; 3-dot menu -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Personal &gt; 3-dot menu &gt; and click on contacts storage, it shows me that 'read contacts' has been used 1646 times, and  in the next menu, messaging, messages has been used 10k+ times, and phone services has been user 10k+ times.

So far it is very fast a fluent, but I do get some very tiny stutters in games such as PUBG. This is probably more to do with the game's optimisation and not due to the Note's performance as it is a beast overall.

I love the big, high display. Split screen and all the tons if customisation.

""Touchwiz"" has really evolved since the last time I have used it and is so far a great experience.

9lxul7,"To set the context , I have been a Note 4 then Note 7 user. After which I was forced to downgrade to S7 edge. This year, I moved to the Note 9 , 8gb, 512 model. So yes, I upgrade once every 2 years

As a fairly experienced Note user, I was expected nothing major , just incremental improvements but I was pleasantly surprised when it was not.

I can say that this has been my largest upgrade since I have started using smartphones back in 2010 with a Iphone 3gs. 

Things that surprised me

1. The speed and fludity of Note 9

I love the Note series, but when I switched over from the iphone 4s to Note 4, the main thing I noticed was the horrible lag. Old time Note 4 users probably remember the delay when multitasking or when taking a photo and tapping on the gallery. It didn't help that I was the type of user who ran all sort of apps in the background, many with permissions for usage data access, device admin, notification access tc.

To give you a taste, I run Tasker + various plugins, IFTTT, almost all the good lock apps,  One handed operation+ (before that I was using third party apps), etc. 

I'm also a smart home person and have multiple apps pertaining to that and heavy user of Google assistant.  The same setup in S7 edge made it lag a lot.

Note 9 is the first phone that is not phased by all this. Maybe its the 8gb ram, maybe it optimization but for once, I had a phone that could do everything and not lag. In fact, I see lag only in 2 situations - sometimes when I charge up and it tries to upgrade a lot of apps. I also think some of the good lock apps, do cause bixby voice to wake up slowly, but I'm not a big bixby fan.

For further context, I have not done any optimization like package disablers etc and yet the Note 9 is amazing

&amp;#x200B;

2. The big beautiful screen means I'm using the S-pen , netflix more

I have to admit I have never really used the spen regularly in the past. But I find myself using Note 9 a lot more. It's not just the blue tooth capabilities but rather because the screen is big enough that writing notes seems to make more sense.

I also find myself using the split screen function a lot more, again courstery of the bigger screen

I have relatively poor eyesight, so I always found the Note screens small for watching netflix etc, but it seems somewhere around the time of Note 8/9 the screen became big enough I find myself watching netflix a lot more now, even though when I'm at home I can easily cast it to my tv.

&amp;#x200B;

3. 512gb +SD card gives you a ton of freedom

I always carry a SDcard... that carries around all my photos. I do use dropbox and google photos to sync photos but I like the security of a local files. When I was forced to download grade to a s7 edge i was pissed. 64gb was not enough space for me, i had tons of apps and 1 game and kept running out of space. I suspect part of the reason why my S7 edge was slow was also it didnt have much disk space and i was constantly clearing things out.

With my 512gb Note 9, I have no such worries. I even copied everything out of my sdcard into the phone memory and no longer use a SD card (perhaps this is another reason why things are so speedy). 

&amp;#x200B;

4. Comments on battery life

Given that I run so many apps, I was not expecting amazing battery life. Still I currently can get 5 hr SOT and 15 hours total time when going from 80% to 40%. That's actually quite impressive. Since I'm using only 40-50% of the full capacity. This is without optimising battery life. 

&amp;#x200B;

5. Camera and misc

I'm not much of a camera person, but i was comparing night scenes with my S7 edge the other day and the difference was excuse the pun - like day and night. There might be better cameras but Note 9 is good enough for me. 

I've played around with Dex but it is not for me.

&amp;#x200B;

6. Software features

People on reddit, cry for stock. But at the cost of giving up secure folder? No thanks. Secure folder is used by me to store all my bank apps, my password manager etc. 

I also currently rock adhell3 (amazing ad blocker that doesnt use battery) and navigation gestures (which maximises screen estate), all apps and features that let you enjoy the max out of the big beautiful screen the Note 9 has.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall Samsung Note 9 looks to be much better than the sum of it's parts. In a way the Note 9 is the ultimate evolution of Galaxy phones since the S6/7 in terms of hardware and software. S10 will be exciting but likely going to be a flawed product as Samsung irons out the kinks in the new technologies employed like inscreen fingerprint scanners and foldable screens. I still remember the early fingerprint sensors in Samsung phones were the horrible swipe type...

In fact, I find Samsung's Iris and face recognition technologies still fairly hit or miss.....and they have had at least 2 years to figure it out.... 

I can heartily recommend the Note 9.

I am looking to buy a Samsung TV in China, and this one fits our needs and budget:

https://product.suning.com/0000000000/622386743.html

However it seems to say that it's an LCD TV. I've looked up the model on other sites and they also state LCD.

I bought a 49"" Samsung TV before and it was an LED one, and as I understand LED is the better type. This Chinese models seems to state LCD despite being a flat-screen TV with very thin bezels. I tried searching specifically for an LED Samsung TV but haven't had much luck.

Can any of you confirm whether this is actually an LCD, or perhaps the Chinese are just using LCD and LED interchangeably? ",samsung,2018-10-08 05:24:12

9mcsbg,"Long time iPhone user, started at the 4 ending with my current 6s (nothing in between, just those two).

My iPhone 6s is starting to die out on me. Details aside, I’m considering going Samsung.

Some things I would like to know:

- I use iTunes to organize my MP3s. I greatly prefer having the music directly on my phone as most streaming services don’t have my favorite artist (Akino Arai). How does Android OS handle music? Would I need to download a particular app?

- I work retail with cellphones. I’ve activated and troubleshooted basically every make and model as of the last two years, and hot damn do I see a lot of spamware on Android OS. Between apps that place ads everywhere to intrusive programs that change how the phone boots up, I’ve seen tons of things. Only on Android, not on iOS. What preventative measures could I take other than not being a moron and downloading every “make your phone faster” app available?

- Anything else I should know before getting one? I already have an existing Google account, but I almost never use it other than to log into Youtube. What notable features does Google offer?

9mduyj,"I'm writing to see if my issues with the earphones are just mine or if other users have experienced similar issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I often run using my gear icons and bought them for this purpose. However I sweat and sometimes the sweat I guess gets into the earphones and it causes sound imbalance in the earphones. I didn't see this issues pop-up in reviews before I bought them. I had the earphones replaced by the Samsung store 3 times and this morning I applied for a replacement a 4th time after the sound imbalance. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I first bought the earphones, I asked the staff to give me information about the product, they gave me the wrong information, as in described the ambient noise feature incorrectly and the type of charger the case uses. Anyways, today I asked the staff if I could speak to the store manager to discuss what I can do once my warranty comes to an end (it ends in february) because I've faced this issue several times (maybe I can trade in, extend warranty or get store credit etc etc.), however they said I have to speak to the technical support manager, I asked whether he's in today and they said no, so I asked when will he be in and the staff simply replied ""I don't know"". I persisted for the staff to find out when he will be in and they went to the back and come back and said ""he should be in tomorrow, but we don't know when he will come in, he's a very busy man with his meetings and work."".

&amp;#x200B;

I explain why I wanted to speak to the manager and the staff simply said ""he won't be able to help you, he won't extend you warranty or anything like that. He will tell you what we will tell you and that's to just call the samsung careline. They proceeded to write the number on a small piece of paper and just passed to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure If I'm alone in facing this type of customer service or whether it's the norm to be dealt with like this. Even first when I was interested in buying the earphones, I went to another branch and they treated me poorly as well for wanting to test the earphones before buying it. I'm currently residing in Malaysia and felt that Samsung has had poor service over its branches here, not sure about other countries. ",samsung,2018-10-08 10:58:11

Scrolling on these phones is NOT smooth at all. Text gets blurry when scrolling and images also get blurry and some colors such as blue and black even ""ghost"". Why is this a problem in 2018 ???

&amp;#x200B;

When I'm scrolling, regardless of the speed, regardless of the content - I don't care if it's 100 4K images one under another, there should be 0 blur, no framerate drops, whatsoever or nothing at all. All the text and images should be cristal clear the whole time you're scrolling and the framerate should never drop below 60-70 fps. I mean these are 1000$ phones after all.

And then there are a few people disputing those claims by saying that has been solved in 2012/2013. I'm really doubtful that 'lag' happens very often to flagship phones but also curious about it. Is there any truth on those claims and how much of an issue is it?

A few days after I sent it in to them I got an email saying I would be charged back the $250 that I had been credited because my phone failed to meet the requirements. They noted ""display does not function"" however it obviously did and they even sent me photos of the phone front and back where on the front the display is fully on and working.

I filed a claim and called them, the lady I spoke to said, ""Yeah it looks like it's fine, I think we made a mistake **this happens fairly often**"" and she made a ticket for me.

One month goes by, no response, 2 months no response, I call and they say it'll be a few more days. 3 months, nothing, I call again, they say it's still being checked. Finally today I contact them and am relentless that I get some answers. It's been 4 months.

9myegk,"1: No notches. Honestly, the worst trend smartphones have ever had in their past is the damn notches. if we don't have the technology to make a full edge to edge screen, then we should start to develop towards it instead of going towards alternatives such as notches or motorized cameras. technology is advancing quite fast in this era of development, in my opinion,it's worth waiting for some breakthrough tech to come up like a camera under the pixels of the screen, which turn off when the camera is activated. or even the pixels themselves acting like sensors for light and the whole screen works as a camera. It's better to move towards that with reducing bezels instead of notches.

2: HEADPHONE JACK. i know a lot of great phones such as the iphone X, Oneplus 6T, Mate 10 pro or even the google Pixel 3 are eliminating the headphone jack, it's not a useful thing to do, all it does is adds more problems. I've done some research on the audio quality of the USB C cables and the headphone jack input cables, TTRS or TRS, Both input a much higher quality audio than the USB C because they've been designed for specific constructions for a complete audio spectrum (has parts for every enhancement) the tip,ring, and sleeve which all have a different contribution to the sound quality hand have been optimized for it. The USB C isn't adapted for sound and audio quality and needs a lot of development to reach the level of the TRS cables. wireless connections put a limit to the headphones you can use, and dongles don't improve quality.

Extra: since Samsung is a gigantic company, producing everything from refrigerators to smartphones to TVs.

Turns out Samsung is offering double the value for trade-in of phones, including the LG G6 - a whole $300!  Add in an additional $100 off and an .edu discount, and the total came to $320, tax included.

If I wanted to grab the Pixel, they'd offer me $95 for the LG G6 and it would cost $864.92 for the 64Gb variant (with no option to add more memory down the road).

So, Samsung it is for her now!",samsung,2018-10-11 00:47:46

I like change and had a itch so I was considering getting the Pixel 3XL. I had a Galaxy S9+. 

Watched the keynote and was disappointed. Sure the phone is stock android and I'm sure its snappy but 4gb ram just isn't going to cut it. Additionally the lack of a headphone Jack is a no go for me. I have wireless headphones but it's always nice having the option. 

So I ended up getting the Note 9. Not much of a upgrade but it satisfies that itch and I couldn't be happier. ",samsung,2018-10-11 01:02:01

I've got a projector a couple of weeks ago, and Chromecast yesterday, and I tried to watch an anime from my tablet, but as you could guess from the fact that I'm posting here, I couldn't find a good way to have subtitles casted as well.

Google Home, and the tablets own casting feature cuts the display in half. (shows subs, but it's a bad experience)
Samsung Smart View can't find any Samsung Tvs.
Localcast and all the other casting apps don't show the subs.
VLC doesn't even show the casting button (don't know why), but this very question was asked of them and they don't support this.

https://samsungpromotions.com/galaxyupgrade/ explicitly names Samsung.com, Best Buy, and AT&amp;T as eligible for the double-value-trade-ins, so no problems there. But they have a 4th button for ""All Other Retailers"", which has basically the same instructions of all the other ones except the step when you get the ""rebate"" - Download Shop Samsung App, register, ensure trade in phone meets their eligibility requirements, ship trade in phone to them, etc. 

In the app, they have several retailers and carriers listed in a dropdown, but then they have an Other option as well. Again, this seems to imply that I can buy the phone from ANY retailer or carrier (some which have much better prices than others), and as long as my trade in device is approved and I buy the phone within the specified dates I can get the double trade in value promotion. The only difference would be instead of getting the rebate immediately at checkout as with Samsung, AT&amp;T, and Best Buy, I'd get it after the trade in device is sent in and approved?

Hey Guys, I need your help. My Phone just randomly died a few days ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I was watching some Videos and after that I went to sleep. As always, I charged my phone while I'm sleeping. I've been doing that since I got the phone last year. The battery never seemed to be damaged by that.    

When I woke up and I took my phone to check if I got any messages. I unplugged my phone from the charging cable and noticed that the red LED wouldn't turn off. Pressing the Home button, the power button or anything else caused no response. I thought it was a system crash but I couldn't even force restart my phone. It doesn't seem to boot up in safety mode either. I didn't charge my phone after this happened to let the battery life run out to make sure the phone is oof    

Two days after that the red LED turned off. I assume the battery life was over at that time. Once I noticed that I've been charging my phone for about 2 hours before trying to boot it up again. Yet again, no response. I couldn't force restart.    

It's been 3 days now and my phone still appears to be dead. Is it really dead or can I fix it?    

I own this phone since November last year and it was in unopened packaging. I dropped it only once 6 months ago. I didn't download much and only from trusted sources so I doubt there is a virus on my phone. It never ran really hot.

9nyib2," Personally, I believe that the status bar (the bar on top) and the navigation bar are completely unnecessary and take away A LOT from the screen and experience. Which is why I figured out a way to utilize your entire screen without costing you productivity too much. 

The first thing that you want to do is enable the fingerprint sensor gestures as well as the one-handed mode gesture. After that you want to go to developer options and enable USB debugging.

Download ABD: [https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip)

(you should also have the Samsung drivers installed)

(I will not go into detail on how to use ABD but I will try to make it short and easy: Extract ABD to your C drive. Connect your phone to your computer. Open Command Prompt and go the ABD folder. The command for that is “cd” followed by the path. For example: “cd C:\\ABD” . Once you’re in the ABD directory, you want to type “abd devices” in command prompt. Look at your phone, a message should pop up asking you to confirm, you want to click ok on that one. Once that’s done and your device is recognized, you can proceed to the things below)

&amp;#x200B;

After that you want to download something called System UI Tuner from the Play Store, followed by something called Gesture Control. 

System UI Tuner will allow you to hide the status bar everywhere. However, I personally like to have the status bar ONLY on my home screens. As for in apps, I don’t want it there as it is completely useless. Once you open System UI Tuner you want to follow the steps it tells you. Once it’s time to grant permissions, which it will also tell you, you will need copy paste these 3 commands in the command prompt ABD window that you should have opened by now. Here they are:

adb shell pm grant com.zacharee1.systemuituner android.permission.WRITE\_SECURE\_SETTINGS

adb shell pm grant com.zacharee1.systemuituner android.permission.PACKAGE\_USAGE\_STATS

adb shell pm grant com.zacharee1.systemuituner android.permission.DUMP

&amp;#x200B;

DO NOT DISONNECT YOUR PHONE YET

Once that’s done you should be able to use System UI Tuner. Go to the tweaks &gt; Immersive Mode and you want to click on the Status Bar checkbox. This will now hide the status bar (you can still access it by swiping down on top of the screen). Now to make it visible only on your homescreens, where it says App Specific, you want to Enable that, enable the Blacklist right below it and right below the Blacklist you want to click on Select Apps. Scroll down and find your launcher name and select it.(Mine for example is Nova Launcher so I find Nova Launcher and click on it) Now your status bar will only be visible on the home screen. Any other app that you open it won’t be there. You can enable the status bar for any other app you want by the way, the same way you enabled it on the home screen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now you want to open Gesture Control and follow the instructions once again, you will have to enable its accessibility service and then for the permissions, you will have to copy paste this code in the command prompt window:

adb shell pm grant com.conena.navigation.gesture.control android.permission.WRITE\_SECURE\_SETTINGS

&amp;#x200B;

Once that’s done, you can go inside the app disable the original navigation bar and do whatever you want pretty much. What I did was increase the left and right sensitivity, change some of the gestures, disable others, I also disabled the vibration feedback cuz it annoys me. Oh and I also moved the pill slightly up. You can pretty much do this however you want. If you’re new to this it will take some tweaking until you get it just right. This is basically android Ps gesture navigation.

I’ve used this setup for months now and can honestly say that I wouldn’t be able to live without it. The default status bar and navigation bar take too much space and make the phone feel like a cheap piece of garbage while with this it truly feels premium. Hope this helps. Here are two screenshots of what it looks like:

&amp;#x200B;

I recently realized that it's possible to display a streamed content from Popcorn time directly on my TV (I have a Samsung smart tv KS7000).

The thing is that everything seems to work fine on Popcorn time's side (it shows that the movie is streamed on my TV) but nothing happens on the TV's side. The source doesn't seem to be recognized and I cannot find my PC (with the popcorn time application launched) in the list of sources on my TV.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is whether there is any specific option I should look for in my TV or any application I should download (such as a specific video player) to be able to find the source and hence watch the video?

I am assumed so because if you read the output on a standard Samsung smart charger, its output does list 9volt which is equivalent to QC2 (QC3=12v) and allows fast charging. You have to use a 'fast charge' compliant charger to ever achieve 'fast charge'. Now the strange thing is I bought one of [these](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/8-in1-USB-Detector-Voltmeter-Ammeter-Power-Capacity-Tester-Voltage-Current-Meter/113226483312?_trkparms=aid%3D555017%26algo%3DPL.CASSINI%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20180905084510%26meid%3D62de713bf4aa49bbaa1beda30dd36821%26pid%3D100505%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D1%26%26itm%3D113226483312&amp;_trksid=p2045573.c100505.m3226) which only ever shows the output voltage of the stock Samsung Charger as 5volt, even when the screen shows 'Fast Charging'. So wondering why/how the 9volts gets switched to?

I have another QC3 12volt cig adapter in my car, and it too only ever outputs 5volt for fast charging. So it seems Samsung only ever equates fast charging to more amps, rather higher voltage. I had read that QC was a way of switching 2x3.7volt cells in Samsung batteries (usually in parallel), in series for charging at 9volt. Anyone confirm how Samsung achieves fast charging?

I'm more of a business power user, so I use it primarily for communication and the likes.  I only have a handful of apps installed, such as:

* Evie launcher (I've also used Apex, Nova, Go, and the default Samsung)
* Spotify
* Keep
* MyMail
* OurGroceries
* Textra
* Amazon
* Business calendar
* Calendar snooze
* Fitbit
* Ecobee
* Liftmaster (garage door thing)
* Lyft
* Mint
* Starbucks
* A file sync tool
* My bank

I've disabled/removed the games, and unneeded apps like NFL, Slacker Radio, Handcom office, etc.

The problem that happens very often is I will be listening to music, or texting, or using Google maps, and someone will call me ... and **the phone will lag so much that the call screen will never appear**.  I can hear the phone ringing, but the screen is black.  There is no way to see who is calling or answer it.  Obviously, this is a bit of a problem if I'm waiting for a work call.

I've factory reset the phone at least 6 times, removed nearly all the apps, and it still happens.  I even got a new S7 from Verizon (warranty) and it does the same thing!

Is it just me?  It makes me a little mad that the phone is pretty much useless after just two years.  Yeah, it would be nice to upgrade, but I don't feel like shelling out $800 for a new phone to solve a problem that didn't exist a few years ago.

9or4uv,"Hi Guys,

I recently was provided a Samsung S9 for work managed by Meraki MDM and I just noticed that when I go into settings I do not have the ""Cloud and Accounts"" section listed on the settings page it seems to be replaced with a section called ""Accounts"". 

&amp;#x200B;

If I select the ""Accounts"" section I can then drill down to the ""Backup and Restore"" section but once there I only see the following text grayed out:

Samsung Account: Backup service not available prevented by security policy

and

Google Account: Backup service not available

&amp;#x200B;

I've checked our Meraki (KNOX) setup and there is no option blocking any type of cloud backups or any similar restrictions in place.

&amp;#x200B;

If I navigate to the Google section in the S9's settings menu  and select the Backup option the ""Back up to Google drive"" is grayed out, I can turn it on but it does not stay activated and keeps on turning it self off.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been researching this problem for a while now with no solution, I even tried to remove/re-add my Google and Samsung account with no change.

&amp;#x200B;

I can however locate the ""Samsung cloud"" settings page and initiate a manual Samsung backup to cloud without issue.

&amp;#x200B;

I've reached out to our carrier and they advised they do not block any features, Samsung KNOX and MERAKI have no options to specifically block these features either and their phone support was unable to provide any solutions to this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone seen this problem before? any ideas to resolve?

&amp;#x200B;

There's a new battery issues in the SGS3, mine specifically is a frontier, no more than 2 months old. I am far from the only one with this issue, just google ""Samsung gear S3 charge issue"" and find some forum post and go to the most recent, I started having this issue about the same time as the rest (2-3 days ago)

There is no obvious cause for this issue, location services is randomly turning itself on, or at the very least no longer automatically turns itself off after a workout (run specifically). I used to have it last at least one day, I heard this used to do 3-4 from looking at old forum posts. I got it to last from waking up (7 AM) until 10:30 today before I was forced to charge it as I keep my charger with me... you never know. 

Location services has made no difference, if anything decreasing the battery life, as yesterday it went 6 hours instead of nearly 4. There's some automatic reporting features I have since disabled which I will keep you all up to date on. I'm a PC power user, not an android one, and definitely not a Samsung one, so I'm still learning the reins and how to full leverage every ""feature"" or should I say ""battery drainer"" the Samsung has at the moment.

Any ideas will help, if anyone else has had this issue PLEASE help spread the word, and if you guys could, tag @UnboxTherapy on twitter with #SamsungSGS3BatteryGate and get this ball rolling!

9p04k3,"Purchased 2 Samsung Note 8 phones in November of last year.

On both devices, experienced the issue wherein if the battery died, the device would no longer accept a charge (I manage a cell phone store, know it's dead). I called Samsung customer service and they had me send in my device for repair - swapped the battery, no biggie. 

However, this happened 3 more times on my device and 2 more times on my Wife's device in the course of 6 months. I also noticed that a lot of my customers with the S8 and Note 8 series devices were coming in with the same issue. So I knew it wasn't environmental, it was a bad MBR issue (didn't cut off power at 5% like every phone since forever).

On the 4th warranty call August 8th, I talked with a rep who stated that just to stop with all the issues that they would be sending me out a new Note 8 instead of simply replacing the battery on the device. I was satisfied with that, and accepted the terms given.

However, 3 weeks went by and I didn't receive the replacement. I looked at the tracker, and they had received it almost immediately. So there was no reason for the delay. I called into care again, and was told I would be contacted within 3 business days with a resolution. No call.

Instead I was mailed a refurbished Samsung S8.

I called care again, explaining the situation, and was told I would receive a call from a supervisor in 48 hours. No call. 

I called again, asked for a supervisor, and was told I would be contacted by THEIR supervisor in 48 hours. No call.

3 more calls, I'm not making this up. I went as high as the call center COULD go. Waited on the phone for 2:02:14 before I spoke with a person who told me that I would not receive my replacement until they got their S8 back. So they sent me a label via email.

I asked the person what kind of device I would be getting back at this point. He told me a refurbished Note 8. 

This is 10 weeks later. 

I will never purchase Samsung products again. I will never sell Samsung products to any customer again. I will instruct my team to explain the Samsung Plus experience to their customers to keep them from buying that product.

9k7nby,"I'm on a 2 year contract with Verizon with 1 year to go. I'm a heavy phone user and the s8+ that I have is starting to get a severe burn in. The top and bottom bars are always visible. Even while watching a movie. 
I don't have warranty on it. 

Do I trade it in and get me the Moto z3 through Verizon for $480 or get the note 8 for $899? 
Issue is then I'd have 2 years to pay on the phone instead of 1. 

Do I get the warranty through Samsung or through Verizon or no warranty? 

Do I just deal with the burn in for a year and then sell the phone?

They state in the listing that this variant of the Note 9 is GSM only. Verizon uses CDMA. I would not be able to provide an intelligent explanation for what the hardware differences are between phones on either network, but mixing this up has caused an expensive problem for me in the past when the BlackBerry Z10 came out. Anyway, I spoke with a representative via Samsung's website and she/he said it wouldn't be an issue ""...as the new Samsung Note 9 phones comes with dual bands so it supports both CDMA and GSM as well.""

What am I missing here—who is correct? Has there been a minor revision in the Note 9 that perhaps this batch of Note 9s predates? At this point, is the difference only that of a software update? The eBay seller accepts free returns within 30 days, so it seems fairly low risk. 

While were at it: I presume these Notes are from out of the U.S. Are there any foreseeable problems with going this route? Should I just go with a Blue or Lavender model?

9k8pok,"Hello guys,

I have heard rumours that if you use Airpods on android devices (in my case it will be the note 9 if I am to get it) you lose some sound quality. I have read reviews saying that airpods are 'mediocre' sounding headphones but I am not really a sound enthusiast and when I tried using them on my sisters Iphone, they sounded great and felt comfortable.

Right now i'm twisted between getting the Iphone X (yes the X not XS/XR/XSM) or the Note 9. Both are going to be the same price from where I get it from (so price isn't an issue for me here) but what will influence my decision will be if the Airpods sound worse on the note 9 because I don't want an unbearable experience.

You could say 'Lend just get the IconX then'. No, I can't, i've already bought the airpods which you could call my mistake, but they just seem a lot more comfortable to deal with than the icon X and prettier in my opinion. The case is just nicer for the airpods.

I believe that the Note 9 is better than the Iphone X and to be honest I prefer the sexier note 9 and the more beautiful screen but god damn I also love the IOS economy.

At this point you may be thinking I did say i'm not a 'sound enthusiast'. Yes that is true but I also don't want the sound to sound garbage because the quality is worse on samsungs.

Thanks all!

The first phone I fell in love with was the S2 and it was absolute magic. Note 3 was a close second. Since then I've had the S7 and S8 plus. I enjoyed them, but I didn't love them. 

The Note 9 is the first device I love in a long time. It's so darn good. The S-pen is fantastic. The battery life is long. Camera is great, especially with the new update. The speakers are powerful. I compared them to my girlfriends iphone XS and they sounded tinny in comparison. 

And it's just so *darned smooth*. That's what I've been missing for a long time. Super slick, no lag animations.

The only drawback is the price. But like Warren Buffett said the other day ""Smartphones are ridiculously underpriced considering the value and utility we get.""

9ki3ir,"There's a reason samsung took part in the manufacture of Apple's OLED pannels for the iphone X. The quality and life of Samsung's OLED pannels is higher than Lg's or any other company.

There were recent problems with OLED pannels of Lg and most manufacturers who made such displays on TVs and Smartphones etc. After about a year of use the displays would start to fade and get browner(it's named with the misleading ""burnouts""). This is because the blue pixels require more energy because they run less efficient than the red or green, and so making their life shorter.

But how is Samsung trying to avoid this?


If you look up the OLED pixels of samsung devices such as the S9. The blue pixels have different shapes that cover a larger area individually, so they require lesser power to emit the same amount of light as the diode is larger and has to emmit lesser light per unit area to fulfill the ratio with other color pixels.

Samsung has good blueshift management, their pixels are shaped and effectively spaced out but on an OLED pannel, blueshift will be visible. It's not a problem though, because it occurs at angles no one ever views from. 


The companies who manufacture OLED pannels must look into the problems instead of eliminating them from the warranties and try solving the issues, because it's a great advancement in display technology and we shouldn't let the issues continue with development. Peace and farewell!

9kk3od,"My TV went out 2 weeks ago. I spoke with someone over chat and they determined that a tech would have to.come out to repair the TV. That's fine, it still has 6 months left on the warranty. The next day samsung calls me and tells me I need to try and troubleshoot the issues myself, so they dont need to have it repaired. The troubleshooting link the sent me doesnt work. I go back to chat again and they agree that a tech has to come out for a repair.

On thursday, a tech shows up and says I need a new screen and also a new power supply. He then informs me that samsung doesnt have my screen in stock and they are estimating over a week to to get it. He said that if it is going to be longer than that then samsung will probably just give me a new TV. 

The following Monday I am checking the status of my ticket and it shows that on Friday it was closed.  I chat with an agent and they state that it was decided I will be getting a new TV, and that someone from the exchange department will be contacting me in 3-5 days. Since I am very impatient I call in on thursday. I am transferred to the exchange department. They explain that since I uploaded my receipt from best buy that this process will be easier and quicker. They tell me that I will be getting reimbursed to best buy for what I paid. He said that it would take 5 days for me to get an email informing me of my next steps. He also said that those 5 says include weekend days, in was a little shocked but cool that's even sooner.

So here I am on Monday, since nothing ever happened with my ticket until I called in I just figured I'd call and see what's going on. I speak with someone on the phone, and they said that my ticket shows that I requested an exchange and the exchange department will contact me in 11-12 business days. I said, that's not what I was told by the exchange department and asked to be transferred to them. I am told that the exchange department does not accept phone calls and they only call customers. They then told me that I didnt speak to anyone in the exchange department and I spoke to a regular agent, and they apologized about the turn around time being wrong.

So of course, now I'm kinda angry and hang up with the tech. I go back to online chat to find a direct number to the exchange department and they tell me to call the support line, give them my ticket number and they would transfer me to the exchange department.

I waited a few hours and tried again and I ask to be transferred. I'm told they cant do that. She puts me on hold probably to see if she can transfer me and come back and says that I will hear from someone in 11-12 days.

So I'm just so pissed that no one can transfer me to this department to speak with someone about and issue that I have already discussed with them. They are just jacking me around and I have no idea what else to do. I guess the only thing I can do is wait 11-12 days for someone to contact me and start this entire process over. At this point I'm going on 2 weeks without my TV, and it's probably going to be another 3 weeks before anything gets resolved.

9kr7wr,"Hello, I would appreciate some advice on which Samsung phone to buy next. I'm coming from a 2 year old Galaxy S7 Edge, and I'm starting to have issues with battery life and my phone being generally slow at times. I deleted anything I decided I didn't need that was using memory and/or battery and it didn't really help. 

I'm torn as to what phone I should get next. Here are my thoughts:

S9 - Pros: smaller handset but still a bigger screen than I have now (I have smallish hands), lower price (not my primary concern, but it's still a pro); Cons: I'm concerned about going to a smaller battery given my battery life issues with my S7 Edge, lesser features than S9+ or Note 9 (though I'm not sure how much the second rear facing camera, extra RAM, and/or storage would impact me).

S9+ - I really like the features, but the size might be unwieldy. I also don't love how oblong this phone is; yeah, the screen is technically bigger, but it's a skinny rectangle so how useful is that, really?

Note 9 -  it's the best Samsung has to offer, so of course I'm intrigued. The S pen, the only reason to choose this over the S9+, feels a bit gimmicky to me and I'm not sure how much I'd use it. I'm weird and peck at my smartphone keyboard with one hand to type, so its use as a stylus may come in handy.

9kt93l,"Found a thread that solves the issue of one earbud being too loud or soft campared to the other or both being soft at max volume. Takes about 10 or so minutes and I highly recommend doing this:

1. Remove silicon earbud

2. You should see mesh plating. Take a paper clip or something similar and push against an edge of the mesh at an angle. Try not to push directly down as this will push the mesh in rather than sliding it around for removal.

3. Remove the inner piece that you will see. It's basically a cloth with glue along the outer ring that allows Samsung to claim water ""resistance"". Picture of this 'cloth' http://imgur.com/gallery/m1iEXk2

4. Place mesh back, be sure to press along the outer ring with a paper clip to ensure mesh is firmly in place.

Do this at your discretion as you may risk damaging it with any sweat or dust that can get in more easily now. But this makes your earbuds tolerable again as sound will be even now. Personally, I cut up a piece of paper towel and place it over the mesh on the outside to allow for easy, frequent change while providing adequate protection. As you can see in the pic from the link, my earwax was the cause of essentially filling up the cloth and blocking noise further, especially compared to my left. 

Note: I do keep earbuds very clean, and ears are clean too. Hardly use earbuds for workout but rather day to day listening.

I can also be watching a YouTube video and get a text and sometimes it will cause a major lagspike, to where I have trouble opening messages. And even just in general, it will be running like the smoothest phone ever, and then almost crash itself due to some random lagspike.

I also rarely ever have more than 3 apps open.

9kw7mh,"Hey everyone. My wife and I were looking to get a Galaxy S9/S9+, one for each of us. Her phone has been acting up pretty badly. It took a few days for her to be fed up with it.

We saw the deal on the website for the free fit pro, and the discounted gear S3 frontier. Then, my wife wanted to wait, and then her phone became almost unusable. So, we took a look and the price had shot up by like 100 bucks. Then, today the price was back down, and they still had the deal for the fit pro or the s3 frontier +wireless charger.

She wasn't sure if she wanted the 9 or the 9 plus, so we took a drive over to best buy so she could see them face to face.

We came home and went to order the phones, and suddenly the deal has changed to some silly camera thing, or a ""vr"" system. Neither one is something we would use, so our interest kinda took a tumble. So, now we're back to waiting until a better deal comes up.

How often does Samsung cycle through deals on their website? It seems like it was jumping all over the place.",samsung,2018-10-03 00:22:18

9l70nl,"I just got my Galaxy Watch yesterday and I've been having a ton of issues with it. I think some of them might be user error or me misunderstanding its capabilities but some of it is def not. 

1. Whenever I disconnect from Bluetooth and pick up LTE standalone it resends me all my SMS and MMS messages I've received since the last time it was unpaired. I was at a conference today and left my Note 9 in another room. As soon as it lost range I immediately got 73 SMS and MMS alerts. All messages that had been received since the night before when I had it unpaired. It happend again later when I walked my dog around the block, only this time it was only the17 messages I had received since this afternoon. 

2. Can it not be paired to my IconX?  While walking today I was playing music through my IconX. I received an incoming call which I answered on my watch. The callers voice was coming through my watch speaker instead of my headphones, even though my phone showed I was on an active call. That was frustrating. I had to take out my headphones, end the call, and then call them back from my phone. 

3. When I am driving its detecting a bicycle exercise, which is probably the funniest of the annoyances. I was going 80mph on the highway and my wrist buzzed. I looked down and it was showing me how many calories I'm currently burning during my ride. It did this both times I drove on the highway.  In case you were wondering the answer is 1400 today. 

4. I cant respond to email via Outlook? I have to set up that account through the default email app, which I don't really want to do. I guess that might make sense but still annoyed. 

5. Battery - granted I have been playing with it all day (set up was done yesterday followed by a full battery charge so it's not the strain of that) but it went from 100% to 15% in 13 hours. That might be normalish but I was expecting better. Samsung says 3 days with light usage. I consider myself a heavy user (near constant email, Group Me, and SMS) but I thought I'd get at least 18-20 hours based on their claim.

6. It already overheated and turned off to cool itself. I was listening to a voicemail and using the dialer to delete the message when it froze and alerted me that it was powering down to allow it to cool. It only took about 1 minute to do so but this is a brand new watch and pretty unacceptable. 

Overall I guess I thought it would do more and be more impressive but it's mostly a headache. I work for a wireless provider in store so I'm pretty familiar with new tech. I have 0 issues sorh my Note 9 and I love my IconX as well as my new Duo charger. Am I missing something here with the watch?

[Copy of the complaint](https://www.classaction.org/media/bianchi-v-samsung.pdf)

Loyal Samsung customer here. Switched from iPhone to the Galaxy SII years ago and never looked back. Even went full Samsung appliances when I renovated the kitchen a couple years ago. 

Going through the Note 7 debacle sucked though I remained undeterred. 

Recently noticed puddles of water on the floor below the fridge,  which coincided with slushy ice, reduced ice volume &amp; dispense speed, water filling the little catch/evaporation tray below the dispenser and significant amounts of water collecting in the bins inside the door below the ice maker shoot.

At first I assumed the door wasn't being fully shut though after several mornings of finding fresh water puddles despite confirming both doors were firmly closed each night before going to bed, it was clear something was wrong. 

Decided to dig around the interwebs. Got as far as typing ""Samsung ice"" when Google suggested ""Samsung ice maker lawsuit"" - Article after article, even Samsung's own community site, chronicled exactly what I was experiencing to the letter. 


Based on what I've read so far, it seems there is no true ""fix"", rather the problem is a fundamental design flaw of the entire ice making and dispensing system, specifically fatal insulation defects ranging from gaps on all sides, inside and out, of the ice maker itself to woefully inadequate gaskets such as the one meant to seal the door and ice shoot when closed, allowing non-freezing temperature air from the fridge to infiltrate the ice box, rendering the device incapable proper operation,  leading to melted ice, water leakage, over frosting and a cascade of associated mechanical failures as parts systematically lock up and burn out.


Since 2015, at least two service bulletins were issued by Samsung to their service technicians acknowledging the defects and prescribing mandatory ""fixes"", in some cases with special hardware kits, all without notifying customers, allowing ignorance to effectively robbing their consumers of the opportunity to address the defects under warranty, before the defects manifested in actionable malfunctions, which typically begins shortly after the 12 month warranty expires.


TBH, I was surprised when my reddit searches about the lawsuit came back empty. 

Has anyone else heard of or know anything about this? Really hope Samsung makes this right before/without being forced to do so through litigation. ",samsung,2018-10-04 13:31:02

Also note that if you do not use data in each of the specific content categories of your Samsung Cloud, such as contacts, calendars, photos, videos, keyboard data, etc., for more than twelve months, the respective content category and its data will be deleted and you will no longer be able to recover that data. Samsung will provide you with 30-day advance notice prior to the deletion of your data. For purposes of this provision, “use” or “used” shall mean accessing, uploading to, or downloading data from Samsung Cloud services. 

&gt; 3.10 If any of your devices have not backed up to Samsung Cloud for more than one year, Samsung reserves the right to delete any backups associated with such device. Note that the backup may include call logs, SMS/MMS, app installation package data, app settings, music and document files, voice recordings, and information on device settings. Samsung will notify you of the backup expiration date. You are entirely responsible for backing up or storing your content or information before the expiration date to avoid loss of your content. Samsung is not liable or responsible for any loss that occurs due to you not taking action to back up or store your content and/or data.

I wonder if it means just things on the Samsung Cloud can be deleted, or whether ""backups associated with you device"" also refers to data backed up with Google, or other cloud services. I don't see why Samsung would have access to that sort of thing, but it straddles a fine line between ""Pay for our service or we'll fuck you up"" and ""Use it or lose it"".

HOWEVER; Bixby, the assistant that I didn't ask for, is slowly, but surely, making me dislike the phone for all the wrong(and unnecessary) reasons! I have nothing against Bixby's existence - it's Samsung's thing and it's existence is not something which has bothered me or should bother me at all. 

And a part of me gets it; it's a technology which is innovative, a very valid entry into a highly competitive scene. 

But why can't I, as a user of the device, have the option to not use it? Since buying the phone, earlier this year, I have probably had to disable the Bixby Home Screen on 10 different occasions after Samsung having enabled it by itself again. 

Samsung - take, the, hint!

The Bixby button is a different thing entirely. After the warranty runs out I'll definitely deactivate that button mechanically. Which is a weird thing to have to do. I do use Google Assistant sometimes, even though it's just for general curiosity about the technology itself, and its advances. 

The Bixby has a very different status in my books, as well as other Samsung users, probably. Having the Bixby repeatedly pushed on me like this means that I will never, ever, open it intentionally, not even for the sake of curiosity! Which can't be good for a technology that you want people to see.

I have a Samsung Galaxy s5 that I just received as a manufacturer's warranty replacement about a month ago. I flashed Lineage OS 15.1 on the phone as soon as I got it. It started acting up and boot looping last night, as well as having almost every process crash constantly, so I did a full factory wipe and re-flashed it last night.

Today, I am constantly getting the `android.process.acore keeps stopping` flashing on my screen, it's so quick that I don't even have time to read it. I have tried almost everything that I could find online to stop this issue. I've disabled contacts, I've cleared the cache and data from the contacts app, i removed permissions from the contacts app, I remove contact permissions from google (since it was having me restore my google backup when I set the phone up again), and it continues to flash. There's nothing listed for 'contact storage' so I'm unable to disable that. If I go to Settings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Privacy Guard -&gt; 3-dot menu -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Personal &gt; 3-dot menu &gt; and click on contacts storage, it shows me that 'read contacts' has been used 1646 times, and  in the next menu, messaging, messages has been used 10k+ times, and phone services has been user 10k+ times.

I have been using iPhones previously for the last 4 years, with the latest one being my iPhone 8 Plus.

The Note9 is still very overwhelming as there are SO many more features I get when compared to an iPhone.

So far it is very fast a fluent, but I do get some very tiny stutters in games such as PUBG. This is probably more to do with the game's optimisation and not due to the Note's performance as it is a beast overall.

6. Color customization in the actual keyboard without the use of 3rd party software

I don't know of any of those are even possible but it doesn't hurt to dream or inspire. I could use Gboard or Swiftkey but at least the stock keyboard keeps your data on the phone.

9lxul7,"To set the context , I have been a Note 4 then Note 7 user. After which I was forced to downgrade to S7 edge. This year, I moved to the Note 9 , 8gb, 512 model. So yes, I upgrade once every 2 years

As a fairly experienced Note user, I was expected nothing major , just incremental improvements but I was pleasantly surprised when it was not.

I can say that this has been my largest upgrade since I have started using smartphones back in 2010 with a Iphone 3gs. 

Things that surprised me

1. The speed and fludity of Note 9

I love the Note series, but when I switched over from the iphone 4s to Note 4, the main thing I noticed was the horrible lag. Old time Note 4 users probably remember the delay when multitasking or when taking a photo and tapping on the gallery. It didn't help that I was the type of user who ran all sort of apps in the background, many with permissions for usage data access, device admin, notification access tc.

To give you a taste, I run Tasker + various plugins, IFTTT, almost all the good lock apps,  One handed operation+ (before that I was using third party apps), etc. 

I'm also a smart home person and have multiple apps pertaining to that and heavy user of Google assistant.  The same setup in S7 edge made it lag a lot.

Note 9 is the first phone that is not phased by all this. Maybe its the 8gb ram, maybe it optimization but for once, I had a phone that could do everything and not lag. In fact, I see lag only in 2 situations - sometimes when I charge up and it tries to upgrade a lot of apps. I also think some of the good lock apps, do cause bixby voice to wake up slowly, but I'm not a big bixby fan.

For further context, I have not done any optimization like package disablers etc and yet the Note 9 is amazing

&amp;#x200B;

2. The big beautiful screen means I'm using the S-pen , netflix more

I have to admit I have never really used the spen regularly in the past. But I find myself using Note 9 a lot more. It's not just the blue tooth capabilities but rather because the screen is big enough that writing notes seems to make more sense.

I also find myself using the split screen function a lot more, again courstery of the bigger screen

I have relatively poor eyesight, so I always found the Note screens small for watching netflix etc, but it seems somewhere around the time of Note 8/9 the screen became big enough I find myself watching netflix a lot more now, even though when I'm at home I can easily cast it to my tv.

&amp;#x200B;

3. 512gb +SD card gives you a ton of freedom

I always carry a SDcard... that carries around all my photos. I do use dropbox and google photos to sync photos but I like the security of a local files. When I was forced to download grade to a s7 edge i was pissed. 64gb was not enough space for me, i had tons of apps and 1 game and kept running out of space. I suspect part of the reason why my S7 edge was slow was also it didnt have much disk space and i was constantly clearing things out.

With my 512gb Note 9, I have no such worries. I even copied everything out of my sdcard into the phone memory and no longer use a SD card (perhaps this is another reason why things are so speedy). 

&amp;#x200B;

4. Comments on battery life

Given that I run so many apps, I was not expecting amazing battery life. Still I currently can get 5 hr SOT and 15 hours total time when going from 80% to 40%. That's actually quite impressive. Since I'm using only 40-50% of the full capacity. This is without optimising battery life. 

&amp;#x200B;

5. Camera and misc

I'm not much of a camera person, but i was comparing night scenes with my S7 edge the other day and the difference was excuse the pun - like day and night. There might be better cameras but Note 9 is good enough for me. 

I've played around with Dex but it is not for me.

&amp;#x200B;

6. Software features

People on reddit, cry for stock. But at the cost of giving up secure folder? No thanks. Secure folder is used by me to store all my bank apps, my password manager etc. 

I also currently rock adhell3 (amazing ad blocker that doesnt use battery) and navigation gestures (which maximises screen estate), all apps and features that let you enjoy the max out of the big beautiful screen the Note 9 has.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall Samsung Note 9 looks to be much better than the sum of it's parts. In a way the Note 9 is the ultimate evolution of Galaxy phones since the S6/7 in terms of hardware and software. S10 will be exciting but likely going to be a flawed product as Samsung irons out the kinks in the new technologies employed like inscreen fingerprint scanners and foldable screens. I still remember the early fingerprint sensors in Samsung phones were the horrible swipe type...

In fact, I find Samsung's Iris and face recognition technologies still fairly hit or miss.....and they have had at least 2 years to figure it out.... 

I can heartily recommend the Note 9.

My iPhone 6s is starting to die out on me. Details aside, I’m considering going Samsung.

Some things I would like to know:

- I use iTunes to organize my MP3s. I greatly prefer having the music directly on my phone as most streaming services don’t have my favorite artist (Akino Arai). How does Android OS handle music? Would I need to download a particular app?

- I work retail with cellphones. I’ve activated and troubleshooted basically every make and model as of the last two years, and hot damn do I see a lot of spamware on Android OS. Between apps that place ads everywhere to intrusive programs that change how the phone boots up, I’ve seen tons of things. Only on Android, not on iOS.

9mduyj,"I'm writing to see if my issues with the earphones are just mine or if other users have experienced similar issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I often run using my gear icons and bought them for this purpose. However I sweat and sometimes the sweat I guess gets into the earphones and it causes sound imbalance in the earphones. I didn't see this issues pop-up in reviews before I bought them. I had the earphones replaced by the Samsung store 3 times and this morning I applied for a replacement a 4th time after the sound imbalance. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I first bought the earphones, I asked the staff to give me information about the product, they gave me the wrong information, as in described the ambient noise feature incorrectly and the type of charger the case uses. Anyways, today I asked the staff if I could speak to the store manager to discuss what I can do once my warranty comes to an end (it ends in february) because I've faced this issue several times (maybe I can trade in, extend warranty or get store credit etc etc.), however they said I have to speak to the technical support manager, I asked whether he's in today and they said no, so I asked when will he be in and the staff simply replied ""I don't know"". I persisted for the staff to find out when he will be in and they went to the back and come back and said ""he should be in tomorrow, but we don't know when he will come in, he's a very busy man with his meetings and work."".

&amp;#x200B;

I explain why I wanted to speak to the manager and the staff simply said ""he won't be able to help you, he won't extend you warranty or anything like that. He will tell you what we will tell you and that's to just call the samsung careline. They proceeded to write the number on a small piece of paper and just passed to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure If I'm alone in facing this type of customer service or whether it's the norm to be dealt with like this. Even first when I was interested in buying the earphones, I went to another branch and they treated me poorly as well for wanting to test the earphones before buying it. I'm currently residing in Malaysia and felt that Samsung has had poor service over its branches here, not sure about other countries. ",samsung,2018-10-08 10:58:11

Scrolling on these phones is NOT smooth at all. Text gets blurry when scrolling and images also get blurry and some colors such as blue and black even ""ghost"". Why is this a problem in 2018 ???

&amp;#x200B;

When I'm scrolling, regardless of the speed, regardless of the content - I don't care if it's 100 4K images one under another, there should be 0 blur, no framerate drops, whatsoever or nothing at all. All the text and images should be cristal clear the whole time you're scrolling and the framerate should never drop below 60-70 fps. I mean these are 1000$ phones after all.

And yes, this problem is universal, I have the S8 as I said, which has it, I owned a S8 Plus Exynos for a week which also had it, in fact the Exynos edition of the S8 plus was VISIBLY slower than my snapdragon and now my new Note 9 has it too.

9mmmjo,Whenever I watch mobile tech videos on YouTube (especially Samsung based or even iPhone based videos) there're always comments about Samsung phones lagging after 3-6 months or a year after. Of course there's that one person joking about the phone exploding or catching fire but that's just someone using a dead joke/meme. And then there are a few people disputing those claims by saying that has been solved in 2012/2013. I'm really doubtful that 'lag' happens very often to flagship phones but also curious about it. Is there any truth on those claims and how much of an issue is it? I'm asking because it's been eight years since the last time I used a Samsung phone (Wave w/ Bada OS) and I upgraded from iPhone 6 and BlackBerry Priv to Note 9 a month ago.

A few days after I sent it in to them I got an email saying I would be charged back the $250 that I had been credited because my phone failed to meet the requirements. They noted ""display does not function"" however it obviously did and they even sent me photos of the phone front and back where on the front the display is fully on and working.

I filed a claim and called them, the lady I spoke to said, ""Yeah it looks like it's fine, I think we made a mistake **this happens fairly often**"" and she made a ticket for me.

One month goes by, no response, 2 months no response, I call and they say it'll be a few more days. 3 months, nothing, I call again, they say it's still being checked. Finally today I contact them and am relentless that I get some answers. It's been 4 months.

9myegk,"1: No notches. Honestly, the worst trend smartphones have ever had in their past is the damn notches. if we don't have the technology to make a full edge to edge screen, then we should start to develop towards it instead of going towards alternatives such as notches or motorized cameras. technology is advancing quite fast in this era of development, in my opinion,it's worth waiting for some breakthrough tech to come up like a camera under the pixels of the screen, which turn off when the camera is activated. or even the pixels themselves acting like sensors for light and the whole screen works as a camera. It's better to move towards that with reducing bezels instead of notches.

&amp;#x200B;

2: HEADPHONE JACK. i know a lot of great phones such as the iphone X, Oneplus 6T, Mate 10 pro or even the google Pixel 3 are eliminating the headphone jack, it's not a useful thing to do, all it does is adds more problems. I've done some research on the audio quality of the USB C cables and the headphone jack input cables, TTRS or TRS, Both input a much higher quality audio than the USB C because they've been designed for specific constructions for a complete audio spectrum (has parts for every enhancement) the tip,ring, and sleeve which all have a different contribution to the sound quality hand have been optimized for it. The USB C isn't adapted for sound and audio quality and needs a lot of development to reach the level of the TRS cables. wireless connections put a limit to the headphones you can use, and dongles don't improve quality.

Extra: since Samsung is a gigantic company, producing everything from refrigerators to smartphones to TVs.

Some users have posted solutions using YouTube Vanced but I don't want to use another app for this problem. We have paid premium price for a premium device and an official solution should be the only answer to this problem.

9n7jth,I've seen a lot of people talk about having phones with burn in on their screens and had them replaced for free at ubreakifix or by samsung through Samsung premium care with their original warranty being expired. I called samsung and ubreakifix and they both said I'd be paying the $99 deductible to get it fixed. I don't get why I'd be paying when I have my screen at 50% brightness and have no damage on my phone. Shouldn't it be considered a mechanical issue?

I've got a projector a couple of weeks ago, and Chromecast yesterday, and I tried to watch an anime from my tablet, but as you could guess from the fact that I'm posting here, I couldn't find a good way to have subtitles casted as well.

Google Home, and the tablets own casting feature cuts the display in half. (shows subs, but it's a bad experience)
Samsung Smart View can't find any Samsung Tvs.
Localcast and all the other casting apps don't show the subs.
VLC doesn't even show the casting button (don't know why), but this very question was asked of them and they don't support this.

https://samsungpromotions.com/galaxyupgrade/ explicitly names Samsung.com, Best Buy, and AT&amp;T as eligible for the double-value-trade-ins, so no problems there. But they have a 4th button for ""All Other Retailers"", which has basically the same instructions of all the other ones except the step when you get the ""rebate"" - Download Shop Samsung App, register, ensure trade in phone meets their eligibility requirements, ship trade in phone to them, etc. 

In the app, they have several retailers and carriers listed in a dropdown, but then they have an Other option as well. Again, this seems to imply that I can buy the phone from ANY retailer or carrier (some which have much better prices than others), and as long as my trade in device is approved and I buy the phone within the specified dates I can get the double trade in value promotion. The only difference would be instead of getting the rebate immediately at checkout as with Samsung, AT&amp;T, and Best Buy, I'd get it after the trade in device is sent in and approved?

Hey Guys, I need your help. My Phone just randomly died a few days ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I was watching some Videos and after that I went to sleep. As always, I charged my phone while I'm sleeping. I've been doing that since I got the phone last year. The battery never seemed to be damaged by that.    

When I woke up and I took my phone to check if I got any messages. I unplugged my phone from the charging cable and noticed that the red LED wouldn't turn off. Pressing the Home button, the power button or anything else caused no response. I thought it was a system crash but I couldn't even force restart my phone. It doesn't seem to boot up in safety mode either. I didn't charge my phone after this happened to let the battery life run out to make sure the phone is oof    

Two days after that the red LED turned off. I assume the battery life was over at that time. Once I noticed that I've been charging my phone for about 2 hours before trying to boot it up again. Yet again, no response. I couldn't force restart.    

It's been 3 days now and my phone still appears to be dead. Is it really dead or can I fix it?    

I own this phone since November last year and it was in unopened packaging. I dropped it only once 6 months ago. I didn't download much and only from trusted sources so I doubt there is a virus on my phone. It never ran really hot.

&amp;#x200B;

9nyib2," Personally, I believe that the status bar (the bar on top) and the navigation bar are completely unnecessary and take away A LOT from the screen and experience. Which is why I figured out a way to utilize your entire screen without costing you productivity too much. 

The first thing that you want to do is enable the fingerprint sensor gestures as well as the one-handed mode gesture. After that you want to go to developer options and enable USB debugging.

Download ABD: [https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip)

(you should also have the Samsung drivers installed)

(I will not go into detail on how to use ABD but I will try to make it short and easy: Extract ABD to your C drive. Connect your phone to your computer. Open Command Prompt and go the ABD folder. The command for that is “cd” followed by the path. For example: “cd C:\\ABD” . Once you’re in the ABD directory, you want to type “abd devices” in command prompt. Look at your phone, a message should pop up asking you to confirm, you want to click ok on that one. Once that’s done and your device is recognized, you can proceed to the things below)

&amp;#x200B;

After that you want to download something called System UI Tuner from the Play Store, followed by something called Gesture Control. 

System UI Tuner will allow you to hide the status bar everywhere. However, I personally like to have the status bar ONLY on my home screens. As for in apps, I don’t want it there as it is completely useless. Once you open System UI Tuner you want to follow the steps it tells you. Once it’s time to grant permissions, which it will also tell you, you will need copy paste these 3 commands in the command prompt ABD window that you should have opened by now. Here they are:

adb shell pm grant com.zacharee1.systemuituner android.permission.WRITE\_SECURE\_SETTINGS

adb shell pm grant com.zacharee1.systemuituner android.permission.PACKAGE\_USAGE\_STATS

adb shell pm grant com.zacharee1.systemuituner android.permission.DUMP

&amp;#x200B;

DO NOT DISONNECT YOUR PHONE YET

Once that’s done you should be able to use System UI Tuner. Go to the tweaks &gt; Immersive Mode and you want to click on the Status Bar checkbox. This will now hide the status bar (you can still access it by swiping down on top of the screen). Now to make it visible only on your homescreens, where it says App Specific, you want to Enable that, enable the Blacklist right below it and right below the Blacklist you want to click on Select Apps. Scroll down and find your launcher name and select it.(Mine for example is Nova Launcher so I find Nova Launcher and click on it) Now your status bar will only be visible on the home screen. Any other app that you open it won’t be there. You can enable the status bar for any other app you want by the way, the same way you enabled it on the home screen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now you want to open Gesture Control and follow the instructions once again, you will have to enable its accessibility service and then for the permissions, you will have to copy paste this code in the command prompt window:

adb shell pm grant com.conena.navigation.gesture.control android.permission.WRITE\_SECURE\_SETTINGS

&amp;#x200B;

Once that’s done, you can go inside the app disable the original navigation bar and do whatever you want pretty much. What I did was increase the left and right sensitivity, change some of the gestures, disable others, I also disabled the vibration feedback cuz it annoys me. Oh and I also moved the pill slightly up. You can pretty much do this however you want. If you’re new to this it will take some tweaking until you get it just right. This is basically android Ps gesture navigation.

I’ve used this setup for months now and can honestly say that I wouldn’t be able to live without it. The default status bar and navigation bar take too much space and make the phone feel like a cheap piece of garbage while with this it truly feels premium. Hope this helps.

I’ve tried a couple hacks found on message boards- changing  stuff in settings and reinstalling apps. Nothing works. I have to turn on the TV to warm it up, so to speak, about five minutes before anyone plans to watch something.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently realized that it's possible to display a streamed content from Popcorn time directly on my TV (I have a Samsung smart tv KS7000).

The thing is that everything seems to work fine on Popcorn time's side (it shows that the movie is streamed on my TV) but nothing happens on the TV's side. The source doesn't seem to be recognized and I cannot find my PC (with the popcorn time application launched) in the list of sources on my TV.

So my question is whether there is any specific option I should look for in my TV or any application I should download (such as a specific video player) to be able to find the source and hence watch the video?

I am assumed so because if you read the output on a standard Samsung smart charger, its output does list 9volt which is equivalent to QC2 (QC3=12v) and allows fast charging. You have to use a 'fast charge' compliant charger to ever achieve 'fast charge'. Now the strange thing is I bought one of [these](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/8-in1-USB-Detector-Voltmeter-Ammeter-Power-Capacity-Tester-Voltage-Current-Meter/113226483312?_trkparms=aid%3D555017%26algo%3DPL.CASSINI%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20180905084510%26meid%3D62de713bf4aa49bbaa1beda30dd36821%26pid%3D100505%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D1%26%26itm%3D113226483312&amp;_trksid=p2045573.c100505.m3226) which only ever shows the output voltage of the stock Samsung Charger as 5volt, even when the screen shows 'Fast Charging'. So wondering why/how the 9volts gets switched to?

I have another QC3 12volt cig adapter in my car, and it too only ever outputs 5volt for fast charging. So it seems Samsung only ever equates fast charging to more amps, rather higher voltage. I had read that QC was a way of switching 2x3.7volt cells in Samsung batteries (usually in parallel), in series for charging at 9volt. Anyone confirm how Samsung achieves fast charging?

9oqkpr,"I bought the S7 Edge+ about two years ago, and when I got it the phone was just stupid fast.  Everything opening nearly instantly and I loved it.  However, in the past 6 months the phone has gotten slower and slower, to the point where I can't answer calls, and it's driving me crazy.  

I'm more of a business power user, so I use it primarily for communication and the likes.  I only have a handful of apps installed, such as:

* Evie launcher (I've also used Apex, Nova, Go, and the default Samsung)
* Spotify
* Keep
* MyMail
* OurGroceries
* Textra
* Amazon
* Business calendar
* Calendar snooze
* Fitbit
* Ecobee
* Liftmaster (garage door thing)
* Lyft
* Mint
* Starbucks
* A file sync tool
* My bank

I've disabled/removed the games, and unneeded apps like NFL, Slacker Radio, Handcom office, etc.

The problem that happens very often is I will be listening to music, or texting, or using Google maps, and someone will call me ... and **the phone will lag so much that the call screen will never appear**.  I can hear the phone ringing, but the screen is black.  There is no way to see who is calling or answer it.  Obviously, this is a bit of a problem if I'm waiting for a work call.

I've factory reset the phone at least 6 times, removed nearly all the apps, and it still happens.  I even got a new S7 from Verizon (warranty) and it does the same thing!

Is it just me?  It makes me a little mad that the phone is pretty much useless after just two years.  Yeah, it would be nice to upgrade, but I don't feel like shelling out $800 for a new phone to solve a problem that didn't exist a few years ago.

9or4uv,"Hi Guys,

I recently was provided a Samsung S9 for work managed by Meraki MDM and I just noticed that when I go into settings I do not have the ""Cloud and Accounts"" section listed on the settings page it seems to be replaced with a section called ""Accounts"". 

&amp;#x200B;

If I select the ""Accounts"" section I can then drill down to the ""Backup and Restore"" section but once there I only see the following text grayed out:

Samsung Account: Backup service not available prevented by security policy

and

Google Account: Backup service not available

&amp;#x200B;

I've checked our Meraki (KNOX) setup and there is no option blocking any type of cloud backups or any similar restrictions in place.

&amp;#x200B;

If I navigate to the Google section in the S9's settings menu  and select the Backup option the ""Back up to Google drive"" is grayed out, I can turn it on but it does not stay activated and keeps on turning it self off.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been researching this problem for a while now with no solution, I even tried to remove/re-add my Google and Samsung account with no change.

&amp;#x200B;

I can however locate the ""Samsung cloud"" settings page and initiate a manual Samsung backup to cloud without issue.

&amp;#x200B;

I've reached out to our carrier and they advised they do not block any features, Samsung KNOX and MERAKI have no options to specifically block these features either and their phone support was unable to provide any solutions to this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone seen this problem before? any ideas to resolve?

&amp;#x200B;

There's a new battery issues in the SGS3, mine specifically is a frontier, no more than 2 months old. I am far from the only one with this issue, just google ""Samsung gear S3 charge issue"" and find some forum post and go to the most recent, I started having this issue about the same time as the rest (2-3 days ago)

There is no obvious cause for this issue, location services is randomly turning itself on, or at the very least no longer automatically turns itself off after a workout (run specifically). I used to have it last at least one day, I heard this used to do 3-4 from looking at old forum posts. I got it to last from waking up (7 AM) until 10:30 today before I was forced to charge it as I keep my charger with me... you never know. 

Location services has made no difference, if anything decreasing the battery life, as yesterday it went 6 hours instead of nearly 4. There's some automatic reporting features I have since disabled which I will keep you all up to date on. I'm a PC power user, not an android one, and definitely not a Samsung one, so I'm still learning the reins and how to full leverage every ""feature"" or should I say ""battery drainer"" the Samsung has at the moment.

Any ideas will help, if anyone else has had this issue PLEASE help spread the word, and if you guys could, tag @UnboxTherapy on twitter with #SamsungSGS3BatteryGate and get this ball rolling!

My best guess is that both ""cameras/lenses"" work as a unit and you can´t select just one.

9p04k3,"Purchased 2 Samsung Note 8 phones in November of last year.

On both devices, experienced the issue wherein if the battery died, the device would no longer accept a charge (I manage a cell phone store, know it's dead). I called Samsung customer service and they had me send in my device for repair - swapped the battery, no biggie. 

However, this happened 3 more times on my device and 2 more times on my Wife's device in the course of 6 months. I also noticed that a lot of my customers with the S8 and Note 8 series devices were coming in with the same issue. So I knew it wasn't environmental, it was a bad MBR issue (didn't cut off power at 5% like every phone since forever).

On the 4th warranty call August 8th, I talked with a rep who stated that just to stop with all the issues that they would be sending me out a new Note 8 instead of simply replacing the battery on the device. I was satisfied with that, and accepted the terms given.

However, 3 weeks went by and I didn't receive the replacement. I looked at the tracker, and they had received it almost immediately. So there was no reason for the delay. I called into care again, and was told I would be contacted within 3 business days with a resolution. No call.

Instead I was mailed a refurbished Samsung S8.

I called care again, explaining the situation, and was told I would receive a call from a supervisor in 48 hours. No call. 

I called again, asked for a supervisor, and was told I would be contacted by THEIR supervisor in 48 hours. No call.

3 more calls, I'm not making this up. I went as high as the call center COULD go. Waited on the phone for 2:02:14 before I spoke with a person who told me that I would not receive my replacement until they got their S8 back. So they sent me a label via email.

I asked the person what kind of device I would be getting back at this point. He told me a refurbished Note 8. 

This is 10 weeks later.

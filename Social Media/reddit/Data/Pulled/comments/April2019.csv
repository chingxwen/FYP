8,"In 2017 Samsung released the Gear S3, and in 2018 the only major changes with the Galaxy watch were battery life, Bixby, auto work out detection, and water-proofing. If you get a Galaxy watch now, it is pretty likely that there will be a new one around late August, and there could be a new design since we've had this one for 2 years, but it's just as likely that the changes will be small. In the meantime, I've had my Galaxy watch and Note 9 since launch, and I recommend it highly. ",2019-03-31 10:35:12

It allways happens with me ,I've been a Samsung fan my whole life but this time it didn't cut it ,all of my samsung phones lagged when they were six months old even this one did.",2019-03-31 10:47:22
11,I'm Experiencing this issue on my note 9 only have the phone going on 6 months now it seems to me every now update is more demanding on the battery especially for the older Samsung phones every Samsung phone I ever had within a 6 months period and new update phone's battery life  declines a lot and performance its just Samsung's way of saying buy our new phones. ,2019-03-31 10:49:44
12,"If you're happy with the 10s Max and it just has one issue the easiest solution would just be to take it to an Apple store and get it fixed. Switching ecosystems ""can"" be awkward. 

That being said...I switched from Apple to Android about a year ago and haven't looked back. Once you push through that awkward phase it is SOOO worth it.

I thought customizability was something I wasn't going to use because I didn't care about different fonts or icon styles. But it is SOOO much more than that. I am really happy that I can do what I want with my phone.

Plus, (personal opinion) I like to be on the cutting edge of technology and I feel that Samsung is really trying to give that to the consumer. 

There are bugs and hiccups along the way, and sometimes I have felt like throwing my phone against the wall...but overall I don't know if I could go back to iOS. At least right now.  ",2019-03-31 10:51:40

14,"I've just (last week) switched from an XS Max to an S10+. I also got Samsung Buds (my airpods batteries were shot anyway) and a Samsung Watch Active (I had the AW Series 4). So far I'm pretty happy. I have the Sennheiser TW buds and they sound better and connect better with Samsung's BT 5 than they ever did with the iPhone. I was having BT connection issues since the last iOS update. I was also having Pocket Casts and Audible randomly closing on me, so my overall experience with the S10+ is better. It is lighter in weight, the screens are about the same, the under screen fingerprint sensor is not as good as face unlock but Android has lots of options to keep the phone unlocked when in range of the watch, BT headphones etc. I have always used Google services a lot which probably helps the transition. I don't use Snapchat. The customisation options in Android are amazing coming from an iPhone. The camera's are about the same level. Overall I'm happy and won't be switching back any time soon.",2019-03-31 11:45:01
15,Official samsung one. Looks really good.,2019-03-31 11:56:38
16,"Sounds like a personal problem. I've had S8 for two years until I traded it up for the Note 9 and that phone didn't lag. There are always one or two people like you that swears to Samsung phones lagging after a brief usage while everyone else is talking about the nonexistent lag even after years of usage. If you're having issues on S9 others aren't having, what makes you think you won't have the same issues using the iPhones? That is, if you're not just fabricating the whole story and actually telling the truth. ",2019-03-31 12:00:33
17,"You're talking about the face unlock? Wow. Way to take that one flaw and blow it out of proportion. S10 offers so many ways to unlock the phone, so the flaw in face unlock is not detrimental to the unlocking security. If S10 was like the iPhones and was stripped of all other unlocking security features such as fingerprint sensor, then I'd take your comment more seriously. No one will use the face unlock in favor of the fingerprint sensor, anyways. 

Also, when you are just generally talking about the security on S10 being poor, you should be talking about the overall security of the phone. Unfortunately for you, Samsung phones with Knox are more secure than iPhones and other Android devices.

18,I just disable Samsung pay on the home screen. I only use it from the lock screen anyways.,2019-03-31 12:13:54
19,"I just got my beautiful S10  prism blue it's an incredible device...everything from the camera to the speed and oh my that screen!!! I didn't come from an iPhone but instead a moto z play which was really on its last leg. I was hesitant to get my first Samsung phone in seven years but the UI is smooth and yeah it's got some bloatware but thus far I haven't noticed any issues. 

I was lucky to get mine brand new for only 650 from Costco as they were running a special for tmobile customers. The hardware is great and it's incredibly well designed and built. This device just works and it works flawlessly.  Again the camera is phenomenal...the live focus feature is easy and great. Battery so far seems great as well...probably about 6 hours screen time. It's just a solid solid device in case you were still debating ",2019-03-31 12:13:54

26,"I switched from an X and AW4 to S10+ and Galaxy Watch a bit over a week ago. No regrets at all so far. Been with Apple since the 3G, with a few visits to Android, but never stayed more than a few months, because I couldn't help myself when something new came along. Now I have a mortgage and other debts I can't afford to chop and change phones every 6 months anymore. The leaks for what the next iPhone will look like have put me off wanting one too, so there shouldn't be any temptation to go back this year either.

Things are a lot better now with the software so I'm going to stick it out. App quality has improved too in recent years from what I've seen. Bit of a learning curve with all the extra things you can do with the phone settings, but worth the time to get the hang of it.

The finger print scanner works about 98% of the time for me. Still waiting on the latest firmware update that apparently improves things. when it works I'd say it's on par with Face ID for unlock speed, maybe slightly behind, but you're not going to notice unless you're doing side by side comparisons. Still using my airpods and they work great, but I will be getting a set of the Samsung buds sometime soon.

I used keychain for my passwords, and luckily I still have an iPad, and MacBook Pro, so I can access my passwords if I can't remember any. Just have to find the best option for saving them with this phone (Samsung, Google, or 3rd party).

I'm now waiting for my telco to get the S10 5G so I can get my free upgrade. I'll miss the nice look of the ceramic black, seeing as silver and gold are the only two options that will be available here. Dropping from 512Gb storage to 256 won't matter, there's no way I'll go anywhere near close to filling that, let alone 512.",2019-03-31 12:51:39

It broke the dark/low-contrast theme I was using before so I had to customize it by switching to the Default theme and then converting it to Night Mode, then changing the icons from the default white. Also not a huge fan of the back/home/all apps buttons remaining on screen always, since one of my big phobias with Samsung phones is screen burn-in and that's a really quick way to guarantee it happening, but I changed that row to gestures instead of buttons and I guess that might work out?

I also lost my Bixby Briefing alarm, which I really liked for my weekend alarms because it gave me weather and news updates, which were nice to listen to when I was lying in bed in the morning.

78,Samsung phones always drop in price rather drastically after a few months. The 5G model won't affect it.,2019-04-01 07:47:11
79,I was more confused by the Apple logo on the Samsung subreddit. I kept thinking the app watch glitching because I'm subscribed to both. I'm ashamed at how many times I clicked off and on the subreddit waiting for it to change lol,2019-04-01 08:01:04
80,"Sorry about that but wow I didn't know Samsung cover MicroSD failure with their replacement program, especially 4-year-old MicroSDs.

81,Samsung help me figure out the long press thing. The prompt to ask Bixby vs GA only came up when I long pressed while the Wearables app was open. (It could also be that that was the first time I long pressed with the screen on.),2019-04-01 08:56:58
82,"Note: i I'm not a normal user, after my warranty is off i tend togo wild on my stuff, my plantronics back beat fit took 2 years of showers nothing happened, my gears s3 never comes out my hands besides for charging, the iconx too. My note 8 went to the sea and had a wonderful time (like 3 or 4  times of like 7 to 15 minutes) even played music under water music and played with the S pen.  Now my nephew went once with his one week new S9+ and the phone still a drawer 9 months later, it died at the spot, (no no insurance on case you wondering), my other nephew treat his gear S3 like a lady even use a microfiber to clean his phone and watch but his gear s3 died like 8 months after he got it and Samsung took care of everything.

84,"I got the same thing. Tried to communicate with customer service about it and get some additional info, but they were completely useless (it said I was chatting with a real person, but I'm not convinced).

What really ticks me off is that Samsung's official business page (or whatever it is called) is selling them on Amazon. So they aren't available through the Samsung website where you can use your ""preorder reward"", but you can pay full price for them on Amazon, where they are being sold directly by Samsung.

94,"I don't have any experience with Samsung tablets, but maybe consider getting one of their watches. The Galaxy Watch Active is their newest watch centered around fitness capabilities and being sleek and lightweight.

Either way dont keep that defectice phone, do charge back if all fails but make sure to get some kind of evidence going forward. Try emailing them first, if they dont respond(which i doubt) then at least u have evidence of you trying to get things fixed in the right way.

101,"I cannot recall ever hearing or reading about a single solitary good thing when it comes to Samsung customer support. Like not once. Regarding any device or question. 

I5 makes me wonder what exactly they DO that warrants this service to even exist. Like, they always tell you it's your fault, or that they will not replace a faulty device or honor a warranty. And the shit I've read about people's experience with their trade-in program is the stuff nightmares are made of. 

How in the world are they allowed to blatantly just screw over so many customers and basically rob them of their money and devices? 

Can anyone explain this? Yes, I'm aware the negative experiences are the most vocal, but again, I've not ever in my life heard of anyone actually getting a positive result from their customer service.",2019-04-01 13:41:48

No one treats me any differently or says shit to me regardless of what I am using. Im convinced the majority of these people are either imagining they are being slighted when they aren’t or are just making this shit up. Only other possibility is they are sending out some kind of powerful weird inferiority complex vibe that is so strong it makes people look down on them for using non-Apple products. Again, this has never once happened to me using any device of any kind, I’ve never even heard of anyone relating a story like this to me IRL. It only happens to people on Internet forums and on Facebook for some mysterious reason.

128,"Okay, I had to double check and correct myself, but it seems as though the firmware version was a G950US version. It was released in March 2018. I flashed that firmware. My hope was to flash a firmware version that would work and not lock the boot loader. When it flashed correctly I was surprised. There was an exploit that lets you get to the contacts app from the emergency services during the wizard set up.

I managed to use that method (without a sim card some how) and get to the contacts app. From there you can send messages (or try to) and send links to apps. If you go to a YouTube link it will open the YouTube app. Surprisingly in the terms and services section of the YouTube app you will open the terms in a web browser. If you have access to the web browser you have access to APK files. By default my firmware was only opening the Samsung Internet app. However luckily Firefox has an APK. Installing the Firefox APK gave me access to changing my default browser to none other than the Google Chrome browser from there I downloaded a third party apk app that was designed to give you the option to access any app on the phone without being on the Galaxy's main UI. So I went to the settings app cleared and turned off cloud storage syncing to the original account which no one including my buddy even knew about. I disabled Google Play services and added a brand new Google account and rebooted this made the install wizard just push on through thinking the new Google account was the admin account.

Some issues I ran into: in order to access emergency calling you need a connection to towers unless that direct emergency call is to 911. Which I didn't want to make our 911 services freak out so I called and told them it was a test call and it was. Problem I had was that the phones sim tray was non existent. So a buddy lended me his tray and I used my personal Verizon sim. This actually caused my account to be locked as the device's IMEI was black listed. So I had to go to Verizon and have my account fixed. So this created the issue of ""if I try to do this again I can't use my personal sim so how will I access emergency services again? For some odd reason the phone let me do so without a SIM card.

Here is where things get odd. Without the firmware version I got the phone actually would crash the wizard install app constantly. I got a tad discouraged thinking this meant that the phones current firmware version was designed to patch the exploit. So u actually reset the phone and for some reason it knew the Google account I added was there and the wizard install app decided to push on through to the ""add a Gmail account portion."" The next issue I had was it would read the Gmail but it wouldn't actually go anywhere. Instead it would say ""adding an account"" but just loop back around to add the account again. So once more I found myself stuck. That is when I decided to try all over again but this time with the older firmware version and entirely knew Gmail account. After a reboot and some hassle it just worked after reboot. Went on through no loops no crashing it just worked.",2019-04-01 20:44:10

169,"Agreed. I just got done chatting with Samsung support. My S10+ was delivered 3/15. If the eCertificate email was supposed to arrive 15 days after delivery of my order, I should have received the email on 3/30. The rep wasn't able to tell me anything other than they were opening a support ticket for me and I would be contacted by a support tech once they have details to share with me. I asked to clarify the timeline and was told I should expect to hear back from them via email within 4 business days. Not a great experience so far, but hopefully I will hear back from them soon and will receive the $130 credit soon as well. 

I was thinking about using the credit to just buy a couple of wireless chargers instead of the buds. Anyone agree / disagree with this decision? It was a little unclear to me as to whether the $130 credit could be used to purchase multiple items or just a single item. If it's just a single item, I'm not sure what I'm going to use it for because I'm not a big fan of earbuds that insert into your ears (my ears are apparently shaped weird and they never stay in).

172,"Samsung is also the only company who can make foldable OLED screens. Huawei's foldable phone uses BOE's screen but apparently BOE is barely able to squeeze out one or two functioning foldable OLED screens. What Huawei showed-off is basically no more than a concept, because they can't actually mass-produce it. Last I heard, Huawei has no choice but to buy Samsung's foldable screens (due to BOE's incapability to produce foldable OLED screens at a volume relevant enough) despite all the childish jabs they've taken at Samsung.

BOE's screen technology (LCD and OLED) came from a Korean company that apparently went bankrupt. Aside from that, Chinese giant corporations are continuously poaching hundreds if not thousands of Korean engineers to help them catch up to the Korean standards when it comes to screens and semi-conductors. Unfortunately, you can only copy and mimic so much and you will never be able to surpass the original creators no matter how many billions of dollars you waste.

The rep I spoke to had no idea how to handle it either and was trying to get me to ""troubleshoot"" the problem. It's not really a troubleshoot issue. Either the battery is operating and it will charge my buds, or it isn't working and it won't charge them more than once. I have a feeling that until more people post about it and vocalize the issue, Samsung wont issue a fix/recall replacement.

Samsung claims the buds have up to 6 hours of use time but people like myself would unplug the device the moment it turns green (because it suggests it's full) but green only means it's above 60% we're only getting about half of that use time. ,2019-04-03 10:37:52

239,If I were you . I would go with Samsung .  Samsung is the best phone company at this moment . It has been kicking ass since Samsung s5 . One Plus is a Chinese company . They got caught sending data to china . Them and Nokia and huawei.  Oneplus 6t is a great phone .  No doubt on that . But it's not as good as Samsung s9 . It has an inferior display . Doesn't  matter if you wish to only have full hd . And they say that the vibration motor on the one plus is a pain in the ass . For me . Privacy and what Samsung gives me are far more important than what oneplus gives you . Always go with the big dogs.  Also the notch might make your experience unpleasant .  And the finger print scanner is still a gimmick on one plus.  While the s9 have it in a very good place on the back ,2019-04-03 11:03:02

244,"I think you should google for ""scientific method"".   
Given that, let's try to summarize:   


Samsung (the producer) is selling a charger with 2 pads. both pads are compatible with qi device but only one is compatible with the watch.  
We asked ourselves if the reason could be the coils' size, but it is not since: quoting you  


""""  there are multiple coils in the larger pad. They overlap which in turn helps the smaller coil get a connection. """"  


So, why is Samsung (the producer again) asking us not to recharge the watch on this pad? maybe because it is not compatible or not fully compatible with the charge qi standard?  


Now please check my other answer where I wrote about the tests I'm doing with a 3rd party wireless charger. Sadly my wattmeter does not work with the samsung 12V 2.1A that comes with the duo pad ",2019-04-03 12:06:45
245,"It is simple, I don't understand how you can be so dense. Samsung wants you to use the designated pad for the watch because it has a smaller coil properly sized for the watch to get a GOOD and EFFICIENT connection. Being able to establish a connection on the larger pad does not make it good or efficient it only proves it is qi compatible.

I'm going to say this one last time. The watch is qi compatible, the limiting factor is purely on coil size. ",2019-04-03 12:20:08

It served me great over all these years, but started to slow down and glitch out around two years ago. I could've probably fixed most of the problems by doing a factory reset and cleaning it up file wise, but I was getting tired of applications I wanted to use not supporting Android 4.0. The final straw was when my banking app stopped supporting 4.0.  
So it was time for an upgrade! I was looking at trying something new with the Huawei P30 pro, but I wasn't fond of the skin they were using, launchers not working great and not supporting rooting.

268,"I'll try to explain it better:

If you look at the watch charger it will say it outputs 5V which is the voltage needed for ""standard"" wireless charge like Samsung calls it.

Qi chargers can output 5W @5V 9W @9V 15W @12V.

Now, if you put a galaxy phone on the qi charger and manually disable the fast wireless charge it will negotiate the 5V profile with the charger. If you leave fast charge enable it will negotiate the 9V profile with the charger.

If you put the watch on the qi charger it will start charging with the 9V profile WHICH IS NOT THE RIGHT PROFILE. So, I'm afraid the watch cannot negotiate the right qi profile when put on a generic qi charger, thus requiring a precise charger.

You can post all the coil images you want but the watch works flawlessly on bigger coil, it simply can't negotiate the right charging profile from what I see.

I seriously hope I made it clear. I'm starting to think this is a language issue and if it's this way it may be my fault since English is not my main language. ",2019-04-03 21:39:11

The S5e is also much thinner and lighter, and should receive an extra year of updates given it's launching with Pie. AndroidPIT also claims that the speakers should be better on the S5e:

""In terms of audio, Samsung relies on AKG's know-how. Even with the Galaxy Tab S4, the audio engineers were allowed to help, but only at a late stage of development. With the Galaxy Tab S5e, Samsung got AKG technicians involved in the development earlier.

302,"tl;dr: Why am I not getting audio from my 4k upscaling Blu-ray player?

Yesterday I received a refurbished Samsung BD-JM63 Blu-ray player with 4K upscaling. I plugged it into my TV (a Samsung NU6900 55"" UHD TV) with an old HDMI cable that I dug out of a box in the garage, and went through the player's setup (which included a firmware update). 

At no point could I get any sound from the player -- I attempted playing several Blu-rays and a couple of DVDs, and while I could see the image just fine, there was no audio. Tried a CD too, and never heard anything.

I fiddled with the player's audio settings (PCM vs. bitstream, etc.), but no sound. Tried the TV's HDMI 1 and HDMI 2 ports, power-cycled everything more than once, ran a factory reset on the player -- no dice.

I plugged the player into a cheapo Element HDTV and had the same issue.

I have not tried the player's optical out yet, mostly because I'd prefer not to use it (and because I don't have an optical cable sitting around at the moment).

More importantly, I'm almost certain that I'm using a 10-year-old HDMI cable, and I'm almost positive that I don't have a newer high-speed / premium / 2.x HDMI cable handy. I'm wondering whether this could be the issue -- that older cables just won't work with this model, even when attempting to play something as low-bandwidth as a DVD or CD. What are the odds that an HDMI 2.0 cable is all I need? Or did I just end up with an unrefurbed refurb?",2019-04-04 07:17:58

This is for the US only. 
Updates for the Samsung S8 and MAYBE the S9 on SPRINT are causing said phones to not receive web based data on their cellular Network.  The update hit the phones, I believe,  on April 1st.  There is currently NO solution for the S8 my Sprint rep says that  Sprint and Samsung are working on a solution but no ETA is available.  Sprint wellll release a patch for the issue as soon as they can. 

Don't go to the Sprint store, fix it shops or Samsung  shops as they have no solution .

The S10 apparently suffers from the same problem but an OTA update cures that problem. 

Dont update th his month if you are on Sprint.

Plus they didn't do any promotions like what Samsung does where you can get the newest flagship for hundreds less than msrp right on release. It should've been priced $100 to $200 less. People who mention the pixel always talk about the camera, besides that, there wasn't anything groundbreaking or special. Personally, the One Plus phones are doing what Google should be doing, or what Nexus used to do. Premium hardware slightly below flagship bolstered by good software at a more accessible price.

The are a few arguments here, one being that maybe Samsung should have advertised it here but on the other (and I agree with this side) the people that care about 5g and the technologies associated with it probably watched the event or at least pay attention to many of the outlets associated with it. 5g is far from mainstream and unless you live in one of the few areas that might have and have the money to burn this phone is not worth it. I used to work retail electronics and if I had to imagine your typical old person coming looking for a nice phone I would recommend the s10e all day long without a doubt. I love that Samsung is still innovating but just like in the day of the s5 when it could read your eyes to scroll the page, the high-end features that these phones are usually years ahead of the crowd, assuming they aren't just one and done feature just like what the s5's eye scrolling.

428,It's not the cameras itself but the software. Samsung screwed up with their software. I use VSCO app or Open camera for selfies or you can go with Gcam. VSCO and Open Cam is easier to use since its directly from the playstore and gcam takes a little tinkering before you actually get it to work right. ,2019-04-05 12:08:12

430,Totally agree it wasn't on my radar for the simple fact that 5g will be a few years probably to be installed in my town I'm betting. Took that long for LTE. For me it's more the specs the bigger screen specifically. Not that big of a deal like I said. This is my first Samsung phone from the Smart phone generation. Can't say I'll ever go back to apple. The A50(think that's what it's called) would from design would have been better for me as I don't use a selfie camera and would love a full screen.  Don't know the specs on that one. I almost got the note 8 before I got my iPhone 7+ regret that decision after getting the his phone. If the note 10 has lots of improvements I'll probably upgrade or do so when the note 11 is out. Then hopefully the fold 3 or 4 has all the tech worked out and had dropped in price.   ,2019-04-05 12:29:40

482,"I jumped from a iPhone XS to the S10. I'm a fan of new tech just like you and do it periodically. Ive never been a fan of the Pixel phones regardless of the clean Android experience because the hardware feels like poor quality. I usually jumped ship back to iOS because the phone either slowed down or app crashes. However this time I have been very pleased at the state of Android. 

Regarding security, I do not think you need a virus blocker or anything. The Samsung internet app is better than Chrome imo because it allows for you to add an adblocker which solves a lot of ad issues. Still not as good as Safari on iOS but much better than anything else on Android. Also the OS security on Android has gotten much better. Steve Gibson on Security Now just did a podcast where he came away very impressed with the latest security updates by Google. 

As for iMessages, there is obviously no clear alternative. I've heard that you can use the Google messages app on both phones and computer but I haven't used it.

and I'm sure that you can use it on a Mac as well. There's also AirDroid, which accomplishes the same thing.

Also, the Samsung ecosystem is pretty cool. I thought that Apple people were kind of over hyping having everything connected until I switched from OnePlus to Samsung.

498,"This is not actually the case, I wasn't buying ti because I was loyal, I bought it because I trusted them to be out for the customer.

&amp;#x200B;

Telling me its ok to build weak flimsy devices because its the customer's fault if it breaks is not ok. Case in point, the cracked screen is not entirely my fault, as it is a device made ridiculously -long- so as to not fit in any standard pocket and it can not be protected by most protectors as it has a rounded screen for no particular reason other than to ""hide"" the phone edges from most viewers who think 1-2mm of Bezel is somehow bad. Its a trick to make you think there is no bezel when there is, its just that the glass is rounded there to make you see a screen still only now you can accidentally click buttons while simply trying to hold your phone.

&amp;#x200B;

Accidents happen, Areyes. My S3 was my first device, and often I only had service when it was in one specific spot in the room and only there. I had to keep it in that one exact spot on top of the mini fridge to get signal at all out here and no there is no other service that would have worked out here at that time. It often got knocked down by the cat or even that time there was a minor earth quake shook the house just enough to knock it down. I used to be weaker than I am now due to health problems, had a weak grasp on things and sometimes the phone would slip. A time when I was out on my bike going through grass, I hit a bump and the strap broke throwing the phone to the ground. These are just examples of the accidents that happened to my S3 and it survived with NO DAMAGE because Samsung made a great device and I loved them for it. I was so happy with it I stuck with Samsung to get my next device.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that the other potential devices cost hundreds more and weren't unlocked or compatible with the service I wanted to get. I found that I was able to get a discount on the S8 I was looking at, and could unlock it after a short time. When I got the device, I was a little disappointed because of how long it was, and the round screen edges, but at the time I didn't think they were terrible things. I bought a phone case for it, and found out that there are no reliable screen protectors for the device because of how the screen is designed, it is unprotectable to the primary way in which screens get cracked due to its round edge and 90% of screens were incompatible with the decent double layer cases.

&amp;#x200B;

It was only later on, months later, when I discovered that the battery can not be easily swapped. As if the phone was designed with a self destruct timer inside it because batteries are always the weakest component and are guaranteed to die within a year or two. Case in point, my battery has now expanded with enough force to push both the back panel off slightly, and make the screen of the phone dent forward in one spot. Now I must take the phone in to have a dangerous procedure done to repair it because Samsung has declared that I can't just walk in to a battery shop, pop the back off, plop the battery down on the table and say ""Hey, I need a new one of these"". A simple procedure for my old phone, you save no space GLUING the battery in, you don't get any added capacity, you don't protect the user any more with a GLUED IN BATTERY. There's no reason of any kind to GLUE a battery in. The fact that they glued the case on was enough to ensure the battery stays inside, and even then the internals show another support piece inside that also holds the battery in place. Why does Samsung feel the need to GLUE a battery in so that it can only be removed by exposing it to a dangerous situation like heating it up? Do they feel they need to make battery replacement so dangerous that it can kill people so as to prevent anyone from replacing their battery? Is it their goal to cause severe injury to anyone who tries to fix their own device? Whats the point of gluing a battery into a sealed device that already contains extra supports of its own for holding a battery inside a sealed confined space? The only reason I can think of, is what I listed above. To make battery replacement a dangerous complicated process that can severely injure people and destroy a device if you are unlucky or if you aren't a professional.

Furthermore, is it still my fault I had health issues causing me to be unable to hold onto my phone perfectly? As you said, I should treat my devices better. You assume that accidents don't happen with that statement. You also forgot to think maybe there is a reason other than negligence that I could have been dropping the device a lot. You just came at me as if its my fault for being careless.

Is Samsung -really- giving people what they want when everyone just goes out and buys a phone protector? Why do they think people want something, and then see everyone go out and undo the things they were given? E.G. Thinner phones are negated by phone protectors. Tool kits are released to help people replace irreplaceable batteries and open up these sealed devices that are ridiculously designed so as to ensure no one can repair it. Replacement batteries are STILL a thing even with the new irreplaceable batteries. Is Samsung going to start banning people who talk about device repair like Apple did to that professional who repairs Apple devices and recovers the data that Apple proclaimed to be impossible to recover? I don't think Samsung would be so petty as to do that, with everything being on record on the internet, and users like me who often screenshot everything and back up website posts on ""the wayback machine"" to prevent censorship. I doubt Samsung would start doing that, but I don't know, I've started losing my faith in them.",2019-04-06 09:33:14

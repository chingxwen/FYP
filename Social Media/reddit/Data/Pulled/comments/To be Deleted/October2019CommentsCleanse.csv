0,"it is just as fluid, it works the same as useing a galaxy watch for comparison and i freakin love it! it was one of the biggest reasons i upgraded to the s10+ because i usually am on my tablet 9/10 because of work and school, and having to just answer and send messages without taking my hands off is super convienient but this is neccisarly new, since samsung flow (and the veteran smart switch app) had already had these options in place, but this is super seamless and way better. the only issue i had, was with one call where the other guy noticed that i might be on speaker phone and couldnt really hear me but that is 1/100 times that i have had an issue. although, i reccomend useing earbuds if you are using it in public",2019-09-30
1,"it just a prefrence for cameras, i believe that the pixels cameras are very good, but just boring for the normal person. iphone cameras to me always looked super good, but when then got unexciting when the 11 pro came out. samsung may have a little bit more contrast and color than a normal camera, but myself, and most people might actually perfer that than a realistic image. Its just pretty to look at and people will like to chose that over any other phone. and oneplus phones are very great! the cameras arent going to be on par with any flag ship on the market right now but its really great camera non-theless and will suit anyones needs. If you really like cameras though, you should of probably just stuck with the pixel. all in all, i dont think you dumb, alot of people like the refreshrate and to me its a gimmic and an unnecessary battery waster, but it looks HELLA nice, but for me i would rather have a bigger batter that lasts, and a higher screen res... and wireless charging!",2019-09-30

13,"I currently run a Note 10+ and an iPhone 11 Pro. The Note is amazing for media consumption. Android does really well with PiP and Split and the large screen is phenomenal for it. Also, for my setup file management is easier on the Note. Want to d/l Usenet, Torrents or files from your Plex server no problem as Android allows background task running. Also, a lot more choices for the apps on Android. You also have the option of expandable storage so you can sync more content. My iPhone is my choice for my social media apps and photography. I find taking and editing pictures more pleasant on iOS. Plus, the quality and quantity of the editing apps combined with iOS color management across apps is superb. For these cases I prefer Apple for its background app management. I get rock solid consistent battery on the go. Where with Android it can be unpredictable. When I first switched I just uploaded my iCloud photos to Google Photos and then deleted the iCloud library backup and turned it off. Kept an archived copy on my server just in case. Now everything just gets backed up to Google and then within Google photos I use the free up device storage after the backup is finished. If you’re like me and really into tech and open minded to both platforms I think you’ll really enjoy it. For support, as a tech literate person, I just learned to figure it out on my own. The curve was relatively small. But, any Samsung forum or reddit is a great choice. Learn how each best suites your certain usage scenarios and learn to utilize it for those. If you have any other questions I’d be glad to assist.",2019-09-30
14,"Was giving a MU8000 recently. I was thrilled as I have an Xbox One X and can finally experience 4K and hdr. However when I go to turn on the uhd color setting for input 1 the screen goes black for 5 seconds then is unable to find the Xbox’s signal. I have a new 2.0 hdmi cable and have enabled 4K and hdr on the Xbox. I’ve also tried toggling YCC 4:2:2 on and off. I’ve reset the tv to factory settings, swapped hdmi inputs and make sure the firmware is up-to-date. Has anyone encounter this before? At the point I’m assuming it’s a hardware issue unless anyone knows additional settings I can adjust. Also does anyone know what the process of repairing a tv out of warrant is like? I’ve had a Samsung tv for the past 10 years and despite the lack of hdr still love the tv. Fingers crossed I can get thus fixed! Thanks for taking the time to read this!",2019-09-30
15,I agree it's priced very high however as it's a unique and niche product for Samsung they can pretty much get away with it as there will be people who buy it. What hasn't helped is the problems which have delayed the launch and from my understanding are still not totally fixed.,2019-09-30

Their current promotion where you get a $200 credit for accessories says it will last until Oct 11. Is it likely they'll bring back the higher trade-in deal after that? The Note 9 is my first Samsung phone so I don't know how they did their promotions in previous years.",2019-09-30

The fact is, if it isn't an iPhone, you are down to 75% (if you are lucky) as a starting point. It is also a 5G phone and most people will either view that as an extravagance they don't need or know it is useless where they live.

Samsung would never release a product that would consistently not work properly, and in the UNPACKED event, it was explicitly told that call quality with the inner mic would make the other person in the call easily heard.

They designed the Apple TV to work with Apple devices, mainly because they designed it Samsung is just recently moving into the whole one smart home ecosystem thing with their Smart Things. Basically they used to be like Sony, but only now are moving into emulating what Apple did but isn't there yet, but they can't just link everything together just like that at the snap of a finger. The Airpods and Sennheisers likely use industry standard protocols, but from what I could tell from the Galaxy Buds they're designed to work with the Galaxy phones and that's it.

The other example I gave, Sony, has their camera department refusing to work with their smartphone department. It took a new CEO to force them to do it. At the top, Samsung does not work like Apple because they make everything from carbon nanotubes to friggin tanks for the Korean military. Samsung's mobile division has to talk to the TV division first. It really can't be compared because these are two different approaches.",2019-10-01

127,"Privacy issues aside, the good thing about Google apps is that they are brand agnostic. You aren't stuck using Samsung if you ever decide to leave. The bad thing is that there are a lot of weird feature ommissions. Samsung apps are feature rich, sync to Google, Microsoft and Firefox, and are very well integrated. Personally I use mostly Samsung apps. The Samsung browser, for example, is way better than Chrome. It uses Chromium engine, has a better night mode (no sudden bright white loading/splash screens), anti tracking/ad blocking extensions, and can sync bookmarks to any Chromium based browser or Firefox on a desktop/laptop. It can also be used as the device assistant with a customizable search engine of choice. Google Photos is great in it has unlimited photo backup. I don't use it personally because I realize I'll just end up with a metric ton of photos there. I keep them just backed up on Samsung cloud so I can better manage them from growing too many and delete from time to time. Samsung cloud only keeps a copy of the ones on the phone though, so if you delete it from the phone it's gone forever. I manually separate photos I want to keep into my PC.",2019-10-02

I don't speak Chinese of course (I live and am in Italy) and I don't know if they do, but they told me that this writing means ""unauthorized repair"" so basically they think I had already broken my phone before and I got it repaired by someone else.

Coming from Sony phones I am used to and prefer it. There's a lot of optimisation that needs to be done on your end to be able to get 5-6 hrs SOT. The most I've had is 6. The worst part of this phone is the Standby time kills battery. I have everything off - AOD, Sync (I just sync my Gmail myself), location (rip rewards), low brightness with a max of 40% which is plenty bright anyway and 20-0% at night, a lot of the gestures like lift to wake etc, Samsung edge turned off, whatever I can turn off that isn't useful or I need really. Can't think of anything more ATM. I always keep my phone topped up during the day anyway as I'm usually always near a charger. Other than the battery optimisation, the phone is near perfect.

If you want to wear white obvious headphones everywhere that make you look like you don't want to talk to anyone in public, airpods may be more your speed. Also, airpods don't encapsulate sound very much, they're pretty loose in the ear, so wearing them everywhere is possible because someone can talk to you and you can hear them. Samsung buds on the other hand encapsulate very well. The rubber nub on the earbud keeps the sound in very well, and makes it hard for your experience to be disturbed by ambient noise, and even loud noise. For this reason, there is a setting that lets the bud mix in ambient sound while you're using them (through the existing mic on the bud) which makes it LESS encapsulated, but only when you choose. They're also quite inconspicuous when in your ear. The Bose soundsport were great but VERY conspicuous, like a Borg Headset ... and the airpods, well ... yeah.",2019-10-02

Also the s11 is rumored to use a 90hz panel, if true then that will compensate and make it comparable to iOS' fluidity) •Cameras are great but from what I've seen(through friends phones compared to mine) skin tones/human subjects definitely look better on the newer iPhones (s11 is gonna focus on cameras next year so we'll have to see what Samsung delivers with the new tech) •If you're locked into the apple ecosystem then it's gonna be quite difficult to switch Welp that's all I got.

172,"It depends. If you're a casual phone user that uses their phone for basic stuff like social media, youtube, netflix, reddit, internet browsing, and other basic stuff you should stick to iPhone.

There is more to assessing space then going ""oh, I opened the phone and it looks like there is space."" 3) Based upon industry trends, a reasonable opinion would be there isn't a snowball's chance in Phoenix of there being a headphone jack in the S11. It isn't just the phone design (which is still speculative) that needs to be considered. They spun their marketing to discount the headphone jack and you can expect a united front on the flagships going forward. Given robust Note sales, which are better than the past couple models, there is no reason to expect back tracking. 4) Whether it is a Samsung flagship or an iPhone, they are all precisely engineered devices. Armchair engineers can blather on to their heart's content but that doesn't make everything marketing BS just because they say so.",2019-10-03

208,"The Battery of Note 10: The talk-time of Note 10 dissected for you! Samsung Note 10 is the latest Samsung product that came into the market last year. The product was hailed as groundbreaking by the Samsung company because of its stronger RAM, processing power and the ability to give the user a strong experience. But now, the product has to be vetted for one major factor, and that is, the battery of Samsung Note 10. The Samsung Note 10 has a battery life of 9 to 10 hours a day and is considered some of the highest battery times the brand has provided in recent history. Now, here we come with the breakdown of various other time frames that are significant in assessing the quality of the product. **LTE 2.0Gbps:** Samsung launched the Exynos 9 Series 9820 Processor that takes the 2.0 Gbps LTE Advanced Pro Modem that the company is taking great pride in. The product has the neural processing unit (NPU) which is a greatly advanced processing system. Android works with the artificially intelligent system that focuses on the intelligent learning of the patterns that the person follows and developing an android’s behavioral pattern that will cater to the user’s pattern of thinking. This will make sure that the device runs smoothly and will also troubleshoot issues that occur due to over usage of the same few features over and over again. **PROCESSOR 7nm:** NM in this context is nanometer, the thickness of the transistors used in the androids is of 7nm and the product will have the 7nm of transistor capacity. This will make the CPU considerably powerful and will make the product easier to use. The processing power means that even though the product has multiple heavy-handed features, the processor can handle the burden and will make the product quickly. The Note10 has been in the market for a year now and the product does not hang that often. **RAM 12GB:** The RAM in [Note 10 plus]( is 12 GB and this is the main reason that the device has such power. Usually, the products cannot even offer a 10GB RAM of processing speed by the Processor with 7nm of transistor potential combined with the 12 GB of RAM will give you a device that will run like a horse. No matter how heavy your products are, you will have a successful device that does not hang up usually. **Internal Storage:** The device has an internal storage of 512 GB that is a stronger internal storage capacity than most of the laptops and computers that are available in the market. The reason is that the internal storage in this device is designed to allow the user to download heavy tv shows and similar content so that they can enjoy the content on the Hi-definition android. These are the main reasons you should have Note 10 on your next shopping list. This is a great product for you and your family. Share your thoughts in the comments section.",2019-10-03

The A series were their testbed for implementing new features before being ported to the flagship ones. But ever since competition in the midrange got stiffer, other phones in the range especially ones from the Chinese market, were offering dual or triple camera, big memory and powerful graphics, all while in a plastic body without any IP rating and people were picking them up, thus Samsung realizing that maybe these were not necessary on the mid range lineup. That's why they refreshed the midrange lineup and offered the A*xx* series as the upper midrange while the M*xx* series were the lower/budget lineup. Also, I guess it is hard to implement water resistance when using plastic. I mean, the S5 had it before but it was not fully sealed still since the plastics flex too much.",2019-10-04

On an iPhone, things tend to be managed a certain way by iOS but Android gives you a lot more customisation and choice... Because of this, you should check certain things that you might want more control over, for example, what apps are running heavy in the background and killing your standby time? You should be able to manage permissions and turn off any unnecessary processes to save up some battery life. If you go really hard into cutting off features (some people don't want to) you can make a phone last a lot longer on a single charge. Make sure and check that no apps have sneakily ended up in the Device Maintenance &gt; Battery &gt; Unmonitored Apps section, because I've know some heavy apps to end up here (not sure how or why) and they're then allowed to eat away at your battery without any warning",2019-10-04

They've had this for several generations now, AFTER a ""beta test"" with the S6 and S7. To go backwards on their design principles would be a bad look. 4. Pretty sure 45W is the fastest in any phone right now. And the 25W (I think?) Included in the box is already insanely fast. Not sure what else you're expecting here. 5. Also gone for good.

319,"Ok 2 things. 1)There is link to windows 2) Samsung dex 1) Link to windows: allows all my notifications to come to my phone and i can mirror my phone. Reply to text as well. This is done by downloading the my companion app on Microsoft store. The app is already preinstalled in the note10 as part of the partnership with Microsoft. Goal: to create similar experience for android users just like iphone and macbook. 2) Samsung Dex: more of a semi-virtual computer. More so as using your phone as a makeshift computer. Tip: from my experience(owner of the Samsung notebook9 pro 2019), dex is better using a monitor than a laptop. For those curious, i use the Samsung $89.99 multiport adapter. Goal: pc portable computing. Similarities of Dex and Link to Windows: - both can see notifications - both can receive files -both can send/reply messages Apps that are not officially supported will not be fully optimized, but may work. Fun fact, as of 2weeks ago when i used dex(windows), Netflix would not work, but when used only with a monitor, Netflix worked.",2019-10-05
320,"I would argue they're more powerful, not from raw specs but in flexibilityof the operating system and the plethora of features. As far as biometrics go, Samsung does need to improve facial recognition; they do have a secure fingerprint scanner though, unlike Apple's newest, which is a nice advantage for me unless Apple's facial recognition works in the dark without having to bump up the screen's brightness at all. iCloud sounds just as good as OneDrive, which can seamlessly connect Samsung's products and, unless I'm mistaken, you only get ⅓ of the free storage Samsung gives. Funny enough, I saw a side-by-side picture comparison of the Note10 and iPhone 11 Pro on Twitter the other day the one I liked more and thought might be the iPhone(because of how much praise Apple gets about their camera) was actually the Note10. Price-wise, Apple's not very different from Apple on the high end, in some cases being more expensive.

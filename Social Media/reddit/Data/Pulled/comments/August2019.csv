38,"IMO the outcry wasn't really as big with the IR blaster. Plus Samsung had an ulterior motive with that because they're pushing Smart Things, one remote to control everything and it won't rely on IR.
Same as with removable battery. Instead of manufacturers trying to attract Samsung customers with removable batteries, the majority of them went with Samsung in sealed units.
In the case of microSD, many manufacturers kept it and the memory of the S6 and Note 5 simply weren't enough for it to go just yet.
The return of the headphone jack now rests on 2 things. 1 is the Pixel. The Pixel 3a brought back the jack in their lineup. If the P4 gets it, then we have a viable competitor to Samsung that has it. 2 is the sales of the Note 10. If it's low and the major reason is the jack.

Wowza, Android is customizable. Did all that copy and pasting for nothing because no one said it wasn’t? And yeah, iOS is better than OneUI. It’s a lot less bloated than OneUI, a lot smoother and a lot faster. Sure you have widgets and stuff, but usually people install launchers over Samsung’s OneUI because of how clunky it is anyway.  I agree in the fact that in a lot of ways Android is better than iOS, but the software is a lot cleaner and faster on iPhones. 

You can customize sound on iPhone, though I’ll admit there is no Dolby Atmos.

People who use the “Samsung makes their screen,” argument have no idea what they’re talking about. Samsung isn’t just letting them barrow their technology, that’s not how it works. Samsung is a manufacturer for chips, screens and more. They literally manufacture Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors but that doesn’t mean they helped make them. Samsung makes screens to Apple’s specifications. *Apple* **engineered** the screens, and *Samsung* **makes** them. Just as Ricky Smith down at the factor didn’t design the Tesla Roadster, he just built it.

Bixby sucks just as much as Siri. Objectively, Google Assistant is the way to go on Android. Apple never claims innovation or claims to make certain things first.

Over the course of several days and nights I found the same issue and the buds just didnt seem to charge wirelessly though they charged using the wire. At one point the led lights both inside and outside the case just stopped working. I took them to the service centre at least 4 times and everytime they told me they found no issue with it. At one point I managed to make the case yellow but when I placed it back on the charger and checked on it again after awhile it was red again. Am I doing something wrong, or is there a reason why the techs say it works fine but I cant get it to work. They told me not to charge it overnight in case overcharging is the issue, but even then I couldnt get it to charge. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks",2019-08-02 18:00:56

I`d call up BB and see whats up, Samsung after confirmation from BB with paperwork.

228,Apple watch is the best smartwatch. I believe Samsung are second best. I dropped my iPhone X and AW S3 for my S10 and it's still worth it imo even without a watch. I honestly didn't need it as much as I thought I did since I dont do cardio.,2019-08-03 18:51:20

As much as some people don’t want to believe it, wireless is the future. Wires only complicate things. Because of this, I hope Samsung bundles the Buds with the Note 10.",2019-08-03 19:38:17

234,"And it is feature packed, if you consider th fact that the Note 10+ is the real flagship here.
-

-TOF camera
-3 Stage Variable Aperture
-IPX9 water resistance rating
-Upgraded SPen, air gesture support.
-Upgraded Dex, wireless
-256 GBS base storage
-12 GBS of Ram base on Note 10+
-4300 mAh battery.
-UFS 3.0 Storage
-45w Fast charging support 
-6.8 Inch Display

And I’m sure there’s much more that’s coming that’ll be revealed at the event.

The removal of the jack isn’t so bad when you consider everything you’re getting with the phone, especially at $1,100. You’ll get a dongle in the box if you’re that desperate to use your wired earbuds you bought at Dollar Tree. The Buds might come bundled in with the phone just as Samsung did with the S10.",2019-08-03 22:37:25

237,"Is the 6th gen the newest one or?n(I'm not into apple but their new tablets seem pretty.. fire haha

Now I'm fully into samsung products so I got this but I really like it..

Anyways for your question.. So far pretty sure no lags and I'm hitting it somewhat hard.. Like I multitask a lot (pdf and notes split screen along with calculator, internet and sometimes youtube in popup window) all without issues..

I also draw in autodesk sketchbook which is pretty smooth on even big canvases like 3000x4500..

Battery is also quite impressive.. I get anywhere from 9h sot (if I crank up the brightness to 70% (which is a lot with this thing..) to like 12h in span of day or even 3..

Now If I was you I would wait for a bit and get tab s6.. (It has even faster cpu 2gb more ram, 128gb base instead of 64gb, thinner bezels so overall a bit smaller with same display.. Spot on th3 back for s pen which now has bluetooth features.. And keyboard case is way better now if you decide to get one.. 

Now if you would tell me what are you planning to do I might give you better suggestion of what to get 😁",2019-08-04 00:28:45

241,"Ok now we're talking..

I can tell that we are on the same page tho.. I always said that having small top bezel that will house everything is nest solution till they hide the camera under the display.. 

That's why I hated s10+ (especially.. since s10 is kinda fine but still dumb solution) Anyways s10+ hole is really big and it forces notf bar to be wide so you effectively lose all the space you got and while watching yt or something that space around camera means nothing really .. That design is cool for the first 2min and after that you're like ok but this is so pointless and dumb.. Bezel is much better solution ... 

I have n8 too and I love it.. if the chin and side bezels were smaller as well as slightly minimizing the top bezel that would be the perfect design in my eyes 👌🏽

And yeah lately upgrades are so small that I don't even buy every new phone (even tho I was crazy for em and was switching every year.. But tbh just 3y ago samsung phones wheren't even close to what they are now.. Like I had note edge and my friend had note 4 that phone got so laggy and battery got fucked after like one year of use and now I use almost 2y old n8 that still works flawlessly with very little lag and battery that is still quite impressive (4h sot and whole day of use which for 3300mah very used bat is pretty good) 

Now the note 10+ is gonna be huge upgrade from n8 bc it honestly does look much sexier (like sure that hole is not the best solution but I have to admit that I kinda like it and I don't think it'll be that distracting) and has bigger battery (which is for me the biggest thing) has under display fp scanner (also very big for me) and than other stuff like more ram more base storage better chip (which yeah I agree most people don't even need but I do some ps or drawing so I hope I'll notice some improvement) and also better cameras (the wide angle lens in particular)..

Now the next year will probably be similar with some improvements but not as drastic as few years ago so I'll probably skip it too and wait for n12",2019-08-04 01:22:09

246,"Well, it was a cumulation of price reductions, and in the end it actually costed less than an A40 :))
First of all, it was bought from a carrier (orange in Romania) fully unlocked because carriers here don't touch phones anymore, and because my mom extended her subscription (which she would have anyway), it got reduced to 480€ 
Then, we had a buy back voucher worth 160€ (I gave...a Galaxy Xcover 3, because another promotion said that if it was a Samsung Galaxy traded and you bought a phone from the S10 series you got an additional 150€)
Then, on the online store of said carrier, for every degree outside higher than 20°C you had a price cut of 1% at every product, but at 30°C you had 15% instead of the normal 10%

Overall as my first fitness tracker it's petty good. In terms of battery life, if your using the watch significantly to track exercises, sleep and stream notifications then you get about 5 days of battery rather than the advertised 7. The heart rate tracking has no trouble reading my heart rate. The sleep tracking works well too. The display is really good on the Fit, colours are vibrant and the Amoled is nice. I found that the stress tracking is really just your heart rate when your it's now tracking an activity, i.e., doing press ups and then measuring your stress will read you as stressed. There are lots of widgets on the watch which show the weather, your calendar and let your add cups of water or caffeine. One disappointment is that you can't control your music natively and it requires buying an app, and if an app can let your Fit control music then I'm sure Samsung can implement a software update to add this. I have already received 3 software updates for my Fit though so Samsung are keen to adding and polishing features.

iPhone will release updates but remember they got caught by slowing the CPU for better battery life.  4 years iPhone lasted no longer than 2 years because of this issue.

I was thinking about the iPad because it's really cheap. Like $250 and I gotta buy a pen with it. 

As for the Samsung. They have a deal on their site, the keyboard, and the 64gb wifi tablet model for $500.

I just heard that the Samsung one was rivaling the pro so I was thinking maybe spending an extra hundred or two and getting the better one. 

I'm just sceptical of the Samsung one because I had the note 10.1. And that thing used to lag just trying to unlock the device. I initially had battery problems as well.",2019-08-04 06:55:26
272,"Oh ok..

Well for school purposes you gonna love this one.. I use it for the same thing basically (split screen of a book and notes or tasks and notes along with popup calculator and browser.. chat or whatever I need and it all works very fluidly) 

The keyboard deal is nice bc it's a good way to cary it like that and it's obviously nice to have keyboard for like essays or taking notes in class if you're allowed to do that (bc I think I'm not 🙄) 

What pro version? When? If it's based on android it's not worth the money I'll say that right away since android is limited in pro apps category that anything more powerful than mobil chips is pointless.. Like the good photoshop is struggle to find, in fact I use lightroom and adobe sketchbook to edit photos and sometimes I even need to take like android adobe photoshop to add extra blur or something... Also you can't edit videos or run visual studio to develop apps (which are all things that I would like to do on go but with android it's either limited or not possible..

Anyways for school and entertainment I would strongly recommend it.. Multitasking is very fluid and writing with pen is easy and comfortable (I can basically write as good and small as on paper even if I only use 2/3 of a display for the notes.. 
Also display is good size and high resolution and quality as well as brightness.. And finally battery life is also pretty good with at least 9+h of SOT no matter what.. 

Also I'm gonna recomend you a few apps to boost the multitasking experience...
1. You wanna hide the navigation bar and switch it up for gestures *this will give you full screen multitasking ability instead of part of the screen being taken by unnecessary bar

2. You wanna get multi star - which will bring back some multitasking stuff from previous system

3. Finally you wanna get task changer which will allow you to hold onto an app from recents and just drag it to left/right to multitask orr drag to centre of the screen to pop it up (and from recent you even like all apps icon and from there you can hold any app from your tablet and drag it into split screen or popup..

If you still have issues after this, type *#0*# into your phone keypad and tap sensor, then at the bottom do a normal scan. Let it run and see if they all pass. If any fail take to a Samsung service centre.

If I hadn't had a whole month feeling uneasy about being stuck paying for two phones, my biggest complaint would've been the fact that I had to wait exactly a full year to order the S10...thus missing all the preorder promos.

No matter if you love Samsung or Apple, in the end they're both companies that want to make money and they'll both continue to do what they want. Samsung does a good job of listening to their customers compared to Apple..(apple just waits for Samsung to piss off their customers ie the note 7 and s6 controversy..forcing conversions by default) but ultimately, they'll do what they want and what makes them money.

It's on the note 10+, which is the phone you should be getting anyway as a ""Power"" user which is who the note series are for. And tbh, if the starting space is 256GB, most people won't need an SD card seeing as 90% of the things can be streamed online. We are not living in the day and age of 16GB phones anymore, so stop acting like it's a required thing in a phone when you stream your music through spotify or w/e app you use, you watch youtube, you stream netflix, etc etc. Most people just don't need an SD card.

365,"Hello!

I have a Samsung S10 Plus on Verizon. I upgraded from the Google Pixel earlier this year, and after doing an exhausting amount of research I decided to give Samsung a shot. 

I will admit I wasn't really a fan of Samsung devices, I used to work for AT&amp;T and while I was there we had a few issuees with some of the deivces we were carrying at that time. But, the S10 got great reviews, I had some tech savvy friends who all suggested I give it a whirl, so I bit the bullet.

So I have some issues, I dont know if its me, or if Im just being picky cuz I wasnt totally sold on it. (by the end of this you will also learn, I was COMPLETELY sold on my pixel, didnt go to the 3 cuz it was getting panned by all my go to tech sites...)

Issues:

MY SWYPE SUCKS!!!  Even the most basic words come out like total garbage, and on occasion my predictive text will ""predict"" that i have had a stroke, and words like ""predict"" will come out damn near different each time. I just swyped the word predict and I got precidentt, precent, percocet and president. I'll also add that the swype on my older tablet works fine. 

my voice chat  also sucks most of the time and puts out sentences that make absolutely no sense and sound NOTHING like what was said. I have no heavy or thick accent, slight new yorker, so its not like im confusing the system.

Forget about OK Google. I have to literally YELL at my phone for that to work, meanwhile my tablet, which is a 3 year old black friday deal model, picks up when i say OK Google from across the room. 

Has anyone else come across any of these Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus tech woes,  or is skynet simply out to get me?",2019-08-05 14:21:32
366,"Hi. I'm a new owner of the Samsung J3. It's a decent phone and I don't need a phone to do much, so it's fine for me. Well, it was.

After my phone updated to Android Pie my app notifications are either inconsistent or nonexistent. Before Pie, everything was cool. Now if I get a message thru Kik, I don't get a notification. I have to actually start the app and then magically the notification pops up. This also happens with other apps such as a game that came pre-installed. I have to open the app for most notifications to come through. And yet oddly ,some do. Some of the game notifications work, some don't. 

And yet Gmail and most of my text messages send notifications immediately. I have tried EVERYTHING. I've fiddled with phone notification settings, I've looked into the apps' own settings. I've even disabled Do Not Disturb. Nothing I have changed has made one iota of difference.

Had anyone else seen this with Android Pie? I've seen ppl complaining on a few other sites but I've yet to see anything that makes a difference.",2019-08-05 14:35:16

It's just easier to hold, which is great for me because I'm clumsy and can accidentally drop my phone from time to time if it's too big. It's finger scanner is lightning fast and you'll know where it is every time, which helps with Samsung pass/pay. The 256GB actually has 8GB ram so it keeps up with the s10 and s10+. I personally haven't had the battery die on me yet and I play Pokemon Go and Wizards United daily, major battery drainers. The camera is all I need it to be and more. The screen is beautiful and I couldn't notice a difference between the 3 side by side in best buy.

A70 doesn't have wireless charging or an IP rating, but has a bigger battery and an on-screen fingerprint sensor. It has a mid-tier processor and has 3 cameras, not sure about their exact quality. the A70 is larger than the s10. 

I got my s10e the month of launch and I don't regret it. The size difference isnt that big compared to my s8 and the jump to the s10 wasn't worth it imo. I personally like feeling boujee so I like having flagship phones especially because I want it running well 2 yrs from now when I upgrade again, but the A70 is still a good phone.

So it's actually cheaper to upgrade yearly with a pre-order than every 2 years. Even waiting for Black Friday might get me $300 off but how much could I get a trade in for and no free promo gear? Also I don't have the ""I bought this phone on sale 6 months ago, now something new and shiny makes it look like trash and now I have to wait for it"".

If your screen does break on Android it's much easier to fix as you have more options. Most of the 'ghetto screen repair shops' may look suspicious but it gets the job done. Brands like Samsung do offer repair services similar to apple and they even offer doorstep repairs. Apples phone are wayyy harder to repair as they don't want anyone messing with the insides with their phones which is why the most common way to repair an iPhone is to go directly to the apple store.

452,"&gt;Galaxy buds have a 2 hour longer battery life than airpods

Yeah that's true. But as a counter point I'd say the case has more recharges available. The air pods case offers an extra 24 hours. I think the galaxy buds only offer an extra 10(I could be wrong. I just remember its a lot less then air pods). 

I wasn't saying they don't have flaws. I agree almost completely with you on most of that. The only points I disagree on are the fit. At least in my personal experience air pods actually fit pretty nice and never fell out. 

I have both for a reason. I already had airpods from when I used my iPhone. I only got galaxy buds after I got my S10. I love the galaxy buds for music. But my weekly calls that I have to be on for work they're awful. Even after updates. And I've also have more random cut outs of sound on here then I ever have on airpods. If Samsung could address the call quality issues and the Bluetooth cut out issues I'd probably stop using my airpods completely.",2019-08-06 16:58:47

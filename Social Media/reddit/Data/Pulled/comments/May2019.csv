19,"**TL:DR at bottom**

Hello all, I have a strange one:

Not too long ago I had a Samsung JV 3 phone, which served me well, but I broke it. So the phone was replaced with an exact model. Well...

...On the previous phone I could rotate the home screen from portrait to landscape, and the phone would flip display modes. So I tried to re-instate that feature on this replacement, only to not be able to rotate the home screen.

Yes, apps rotate when flipped to landscape. Yes, I called Verizon technical support, and Verizon even got in contact with Samsung, only to have Verizon tell me that feature was never available for that model phone. The help technician double-checked with me regarding the capability of changing display modes for home screens, app screens, and I confirmed I could do it with the previous phone. She seemed confused. So was I, as I clearly remember being able to flip the phone to landscape in home screen mode.

Did I miss something? Is there a feature or setting I'm completely overlooking? Any assistance would be appreciated.

**TLDR**: I used to be able to change the orientation of my home screens to either landscape or portrait, now I cannot. I would like to be able to rotate phone home screens to both display modes.",2019-04-30 13:03:26

&amp;#x200B;

I submitted the ticket on April 9th, 2019.

After 9 emails and 7 calls (total of an hour and a half on the phone), I finally got an email today (not too long after another 21 minute) telling me that my refund was on the way. Overall I'm still out a bit of money - about $24 from keeping my protection plan on the old phone for two whole months just in case, and another $30 because a phone payment went through and the upgrade program only covers what was still owed on the previous device =/

&amp;#x200B;

I am super done dealing with it so I guess Samsung can keep that money. I will probably do the upgrade program again, but next time I'm not picking the fancy version of the phone - that way I can trade it in to someone more reliable for the next go around (I'm sure the ceramic s10 won't have extra trade in value.) I guess I could also sell it used, but doing phone sales myself, I've seen too many used phone sales go bad to risk it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for hangin' in with me there. If you ever trade in a device to Samsung yourself, make sure you take lots of pictures - maybe even video of yourself putting the device in the box. Or, as I recommend, trade it in to someone else.

92,"I'm thinking of buying my mom a phone. How is Samsung A70? Only things that bother me are that how is the water/dust proof and are the speakers how bad? Good comparison could be S7 edge since that is the latest phone I remember listening with no stereo speakers. She is coming from Samsung J5 (2015 version)

&amp;#x200B;

I want to get her a phone that has headphone jack, big screen and good cameras with ultrawide lens.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean Huawei P30 or LG G8 ThinQ are great candidates at the same price range but

P30 doesnt have the 5-50x optical zoom

LG G8 ThinQ video audio or whatever its called IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. I don't know why people say it's good? Or do I just have bad ears?

&amp;#x200B;

Also EMUI seems bad and LG UX probably not that great either

One UI is really good and I think it's honestly on par/better than stock android",2019-05-02 03:53:39

94,You can't be serious. I don't think there's a regular smart phone that could handle being thrown around. You should look into getting an active range phone.

Samsung does not have much of a retail presence of its own, but has partnerships with several companies for customer support after sale.

They do in and out of warranty work, you can set appointments via their website, and they use OEM parts. You can also use the Samsung Members app to web chat with a tech if needs be.

I had my phone system language set to English as the main language, with swiss-French being second in the list. and discovered that the French keyboard was in AZERTY instead of QWERTZ only workaround I found is to switch my phone system language to Swiss-French instead of English, then the French keyboard would have the correct QWERTZ layout. 
Is there any way that I can get my phone in swiss-french QWERTZ while having my system language to english , with the default Samsung keyboard? I'm trying to avoid a third party keyboard since I like the Samsung one.

186,"(I'm sorry this is so long. Two questions with bullet points if you want to skim.)

&amp;#x200B;

Recently had to upgrade the wifi at my place and now we have 2.4 and 5G. They told me to use 5G for all of my streaming. I've been using an older smart TV with limited capabilities so I just use a Chromecast for all of my streaming. Got it set up, used it for a few days with no issues whatsoever, but my TV suddenly died. It was a Vizio something or other that I traded an ex for when he moved out. 

• Anyway, now I need a new TV and I would like a nice smart TV with apps built in so I don't have to juggle apps on my phone and Chromecast all the time. BUT, I've noticed some popular smart TVs aren't 5G compatible (nearly bought a Samsung but noticed the complaints online). How do I know if a TV is 5G compatible? It doesn't say in the specs on Best Buy or Walmart's websites. Googling just brings up complaints from people trying to connect who are realizing the TV they just bought isn't compatible. 

• My second question is if I got one of these Samsung TVs that isn't compatible with 5G, can I just use a Chromecast and have the Chromecast and my phone connected to the 5G and not my TV? I'm assuming that my old smart TV wasn't 5G compatible but I never connected the TV to the internet, just the Chromecast. But could that be what killed it? I'm thinking my internet provider should have warned us about this, but I barely know anything about this lol.... 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",2019-05-03 07:21:17

These are not small problems... And you're not some special human who gets to notice these issues while ""99% of people will go about their days without even noticing them.""

Random screen flickers at times and random vibrations? Those are major issues and something 100% of people will notice. As for unnecessary lags... I can't say much about that since ""lag"" in general is very subjective. 

&gt;You must think I have a lot of time on my hands. For all I know, the problems might have even disappeared because I reset it when i sold it

Hmm. So, because you don't have time on your hand, you couldn't even reset the phone to check if it would fix the problems. You instead took pictures and put up your Note 9 for sale on some website, went out to buy a new phone, and either shipped the Note 9 to the buyer or met the buyer in person in a public location to do a cash transaction, all while still having to reset the phone for the sale? And the phone you decided to get is another Android while you're here boasting about the great OS iPhones have?

Anyways, let me help you understand something. Whatever happened to your Note 9 is called a defect. Defects happen, which is why Samsung has manufacturer's warranty. No matter how much you prefer the iPhone's OS, they are also prone to defects, which is why Apple has manufacturer's warranty. 

If I get an iPhone with unusual problems that 99.99999% of the iPhone users don't experience but use these problems to say a statement like ""This is why iPhone's OS is inferior to Android,"" I would probably become the laughingstock.

243,"not OP but I switched from an iPhone 6S to an S10e. Price point was the same as the iPhone 8 which was the next affordable step for me in the iOS ecosystem, and seeing as I have a MacBook Pro and iPad mini, I thought it was the obvious choice. 

&amp;#x200B;

But having said that, the iPhone 8 really isn't any different from the 6S, you lose the headphone jack and I was bored of having the same phone. I also didn't really use the continuity features between all 3 devices all that much. I didn't want to go to an X model as I'm not comfortable with facial recognition biometrics and the X models lose Touch ID altogether. I would essentially be getting the same phone minus some features I enjoyed if I'd stayed with Apple (even if I could afford an X model). 

&amp;#x200B;

Or I could get the Samsung, which was the same price as the 8, but a brand new smartphone with way more features and customisability and kept the features I would lose by staying with Apple. The transfer of data went smoothly and the only things I've really lost are a couple of paid apps and game data as well as internet bookmarks. but contacts, pictures, notes even, have all ported across fine. its going to take a while to get used to as there are SO MANY more settings and options with Android, but I definitely don't think that's a bad thing. Also, camera is night and day with iPhone - so much better.",2019-05-04 02:56:41

278,"Four features ios has that Android doesn't: Facetime, iMessage, live Camera, and a working face id. After I switched to Samsung there was nothing at all that I missed. With Android pie and Samsung One, Android has a much more premium feel to it. I have to admit I was not a big fan of Lolipop. Transfering data from your phone will be easy as Samsungs ship with a wire that you just connect and it all transfers within an hour. You can also transfer things to or from your Android just by dragging them from your PC. That is literally the biggest thing that made me switch and I love it. Samsungs also have multi tasking, so you can have two apps on your screen at a time. You can watch Youtube in the background and it even works with some music video.(Not with all) You don't need all of your apps on the home screen. a lot nicer than Siri, even if it's ui isn't as nice imo. You can also put widgets on the home screen, (I sort of miss the ios widget page) or make blank home screens to enjoy your wallpaper. File management is a dream, just make new folders and drag files around with your PC. You have a standard USB-C charger that lasts longer. The phones are all much better value. (AAt least with the S Series, idk about Note) The 128 gb Samsung is 50 dollars cheaper than the iPhone XR and has a better screen, the 512GB S10 is 200 dollars cheaper than the 256GB XS, and the 512gb S10+ is 300 dollars cheaper than the XS Max.

&amp;#x200B;

There are some downsides to Samsung and Android. From what I hear Samsung is terribly slow with updates. The RAM management is shit. My phone has 6gbs and just sitting at the home screen takes up half of it. When you have several apps open in the background it really really really shows.  That's all I have really noticed.

I am on my second Samsung TV.  First was was high end for its day $2k+... failed in 5 years, something about the power supply.  My current TV is 4.5 years old, gets used &lt;4 hrs a day.  Screen flashed the other night and now the top has lines and is slow to refresh.  I went through the diagnostics and its some kind of board failure.  

My question is why buy Samsung?  I can buy a POS Walmart off brand the dies every 4-5 years.  I buy name brand to avoid these issues.  They referred me to a local TV tech, no idea what that will cost.  Prob cheaper to buy another, wont be a Samsung.

The switch was painless and soon had my apps all set up and I was back to having a phone setup as I wanted in a few days. 

Now the question of the ecosystem, it’s the one that usually pulls you back unless you are set in your mind you want to change and not just want to play with a new shiney toy. The usual problem is moving to an android phone and then wanting to be set up and work as an iPhone, you want it to integrate with all your other apple products and in essence want nothing to change. If that’s your approach, save your money and stay with Apple.

If however you are going to embrace the Chang, be willing to change daily workflows and usage. Make the new device work for you rather than trying to making it work like an Apple product ... then you will make the switch and soon discover a device more than capable of doing all you thought you needed and much more.

I am really enjoying the S10+ and can honestly say I haven’t regretted the move. The camera is excellent, but word of advice don’t keep comparing to iPhone pictures as they both process images in a different way so you will be continually finding differences. Learn to use the new camera and enjoy using it to capture great images. Don’t forget the old saying “the best camera is the one you have with you”

438,"1. Samsung has it's own in built remapping service.  I have the Bixby button set to open up my bus and train times. It works flawlessly.

2. Bixby is completely unobtrusive across my device. I don't use it at all and its never once been opened accidentally, it doesn't push notifications to me, I don't have the panel to the left of the home screen turned on.

3. Bixby isn't designed to replace anything. Google voice assistant has it's own hardware button on the phones, holding in the pressure sensitive home  button engages it. What it's designed to do is operate within the bounds of the Samsung ecosystem, using Samsung's well established smart devices, such as refrigerators, dishwashers, washing machines, TVs, stereos, etc.

4. The app suite isn't a copy of anything. Its an alternative to Google services. Personally,  I don't use many of them, however I do use the calendar, notes, email, and internet. I do this for the simple reason of, I can set up adblockers, I avoid using Google services as much as possible to preserve my online privacy. 

5. The use case for the sort of things you're describing is very narrow and specific. People will buy a case with an air quality sensor due to, as a simplification, 2 reasons: they have a reason to doubt their air quality and it's a cheap/convenient method of doing so. 

This is great, and it's a clever implementation of tech. A purpose built sensor with purpose built software is going to be cheaper to develop than as a feature on an already expensive device. Samsung's flagships use the best screens, processors, and other parts available. This eats into development budget. 

6. With several billion dollars behind you, you could make a feature-rich phone that I have no doubt would be a great device to use, if you had any intelligence. However,  could you market it, produce it and make a profit on it while listening to investors and directors and management? I doubt it. 

Risk-taking in technology has become less mainstream due to the dropping in profits over the last year or so in the smartphone market, particularly in the premium ranges. This isn't Samsung specific. 

7. Yep, note phones are the best in the world for productivity, nothing like them, nothing as well implemented as them. 

8. You can uninstall it. You can wipe your entire device and install a custom ROM. Nobody is stopping you.

444,"Hello everyone, Note 9 user here having extremely frustrating Bluetooth issues, specifically audio quality.

I've tried around 6 different Bluetooth earbud sets, ranging from cheap Amazon brands to beatsx.

Everything seems to connect and use a shitty codec, usually SBC but one or two use AAC and still have garbled sound. doesn't seem to matter what the advertised codec or Bluetooth revision is.

This is backed up by the fact that I can't change the codec in the developer options, and by the fact that when I pair these same devices to my old iPhone 5s, the sound quality is fine, no garbling, no disconnects, volume is fine etc. this goes for all tested devices except one of the cheap Amazon brands which sounded bad on both devices, and the beatsx which sound good on both but are a much older model and don't work in other ways. (disconnects, resetting pairing, doesn't hold a charge etc.)

I use Bluetooth earbuds every day at work and frequently in my non work life, and I've had this note 9 for about 6 months now and I'm starting to question if I should keep it.

I ordered some new Galaxy buds that will be here sometime this week, if those work and sound good and I'm happy then I may stick with them and the note. 

just curious if anyone has any insight on this because it severely limits the value of this expensive phone for me. curious if it's a Samsung thing, a note 9 thing, an android thing, or what. because I have considered a pixel phone and I even entertain switching back to whatever iPhone they come out with this year.

465,I don't have the option for Samsung Cloud to sync gallery photos. I had this option on my note 9. Now I have a Verizon S10. The option is no longer in the gallery app. I found the settings to the Samsung Cloud app itself. Here you can see it lets me sync almost everything but no photos.  I know about Google photos and I already use it but I wanted to use Samsung cloud for other reasons.,2019-05-08 17:45:54
466,"I bought these earbuds only spending about 30 bucks because I returned my Icon X 2018(they were not working correctly, searched it up and A LOT of people were having the same problem) and honestly these are the best pair of earbuds I have ever had. I wouldn't say top 5 by any means, but for the price, especially if you can get it on sale, these are amazing. And the compatibility with Samsung devices is amazing. Apple has a little pop up and that's it, these have a touchpad, their own separate equalizer, dual microphone setup(I obviously can't tell but in class I haven't heard any complaints thus far), they are very, very comfortable, more comfortable than Airpods I'd say(but I have never had one of these fall out, I workout almost everyday, and still have kit had an incident), and the sound quality is nothing short of prestigious. If it wasn't for the poor battery life(the buds themselves have 6 hours, but the case only has one full charge), and the clunky case(compared to the Airpoda case, which also has about triple the battery life of the Galaxy Buds case) this is an amazing product, and I would pay full price and be satisfied. If you are real stingy about the price try looking for them in specific carriers like ATT or Verizon, or wait until Best Buy where you can probably get a pair for 80 bucks, but all in all these are a great pair of buds, highly recommend, especially if you have a Galaxy device.",2019-05-08 18:02:34
467,Thankis for sharing. Those problems should definitely have been ironed out. And the connect with your phone thing is something Samsung shouldn't have advertised if it's not available.  Going off the complaints I've heard I'm assuming it's not.,2019-05-08 18:19:44

470,"Why are u asking on a Samsung subreddit then? Lol ...those battery apps aren't accute at all, you really can judge off them but if your phone is 3yrs old and it's the original battery in it then I'm sure it has depleted a bit over the years from usage just like any other battery would...phone batteries now a day's last 1-3 years depending on usage",2019-05-08 20:30:38

476,"Hello Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I have few questions regarding Samsung devices.

&amp;#x200B;

I am owner of Samsung Galaxy Tab A 2019 and Samsung A6.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know how to do the following.

&amp;#x200B;

1)

I would like to connect 1 Device to WIFI Network and then share this network to 2 Device (does not matter which one is connected to WIFI and which is sharing network)

I just can only connect to the WIFI directly using 1 device, and need to share network to the 2nd. But I cannot make a Hot Spot while connected to WIFI

2)

Samsung A6 has Split Screen option. Unfortunately applications running on the split screen does not work simultaneously. Only 1 application is active at a any given time.

Is there anyway to set both apps to be active ?

&amp;#x200B;

3) 

How I can prevent apps to ""disconnect"" while in the background ? (both devices)

Sometimes they disconnect within 5 secs...

&amp;#x200B;

4) Is there anyway I can create a shortcut on main screen with one of the Apps installed in Secure Folder ? So i don't have to open it and then open app.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks  in advance for any help  :)",2019-05-09 01:05:20

478,"OneUI needs some work. Same as Bixby Routines. Half the time the routines don't work, and I think OneUI has too many sub menus grouping too many settings together..... Hard to find some stuff when you're used to Android. Samsung should have an option to use OneUI or straight Android....",2019-05-09 02:50:37
479,"Before Samsung I used Sony and LG.
Don't really have any complaints about Sony. The Z3 Compact was an amazing phone and if Sony hadn't stopped improving their phones after that one, I'd probably have not switched (unfortunately they did with the results we see today).

LG on the other hand... Well, let's say my G4 was 3 months old and the motherboard simply died. And then LG took over a month to fix the problem. So much so that the S7 was meanwhile launched, I switched to it and never went back to LG. Nor will I go.

I also have some of the new HMD ""Nokia"" phones but they're crap. The P30 I really like the camera... But the rest of the phone is crap. I've become too accustomed to Samsung's more advanced version of Android and going back to those other brands just feels like an unworthy compromise. Although to be fair, with Samsung blocking rootless Substratum on the S10 and making root a nightmare on it, their phones no longer hold the same appeal to me so I'm not sure something won't show up in the future and convince me to switch.",2019-05-09 02:56:21

492,"I personally love the curved screen. Every screen is fragile, so this is too, but if you get a screen protector that shouldn't be an issue. 

The curved screen also nearly completely eliminates the side bezels, as it wraps around where they would usually be, giving a fuller and more immersive view.

There is a glare on the curves, but imo it actually looks nice. When using the phone, they way that things kind of flow off of the screen when you swipe gives it a really unique and interesting look. When watching Fullscreen video, you can see a slight difference in color from the main screen and the curves (just because of how OLED looks from an angle), but I don't think it impacts the viewing experience at all. If anything it makes it look a little better to me.

The curved screen also adds an interesting functionality; the edge screen. This means you can swipe from the very edge if the screen and bring up a panel of apps (that you choose), quick actions, your music, the weather, calendar, etc. This works on a flat screen, but I think with a case on a flat screen phone it's very difficult to access. I didn't think it was going to be something if actually use, but I put my most used apps there, and now I use it all the time.

People also talk about accidental touches. I use a very thin clear case, and I have only accidentally touched the edge 5 times at most since I've had the phone. If you have a case, you most likely won't have accidental touches, and if you do, there's an app in Goodlock (goodlock is a group of Samsung apps for extra customization) that can add dead zones to the edges so you don't accidentally touch the edges.

The curved screen also works great with a screen protector. Plastic and glass both work fine, the biggest difference is that the glass needs to have a LOCA application in order to work with the fingerprint sensor underneath the screen. I've applied two Whitestone dome screen protectors to my S10+, and it looks and works great, and doesn't hinder my fingerprint sensor at all.

Speaking of the fingerprint sensor, I know some people are going to say that the sensor under the glass is bad and/or doesn't work well. That's mostly not true. A lot of people never had any issues with it in the first place, and for people who did have issues with it, it got a few updates and now works even better, even with screen protectors.",2019-05-09 06:16:37

496,"There is a security setting where your phone will factory reset if the incorrect password is entered a few times (I think 5). Perhaps you were holding your phone and accidentally entering a password and that triggered a factory reset?

The other possibility is that someone who has access to your google or samsung account wiped the phone remotely.

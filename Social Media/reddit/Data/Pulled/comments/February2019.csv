14,"imessages benefit isnt that its free, its that it is far superior to SMS.  SMS is absolutely terrible and shouldnt even exist in its current form in 2019.  I use both a samsung galaxy S9+ and an iphone for work, and realistically they both basically do exactly the same thing. I like my S9+ was better though. I feel like the premium quality of the hardware which apple used to win hands down isnt an argument they can claim anymore. Samsungs S7 was almost there but not quite. The S8 and S9 and their note variants are absolute beautiful and premium feeling hardware. 

That being said iMessenger is the only thing i miss about iphone. and with good reason. when sending SMS the quality of images and videos are greatly reduced (if they even arrive at all.)  long texts are split up and arrive out of order sometimes (if the entire message even gets there at all) and interactive features in SMS are basically non existant. 

I make up for this but using facebook messenger as my default sms program and try to never sms anyone using it.  It took a year to get my old man on board with messaging me on facebook messenger rather than text. 

With the cameras being so good now on phones and pictures and videos are larger in filesize and quality, its such a huge step backwards to send someone a reduced quality picture or video that may never even arrive. ",2019-01-31 10:15:18

I looked at my billing a little while ago and the first two bills I got after the note 9 included the device charge, I need to see how far I paid and when I stopped getting charged. I used their online chat and they confirmed my device is paid in full which it isn't supposed to be until October. They've definitely got issues. The phones trade in right now is 500 and I know I paid at least 60 so if you ask me it's a rip off considering I'd still need a new device.

If you root a newer Samsung phone (example my s9+) it blows a fuse and you can always detect it.

Analog audio in smartphones is a thing of the past and humans more and more prefer the wireless life (see wireless charging), but decent quality wireless audio is becoming slightly cheaper over time, too. I don't have any numbers, but I imagine that a big percentage of people who live and die by the headphone jack are also using subpar headphones (including the ones that were supplied by Samsung with my S7, for example). 

We also shouldn't forget that this is an expensive flagship device. It's easy to assume from a business perspective that customers who can afford this can also afford bluetooth headphones.

91,"Personally I'd have made the same decision. I mean swiping up+press back vs one swipe to go back. I'd say that's an improvement and removal of what could be viewed as an unnecessary step. 
Also be because Android was never really intended to have that hide the navbar feature, and Android's new gesture based navbar likely broke that implementation. Samsung did say they are working on it to bring it back in a future update according to the beta feedback report summary. Remember that Samsung is just overlaying things on Android. If Google changes something on Android fundamentally and a Samsung function is sitting on that base, then that Samsung function stops working.
The navbar on Google never had that hide button IIRC. Samsung added that. Then Google straight up removed the navbar and replaced it with something different to accomodate gestures. This means the software underneath changed. It's not that easy to always retain legacy stuff, especially when the guys who make the base (Android) don't really seem to care about legacy stuff and expect people to keep up with them, and not bother to cater to those left behind.",2019-02-01 15:52:06
92,"I'm dealing with this right now.   Noticed the back panel coming separated from the frame on my S8 (14 months since purchase), and it smelled like nail polish remover, which as per my searches online was a clear battery problem.  I went to Samsung (Canada) support.  They indicated I should send it back to repair center for a free repair...  great.  

&amp;#x200B;

So I ship it to the repair center, they have it for a week, and today they email me saying the repair cost will be $624 after tax because they found corrosion in the phone (I assume water damage?).

&amp;#x200B;

Water couldn't have gotten into the phone if it wasn't bulging out the back panel in the first place.. but it still sounds like they won't honor the free repair.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife did say some water got splashed on the phone a couple weeks before I noticed the back panel was bulging out.. but the phone was performing just fine before and after that point, and right up to when i sent it in, it worked fine, I pulled a backup off it with no issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to get them to see the logic that it couldn't have possibly had any water damage if the back panel wasn't already bulging out, so the bulging battery broke the waterproofing seal, and then regular activities that wouldn't have caused water damage on the phone may have tripped some water sensors or caused some corrosion in the phone.. but to me that should be covered under warranty because the initial problem is the bulging battery which they said they would fix free of charge.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway.. just saying be careful sending things back to Samsung.  I'm hoping they'll change their mind on my repair and I can get my wife her phone back ASAP.. but right now it's not looking good.

Basically, Samsung waits for the carriers to certify that the update is working for their networks before pushing it. You don't want to get an update that suddenly doesn't allow you to use your phone as a phone right? So the unlocked won't be pushed until all carriers tell Samsung it's A-OK.

Knowing how the carriers treat you guys in the US, my guess here is the carriers are going, hey we earn more from the people getting their phones from us. Let's make the unlocked ones wait for certification so they can see our phones get updates faster so they'll buy from us.",2019-02-01 20:20:57

They can make completely new software (which they did) improve camera and performance (which they did) but all you gonna hear is oh it's same as last one (like wotyh s6 and s7.. like with s8 and s9) and all that just because they look similar.. In reality in both examples model above was better in terms of specs and software .. 

And that's why samsung needs to make that stupid looking hole in display so idiots like people I just described not going to say oh it's the same as before and even tho s9 look waaaay better they gonna buy this one cuz well look different and everybody knows that it is the latest model.. 

It sucks that people like that actually dictate the market rather than people that actually have style and don't mind keeping similar design until something truly futuristic and new is ready.. 

Like I would totally buy s10 if it just had bigger battery better software and slightly smaller bezels than s9.. This way I'm just gonna wait for either note 10 or not fucking buy this crap until they actually release something new..

I'm currently on note 8 and I'm perfectly fine with it.. I might get n9 in few months tbh bc id does have better battery and smaller bezels and if they gonna fuck up note 10 like this chances of me getting n9 instead of 10 are 100% .. 

They should really think about what the fuck are they doing.. First they fucked up they smartwatch line up (like why would you ditch so futuristic design of gear s that nobody else had to go for classic looking watch that is around for fucking hundreds of year just WTF?) Lime sure try the circular one but keep that gear s around and give it new life after 2y or so..

221,Yeah I do get all that - I was just confused about your specific complaint since your screenshot just shows your homescreen which as far as I can tell wouldn't have changed much since the OneUI update. The only thing that I found too terribly similar to Pie on a Pixel device is the rounded corners aesthetic on notifications and such. The settings menu is actually VERY Samsung in that it's their iteration of Pie which focuses on utilizing screen real estate for most efficient usage - this is not the case with Google devices. ,2019-02-04 11:27:32

‚ÄãFaster animations -- Go on your Note 9 and go into the settings, enter developer options (if you don't know how to do this then click here ), next up just scroll down until you find Window animation scale, Transition animation scale and Animator duration scale. Default they are set on 1x, change them to 0.5x or even off if that suits you. After you have changed all of them, your device will feel a lot faster.‚ú®

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Auto restart. Go on your Note 9 and go into settings, next go to Device Maintenance and tap the three dots in the top right corner and click on Auto restart. Turn on Auto restart and select your schedule and your phone will automatically reboot on your set time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Download YouTube Vanced, it's basically YouTube but a lot better. Videos can play in the background, no ads, supports 4k video quality if you enable it in the vanced settings and a lot more. Download it here or here from the official Vanced website. Also download MicroG to be able to log in to your YouTube account.‚ú®

YES it works on all devices

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Change your phone display resolution depending on what you are gonna do, personally I run the highest display setting which is 2960x1440 when watching movies, videos but when I play games I set it to the default resolution which is 2220x1080, perhaps you can go lower to 1480x720 if you have issues with frames when playing games but that should not be a problem on the Note 9.‚ú®

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Turn off edge panels if you don't want it. I hate it, so I disabled it and you can do that too in the settings of your phone. Just search for edge panels in the settings and you can disable them.‚ú®

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Enable blue light filter to put less strain to your eyes when using your device at night or when its dark outside. You can enable this or turn on a schedule in the display settings on your Note 9.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

One UI has more of a stock Android feel to it, and is centered around one hand usability and seems more intuitive to use.

OnePlus OxygenOS

1/ samsung galaxy s10 snapdragon 855 version (exynos version is a bit slower for games, still good overall). Coming in 3 weeks.

2/ oneplus 6/6t. Go with 6 if you really want 3.5mm jack (op6 has big notch and small battery 6h on screen time). Go with 6t if you prefer water drop notch, incredible battery life (up to 10h screen time) and charging speed (30m - 50%)

I prefer Oxygen OS over oneUI at the moment due to animation, smoothness, lock screen gestures (launch app or media control when you draw on lock screen). Also, oneplus pumps out update faster and more frequently than Samsung because they have much less devices.",2019-02-04 23:52:50

Apple can charge ridiculous amounts of money because they are the only ones using that software and iOS. Samsung cant justify their price. They have 3 cameras on the back where the Pixel has 1 and still takes better pictures in every aspect. Samsung doesn't have the most powerful phone anymore either because of Pixel being stuck android and having no bloatware.

9. I have the google camera app on my phone with functional night mode i can link it to you if u want(it works better on samsung cameras)
10. Samsungs AMOLED technology (pixels always have display issues blue tint, red tint, even screen burn in) everyone buys screens from samsung, ones that dont suffer the problems i mentioned.
11. Resale people actually wanna buy a samsung phone, noone cares about pixels they already look like last years phones whenever they launched.

I mean i did say im pretty loyal to samsung this was just a rant im probably gonna buy the s10 on launch day or if i can get my hands on it before.",2019-02-05 21:11:20

323,"Here's a list to contradict your list:

1) Samsung doesn't even like their own TouchWiz.  They had to rebrand it to ""One UI"" AKA copying Google's Pixel Launcher.
2) Samsung isn't getting rid of the headphone jack mainly because they made a long term investment in AKG. If they remove the headphone jack it's most likely it'll take a hit.
3) AKG headphones included in the box are straight out garbage. FIRST THING I threw out in gladly paired my airpods which I have ZERO delay.
4) Fast charging is irrelevant when it comes to Google's Pixel since the battery lasts so much longer than Samsung devices.
5) Atmos was licensed most likely because Samsung still can't get sound right. Google doesn't need Atmos because they sound excellent .
6) Ram is irrelevant when the Operating system is optimized correctly. My Google Pixel 2 XL handled multitasking, heavy gaming and heavy ram based apps better than my Samsung S9 Plus.
7) Oddly enough the notch isn't as distracting as peopl claim it is. Either way Samsung is not releasing notch based devices copying Apple as well.
8) Samsung Devices are beautiful, but they break easily compared to others. Just ask search YouTube and you'll get your answer.
9) Samsung's camera is garbage compared to the  either the Google Pixel 3's or even the Google Pixel 2's camera. Go a head, download a modes version of it ... Samsung cannot even get that right.
10) Amoled screens are over saturated and off colored. I cannot believe the color red looks ORANGE.
11) I was able to sell my Google Pixel 2 XL a few weeks ago for $700 CND one year after purchasing it.
12) 2 Year warranty.
13) Monthly Security updates.
14) Monthly Bug Fixes.
15) First to get the latest version of Android.
16) Guaranteed 3 years of Android Software upgrades.
17) As long as you own a pixel, Unlimited 24/7 support with a 1-1 agent either through call, text, or email (they can even take over your screen without installing 3rd party apps).

You can always down vote the comment, but remember ... You stared this thread complaining. The only reason why I purchased a Samsung S9 plus was to lower my plan from $100 a month for 5G's of data to $65 for the exact same plan AND got a free S9 Plus put of it. Would I recommend anyone this phone? NOPE ... It's not a bad phone overall but there are better options out there lol",2019-02-05 21:41:13
324,"If you have the Exynos processor then you can roll back and stay on it forever by rooting the phone. There's no update notification.

If you have a Snapdragon processor, you can roll back if you have the ""US Unlocked"" model, but it will still notify you to update your software and you cannot make it go away. You may even accidentally... install it. It's very annoying. If you have a ""Carrier"" model, you may be out of lock because they may prevent you from downgrading to an older firmware.

[https://www.sammobile.com/firmwares/](https://www.sammobile.com/firmwares/) 

You should backup contacts, text messages, pictures, videos, documents, and etc by using **Samsung Smart Switch**. You can try to backup the apps, but it may fail to restore them. This doesn't back up app data like offline single player games. Only TWRP and Titanium backup root required apps can do that. Downgrading firmware may cause you to lose data.",2019-02-05 21:43:36
325,"That's awesome but samsung never gave an exact date for any of their phones to receive updates... Only the month they are scheduled to get them then it always says ""there is a possibility this schedule can change"".... The quote I pulled that I been seeing from them is this...... ""Unlike other OEMs, Samsung certifies unlocked updates on all four carriers, which leads to delays.""

326,"The answer to number one doesnt make sense. Ill show you what it sounds like: ooh wait google doesnt even like oreo anymore cuz they call the new one pie omg look what happened google doesnt even like pie anymore theyre calling it whatever its gonna be with Q. 
2. I dont care why, i don't care about how they have it, i said i like them because they have it what kind of answer is that ooh they only have it cuz of xyz. I said i like the phones because it has headphone jack. Whats soo contradicting in ur list?
3. Thats your opinion i think they work pretty good.
4. Just because u don't have something it becomes irrelevant anyways having it is a plus i dont get how u can justify not having it. Its like me cutting ur arm off and going like i did u a favor by getting u a prosthetic.
5. Again maybe u havent experienced it but atleast to me it sounds better than my friends iphones x and xr. If u say u have the s9+ go to youtube and watch this video called dolby atmos s9+ test watch it with the dolby mode on and then u can try it on a pixel you will see the difference.
6. I hope you are joking about this, maybe u havent seen the speed tests the pixel had the worst ram management last year. Every phone was better than it but hey for some reason to you having less ram is more appealing (its becoming a trend in your list: i dont have this but yea it doesnt matter, so mine is better?)
7. I dont buy budget phones and neither is the pixel a budget phone samsung introduced those in the budget category where it should stay. This just shows what samsung thinks about it. You can say its not distracting but its something in the way and there is no way it wont bother you while watching a video. And how much screen real estate do u loose if u dont crop to fit?
8. I use cases and really good quality screen protectors. All phones break the pixel will break so will a samsung so will an iphone. Its not like the pixel is special or built like a tank. But still i must add the oled on Samsung phones work even after dropping 10 times. You can watch the drop tests. Most phones dont survive 5. The designs are beautiful and that was my reason to buy it my phone should look the latest. I would have the oppo find x if it had the headphone jack.
9. Maybe you should go check out dxo mark scores samsung is always on top or atleast  top 5. All those top 10 cameras are fantastic there is no such thing as a bad camera on a flagship phone today. all i said was i have the google camera app so i have the best of both worlds. Dont see anything wrong with that.
10. That problem with over saturation can be solved unlike the pixel u can actually change screen modes on samsung. There is adaptive which it comes with out of the box but u can change it to basic problem solved.
11. Thats good for you i live in the states its different here
12. In all my years of owning samsung phones ive never needed the warranty the phones are built really well. But yea i agree on that, peace of mind is good and i would like that with samsung too didnt know they had that.
13. Mine gets those too every other month havent seen any changes to it. But they did add some features like the video wallpaper and slow motion to the s8. But monthly updates is why i started this thread and i agree thats something Samsung lacks. But i can tell you something u will never get ur headphone jack back through an update but samsung can add all those features through different softwares and stuff.
14,15,16. Good points and that is why i started this thread samsungs lack of software updates and its a problem they need to fix.

I have to add all these answers apply differently to different people maybe u like bluetooth headphones thats your choice, maybe i like my screen over saturated and you dont. There are somethings that u can get with different apps and softwares and then there are somethings u cant get like headphone jack and lack of a notch but again like i said u might  be able to accept a phone with a notch, i cant. When i wanna spend 800$+ on a phone i do alot of research those were my reasons to buy samsung because thats what appealed to me. ",2019-02-05 22:30:57

404,"God, that's a tough one lol.

I love(d) the pixel software until Pie, it really went to shit after that, so take that as my bias.

It's literally an upgrade to everything. A proper upgrade, compared to the Pixel 3 XL.

Geez, I guess I miss call screening when I briefly had it. Never really looked back though because the note is literally an upgrade to everything. The software is a bit overwhelming going from minimalist to max. embrace it though, it's an enjoyable experience if you desire to upgrade.

Sorry if that's a bit vague. Here's if I were to directly compare my note 9 to the OGXL.

Camera: I miss the simplicity of a point and shoot, no stupidity kinda deal with the Pixel. The note 9 though, is so much more modern. 4k60 is nuts, OIS &gt; EIS, portrait mode, etc. It's like it's from this century with features that are great. Pictures also instantly process. I know sometimes the XL can be stupid and take forever- yeah no that doesn't happen on the Note these days.

Battery: EASILY, the Note or S9. The battery kinda went to shit on the XL for me, but charged so much faster than the Note. I will honestly give it that. If I went to take a shower with the XL dead, it'd be at like 60% when I was done. Note on the other hand, more like 25-30. However, the Note can get me up to 8hrs SOT with 20 hours use, and over a day and a half if I don't abuse it. Not even a joke. My XL I'd only get 3-4. Not even a joke, like you'll see these typical battery pushers who leave the screen on all day, getting 6 on the pixel and whatever on the note, yeah no I'm talking practically here. The charge is worth the extra battery. 

Build: No questions here, the Note 9 absolutely destroys the pixel in terms of build. When I first used the Note, it actually blew me away with the screen size, and how more uniform and solid it feels. Not much to say, hold the phone and you'll understand why. Also you can use your phone in the rain so that's a bonus and wirelessly charge it, but that's basic knowledge.

Software: If you're worried about the horror stories of past where OEM skins literally destroyed Android, well I can say the specs caught up, and the note is lag free for the most part. Trust me, I came from an LG G4 before the XL. That phone was a disaster in terms of software and hardware. Obviously updates are going to take an eternity. One UI is trimmed, and a lot less disgusting than what tw was. People like Samsung for a reason.

I hope this helps! If there's any small questions you have, ask away.",2019-02-07 13:42:43

492,Theoretically it's going to become a thing with the S10 with UI accent that matches the color of the phone. Still you can email Samsung and ask them why they still haven't implemented accent changing,2019-02-09 11:11:03
493,"In EU Samsung has a 3 year warranty (2 years from the store and 1 year from Samsung itself)

Still it looks like a panel switch which might be pretty expensive since it's most of the TV.

Though do contact support and if it doesn't work out you can ask a repair company (a new TV might be cheaper at that point).",2019-02-09 12:36:02

Still waiting for OTA on my note 9.",2019-02-09 14:32:33

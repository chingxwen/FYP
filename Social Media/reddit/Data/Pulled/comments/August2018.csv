There are always going to be ""the next best thing"" coming out and it's always going to seem like a waiting game.

I think the S9 and the S8 are very similar. I wouldn't get another S7, if I were you. I don't even know if you can brand new ones from stores anymore. 

If you're looking for something more budget friendly and if you want a flat screen instead of the curved screen, the new A8 looks pretty slick. I work in a cell phone store and the A8 is outselling the S series right now. For every S8 or S9 we sell, we sell at least two A8's. Most people picking the A8 are coming from Samaung S5, S6, and LG G4 and G5.  Most S7 users are picking the S9, though. I think their thought process is that if they are going to upgrade to another S series, they might as well get this year's version  and not last year's version. ",2018-08-01 01:10:44

iOS is simple which is preferred by many and Android's limitless potentials are also loved by many. On top of the OS difference, Samsung has even more features than standard Android. There can be a steep learning curve for new users. But just play with it and try it out, most of the things are intuitive.

Apps wise, most of the popular apps on iOS are also available on Android, so start with them.

Second, no, 8.1 is not possible. Even Samsungs flagships are on 8.0.0. Why? Because 8.1 was mostly bug fixes and features compared to 8.0, and Samsung phones already have those features, and if there are bugs, a small system update is used to eliminate them. Long story short, upgrading to 8.1 is just unnecessary and would cost a lot of time and money with no gain.

And third, people always cry after an update, even about totally unrelated issues. Usually a system update is a good thing, bringing further optimisation, performance and features.",2018-08-02 05:44:07

DO NOT USE THE PHONE, remove the sd card and get a memory card reader to hook it directly to your pc, SD cards are far easier to recover than internal storage on phones. Also, the more you use a storage device, the less likely you are to recover older deleted partitions.

Try Recuva, Lazesoft data Recovery and EaseUS Data Recovery. These are some of the best IMO.

I would consider myself to be an ""average heavy user."" If I am not at work and using my phone for marathon Netflix/games, I will obviously have to charge midday. 

 Coming from iPhone, I love the quick charge on the s9. It is perfect for those ""top up charges"" midday. 

So the whole point of this is that while battery performance is important, it doesn't matter at the end of the day because all smartphones are going to need to be charged daily and all smartphones are going to need a midday top up every once in a while. ",2018-08-04 03:07:15

- Flat screen, not curved, which a lot of users like. It is bigger than the 5s but it is still one-handed 

- Excellent performance for a mid tier phone 

- Because it is mid tier, the phone is less expensive than the S series phones and on cheaper plans for most carriers 

- Great camera quality, nice screen for watching videos, and it can do everything you need it to do

- I like the way the screen looks on the X when watching videos.


What I like about the s9:

- The Dolby sound is super nice and the sound makes up for the slightly more saturated look when watching Netflix or YouTube 

- The quick charge is super convenient 

- I have better data connectivity when I have my SIM in the S9. It's faster and I have less ""no service"" issues

If it wasn't for that I probably would've kept it and got a new battery for it but My brother in law had an OG pixel and that was so smooth still when compared to s7e. 

I jumped on a prime day deal for the essential phone and have been loving it. Had Samsung released the note 9 last month I would've bought that because i really felt I needed a new phone and I was dead set on that. But since trying stock Android, I've really liked having the blank canvas that is my phone. So now.... I'm not too sure what I would do when it comes to getting my next new phone and decided to give myself a year with this phone to see if I want the pixel 4 or note 10, or even see if this phone holds up well enough to keep.

135,"Yeah, I still don't see why phone manufacturers seem to be okay with the current battery life. If you made a survey asking people with a smartphone (doesn't matter which OS or brand), I'm positive almost 100% people would say they want a better battery life. A lot of progress has been made in the last couple of years sure, but the fact that a ""heavy"" user still needs to charge throughout the day seems kinda unrealistic. Especially considering heavy use on a phone won't ever come near the heavy use a computer can do (rendering 4k footage for example). 

Just seems stupid to me when companies like Huawei can fit a 4000 mAh battery in their P20 Pro but Samsung can't in their Plus-sized phone with a higher pixel count and more ""features"" that require battery (such as AOD). Some argue that quick charing makes up for it, and to an extent I can agree. But there are situations where you are unable to charge and it may screw you over big time.

Just a few weeks ago I flying home from Berlin to Stockholm, and the flight was delayed by 2 hours or so. There was no charger near me (trust me, I checked about every corner and place near my gate), and my phone was running low on juice due to it being used quite a lot throughout the day. So now I had like 35% battery, over 4 hours until I get home. Sure the phone survived, but was I able to do much, if anything on it? Not really. Those are the situations where you really need that extra juice. Or if you're on the buss on the way home, or on a train with no charging ports. It is getting more usual to have chargers on busses and trains nowadays, and longer flights too. But still, until we are there, the consumers are the ones to suffer for the companies and their greed.

The z3 launched just recently and it is said to have a 3000 mah battery. Why don't they make the battery like 3500 or something? Because they want their customers to buy that battery moto mod to increase battery. They want you to spend more money on that. Same thing with Apple and Samsung.

Had it for 2 years and I can say that it's very sturdy in terms of durability and water resistance. Everytime I see a scratch on it, it just turns out to be some sort of paint scratched off from a wall. Worth the money!

I'm in the US and use AT&amp;T and have two questions. I've been told to get the unlocked version to avoid bloatware from the carrier. If I do this, would I still get the Snapdragon 845 version or would it be the Exynos? The Snapdragon is usually a little faster so I'd prefer it.

* Storage: 128GB or 512GB
* RAM: 6GB (128GB version) or 8GB (512GB version)

I was under the impression that the whole reason Samsung Pay is enabled to use the Magnetic strip Tech was all because they made a deal with each bank to use the token system through the Magnetic strip tech.

298,"I’m honestly thinking of trading my iPhone X for the Note 9.

I’ve been a heavy iPhone user. I’ve owned every model except the 5C, and the 8 and 8+. 

I’ve also owned the galaxy s7, note 7, note 8, and s8+. 

I love my X, primarily for the camera. I have kids and take lots of photos. Currently have 14k photos and 2.5k videos. 

What I’ve enjoyed about the Samsung phones that I don’t get with the iPhone is the following:

- micro SD compatibility
- more customization
- ability to download torrents and easily transfer to pc
- seemed to have more success streaming sports
- I LOVE the s-pen
- I was able to use two telegram accounts on a single phone (used to use a separate account for communicating with coworkers) 
- the cameras were still nice, though photos had different qualities
-seemed more like a pocket pc and less like a smartphone


What I like more about iOS/iPhone :

- Gestures and swiping are much smoother imo
- the video quality has always trumped the Samsung IMO
- iMessage is awesome if you know many people with iPhones
- airdrop is amazing for sharing photos
- FaceTime
- The simplicity (and lack of customization) makes for a more straight forward UI
- Apple Watch &gt; Samsung Gear (excited to see what galaxy watch has to offer)

That’s all I can think of off the top of my head. Happy to answer any questions.

The pens still use the same customized passive Wacom EMR tech to function. Meaning the device itself has to have the specific Samsung variant of Wacom's digitizer built into the screen.

So only other Notes, Tab S3 and S4, Tab A with S Pen, and other Galaxy Note tablets (ETA: oh, also the old Wacom-equipped Surface too, since it uses the same pen frequency). It likely doesn't even work on a Wacom tablet or Cintiq, just as previous S Pens didn't (and vice versa for Wacom pens on Galaxy devices).

The 'bluetooth' pairing function has nothing to do with the actual pen input. Just the button on the barrel. It's good for about 200 clicks then can be recharged in the phone in about 40 sec. The S Pen input still functions without a charge. The button still works while touching/hovering over the screen without a charge.

Also, it isn't straight-up Bluetooth. The pen does not show up in the Bluetooth device list and works while Bluetooth is shut off. It uses something else to pair.

That price is hard to swallow. I wouldn't pay that for a phone without the commitment to long term support.

Wish Samsung would either really innovate with software by going their own direction, or go stock. This ""sort of stock+some tricks"" approach ends up the worst of both worlds, they can't really fix Androids more fundamental problems, but when Google finally fix things themselves, they can't benefit from it because they're 9 to 12 months behind integrating upstream updates.

341,"First off, if I have the slightest feeling or if the phone has anything wrong with it like how it functions or if the lid is cracked anywhere, I will definitely not attempt to use that phone to trade in, just because I feel like that's how large companies tend to operate their policies and terms of normal wear and tear. On any typical day I usually resell my phone with a charger and case, but thought I'd try out this trade in program for the first time. I have also enjoyed my Samsung phones and experiences with Samsung customer service. I figured the price Samsug was offering was anywhere from $50 to $150 less than the actual value of the phone being traded in to them.

So I participated in the Samsung Trade In Program back on January 30, where I traded in my LG V20 in great condition without any problems or issues of any kind. On June 22, Samsung emailed me stating my phone did not meet the requirements due to damaged housing and buttons. So my Samsung credit account that I opened for the trade in program was charged $225 as they kept my trade-in phone for $25. I have emailed back and forth with Samsung customer service and at least three different representatives have responded now. Everyone responds with the same reason but no one is able to provide any kind of images or reports of any kind that prove my phone is damaged.

I find this scam Samsung is pulling to be very unethical and I want to make sure I get the word out. There's no way I can continue shopping for Samsung after this issue, I only hope they improve their wrong ways and provide the service I have come to know since the Galaxy S2. One of the email responses from Samsung also included the terms of the trade in, and I thought the arbitration agreement to be interesting in this moment. Here is what it says:

11. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT Any dispute you may have with Samsung arising out of or relating to the Trade-In Program or these Terms shall be governed by the Arbitration Agreement (including its 30-day opt-out provision) included in the Samsung Terms and Conditions that apply to the New Samsung Device you purchased using the Trade-In Program. For more information about your rights, obligations, opt-out opportunities and the full terms of the Arbitration Agreement, see [www.samsung.com/us/Legal/Phone-HSGuide/](https://www.samsung.com/us/Legal/Phone-HSGuide/), the printed materials enclosed in the box, or the Legal section of the settings menu of the New Samsung Device you purchased using the Trade-In Program (typically in the “About Device” or “About Phone” section). As stated in such Arbitration Agreement, you agree that any such dispute shall not be combined or consolidated with a dispute involving any other person’s or entity’s claim related to the Trade-In Program, and specifically, without limitation of the foregoing, shall not under any circumstances proceed as part of a class action.

352,"I have been a loyal Samsung customer for several years and are very familiar with the company as a whole. Our last purchases was a refrigerator  with the Family Hub technology and an S9+ phone. We purchased the Samsung Series 8 curved TV in 2016 (UN65KS8500) and enjoyed the 4K technology along with all of the other bells and whistles. It has been a great TV until last month when the TV stopped working. It has been an experience working on getting this fixed. The Samsung customer service in a polite way told me you are on your own we can not help you because your TV is out of warranty. Note, this was a $2,400 investment (TV and sound bar) that cam highly rated by many consumer groups and people alike. At the time of purchase I did not feel like we needed an extended warranty because my two other Samsung TV's are working great (Although my oldest one we had to replace one of the boards in it and it cost \~$300 to get it fixed) and this was one of their premium TV's and \~$300 more dollars for a 3 year extended warranty seemed like a waste of money at the time.

I contacted customer support again and paid for a tech to come out and take a look at the TV and he told me that the control panel was bad and it would cost $1,300 for the panel plus labor. Needless to say I was livid as to how a lightly used 2 year old TV can stop working. For the last couple of weeks I have been reviewing and posting on Samsung's community forum and to my amazement there are several people in my position with the same problem. The general consent from the Samsung moderators is, ""We are sorry to hear this"" to all of us with issues. In a nutshell they are telling us too bad, buy another TV. This TV was an investment not a disposable entity. I am horrified to think if our other products were too fail after the one year warranty was to expire. We were never asking for a replacement or to fix the TV for free but to pay for a repair greater than what the TV is worth is ridiculous! We are now considering other manufacturers if we decide to purchase another TV.

What I would like to convey to you or anyone else is do your homework on all aspects of major purchases especially reliability and warranties. ",2018-08-09 18:39:07

375,If only Spotify didn't have specific bugs for Samsung...,2018-08-10 00:53:21
376,"Do notification sounds e.g. from WhatsApp come out the phone's speaker when headphones are plugged in, when the phone is on sound?

Furthermore, with headphones plugged in, do notification sounds come through the headphones when the phone is set to vibrate? 

Would be really helpful if you could answer this one. 

EDIT - Additional information:

All my Samsung devices thus far have had this issue where notifications play through both the loudspeaker and headphones when headphones are plugged in. I find it extremely annoying because I plug in my headphones not to disturb other people. So when I realised this I started putting my phone on vibrate - but then no notification sound comes through the headphones. 
I'm starting to believe this may be the case with all Samsung devices. If you don't believe me, try it. If you find a Samsung device that doesn't have this issue then please let me know",2018-08-10 01:42:07

389,"Cool. I did just this yesterday, my main phone was an iPhone X, secondary is a iPhone 6S. Now switched my main phone to a black 128GB Note 9. Indeed, it's a beast. Screen wise and speed wise. I really like the hardware, but getting used to that Samsung layer on top of Android is hard. For instance; they don't use the normal library of Smiley's that for instance you have on your iPhone, they made some cartoon versions of it that look like it's made for children, without the option to replace it.
I guess in a short while a custom ROM will be available that has stock Android (because of Project Treble), so I will try that once it's ready!",2018-08-10 06:21:08

393,Probably because Samsung is tired of the Note 7 jokes when none of their phones have exploded for over 2 years. ,2018-08-10 07:13:41
394,I think because they're getting tired of people beating the dead horse about Samsung phones being exploded. ,2018-08-10 07:13:59
395,"Here's my story.. I ordered from Samsung with the upgrade program. Says they can't verify me for financing. Several calls later with TD Bank and I'm approved after jumping through many hoops. Silence from Samsung. So I look in my account.. No orders and I place a new one.. It shows the financing. Now I get an email from Samsung saying my order it cancelled because I've exceeded the program limits. I contact Samsung and they said they would escalate it..a week later I've heard nothing

So I cancelled and ordered through Amazon with 1 year financing through Amazon credit card.. Saved like $150. And at the end I will own it and can sell it",2018-08-10 07:17:47
396,"My guess would be yes, but I have no insight on this. It seems that it's exclusive to the recent flagship Samsung devices. It will be open across all Android in the near future, so my guess is that once it's widely available that as long as your phone specs can handle it (A8+ should), then it won't be a problem. That's just my thoughts. It won't run as well as the S8 or Note8 or greater, but should be playable. ",2018-08-10 07:18:58

403,Samsung customer service is awful. I had a similar experience recently with a smart watch. They couldn't do anything for me. Overall made me have less respect for Samsung as a company and will never use the financing again.,2018-08-10 08:15:40
404,"Thanks, was planning on trading in my S7 edge and was unsure on which to choose. I figure if I do the Samsung Upgrade and they come out with amazing features in Note 10 I could upgrade anyways.",2018-08-10 08:52:41

Everytime a new version comes out like pie, it's not a simple as pushing a button and allow all phones to get the update.

414,"I will say that yeah the updates are slow but samsung is normally ahead of stock Android, so we have features that are yet to be introduced. Also the S7 just got Oreo which makes that it's third OS which does show it still supports older devices. I'm thinking of switching to iPhone just because of iMessage. Group chats suck on Android, but the note 9 is enticing",2018-08-10 10:55:45

With factory unlocked firmware:
- VoLTE (HD Calling)
- Visual Voicemail (via Samsung Galaxy pushed app)

You won't get:
- Wi-Fi Calling (such as it is with Verizon, LOL)
- Video Calling

If you flash Verizon firmware, you'll add:
- Wi-Fi Calling
- Video Calling (only if you put your SIM in a real Verizon device temporarily and remove the service block on My Verizon or the site)

Honestly, the two features you lose on unlocked with Verizon are pretty worthless, IMO (especially WiFi Calling, VZW really gimps that feature). So I'd leave it on unlocked.

EDIT 2: Dammit, I give up.",2018-08-10 13:13:03
428,"The not is gonna be a siginficant difference from the s8, if it was the s9 I'd say hold off. Battery life and taking notes on the go is good for college plus any online work you can somewhat  do on your phone. Youd still be able to get the headphones if Verizon has the Samsung pre order bundle listed. Also at T-Mobile you can get $500 off of the note with a trade in.

- Switch your resolution to qhd+, it's so much better

437,"It has more to do with getting new features in my opinion. You have to buy a new phone, a new version of Android with new features is free. I fully understand all the reasons why Samsung is relatively slow at pushing out full OS updates, and I totally get that Samsung Experience has features stock Android doesn’t, but for example Android P sounds amazing. A lot more interesting than iOS 12. And yet, if I want it, I’m basically forced into getting a Pixel (as far as I understand the landscape anyway. If I’m wrong please please correct me!)",2018-08-10 15:44:15

I just put her on hold and called samsung and merged the calls together, explained to the samsung rep what was going on and  he validated that the order was canceled and TD bank instantly reversed the charges.  I was able to put in my order for a 128GB Note 9 =) It worked out as well as I was able to get a student discount with my unidays account. ",2018-08-10 16:03:15
439,"Thanks for the info I really appreciate it. I don't have a Note 8 but I am thinking about getting the Note 9.

I find it extremely annoying because I plug in my headphones not to disturb other people. So when I realised this I started putting my phone on vibrate - but then no notification sound comes through the headphones. 
I'm starting to believe this may be the case with all Samsung devices. If you don't believe me, try it. If you find a Samsung device that doesn't have this issue then please let me know. 

Dare I say the dreaded i-word...on Apple devices all sound (ringer, notifications, media) are routed through the headphones only when they are plugged in. The only exception are alarms which play though both the headphones and the loudspeaker. 

This might seem picky but it's everyday use cases like this that rub me the wrong way. Yes, it is possible to download third party apps to solve this issue. But I really do feel, that when you are spending this much on a device, the basics should just work out the box. Furthermore, if there are third party apps that solve this issue why can't Samsung have something in their own sound settings - according to your comment there are on certain devices. I sadly don't see this setting on J5 2016, A3 2017, S4, Note 4,  or the S6.

Sorry for the long comment. But I wanted to give a comprehensive reply. I may edit my question because upon reviewing it, it doesn't seem as poignant as I'd like it to be. 

Once again thank you for your reply. 

Hold me hostage if you will....

468,"The market is segmented into groups, all varying from the person still using a flip phone to people with the latest and greatest. **It all depends on what's more important TO YOU**. All day long I have conversations with people about the features and benefits of newer phones - losing a headphone jack vs. better battery life, bigger screen, or other features and it becomes a minor annoyance, but never a dealbreaker - and Samsung has done exceptionally well with keeping the jack in ALL their phones. As someone who has a S9 with the AKG tuned earbuds, they are excellent earbuds.. and I've already lost a pair of BeatsX. I'll be getting a pair of the Gear IconX soon, but charging the buds is always a pain in the ass and probably why people still like plugging in their earphones - it's one less thing you need to think about, and **plugging it in guarantees it will just work**.",2018-08-11 07:46:24

Also the SOS function works from my watch, as does find my phone, weather and so on. Haven't seen anything that doesn't work as it would with a samsung device. As posted earlier Samsung pay won't work. But the fit2 pro doesn't have that option anyways, only nthe watches do. And I use Google pay anyways, have even before I went to a pixel.

Simmer down, dude... it's just a joke. 


I was thrilled when I found out this thing charges through my case (which I thought was impossible, since the case doesn't let the official Samsung charger charge through it), and I've loved the brand back when I got my first alarm clock in college that came with all the cradles for different iPods (pre-iPhone)... so when I noticed this and found it humerous, I figured people here would get a kick out of it, too.

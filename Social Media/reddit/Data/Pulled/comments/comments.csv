Personally I prefer android but it's all unique to the person I guess
"I currently run a Note 10+ and an iPhone 11 Pro. The Note is amazing for media consumption. Android does really well with PiP and Split and the large screen is phenomenal for it. Also, for my setup file management is easier on the Note. Want to d/l Usenet, Torrents or files from your Plex server no problem as Android allows background task running. Also, a lot more choices for the apps on Android. You also have the option of expandable storage so you can sync more content.

My iPhone is my choice for my social media apps and photography. I find taking and editing pictures more pleasant on iOS. Plus, the quality and quantity of the editing apps combined with iOS color management across apps is superb. For these cases I prefer Apple for its background app management. I get rock solid consistent battery on the go. Where with Android it can be unpredictable. When I first switched I just uploaded my iCloud photos to Google Photos and then deleted the iCloud library backup and turned it off. Kept an archived copy on my server just in case. Now everything just gets backed up to Google and then within Google photos I use the free up device storage after the backup is finished.

If you’re like me and really into tech and open minded to both platforms I think you’ll really enjoy it. For support, as a tech literate person, I just learned to figure it out on my own. The curve was relatively small. But, any Samsung forum or reddit is a great choice. Learn how each best suites your certain usage scenarios and learn to utilize it for those. If you have any other questions I’d be glad to assist."
I think you won't be able to fully enjoy it unless you make the Note your primary phone. Using it all the time to it's fullest and experiencing what it's all about.

"I've read 2 years of major OS upgrades and then another 2 for security updates.

The S7 is still getting security updates and that phones 3 years old now."
"Performance wise, easily 3 to 4 years. However the battery is gonna take a hit long before it starts to slow down.

When you start a phone battery at 3100mah in the s10e, its its all down hill from there. 

But if you got say a 4000+ battery,  then even when the battery degrades down to 3000mah you still can make it through the day"
"Aside from the battery, 3 years easily."
Up to 4 years on average
"The S8 doesn't have Dual SIM. At least in most markets.

If the card doesn't fit, your phone most likely doesn't support it. The second slot would be for a SD card."
It's most probably for the SD card and not for the 2nd sim. Avoid trying unless you're sure it you might damage something.

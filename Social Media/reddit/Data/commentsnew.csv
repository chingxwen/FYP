2,"For sure, the Snapdragon cannot be rooted. The Exynos can. Something about the ""bootloader being locked"".

I think it's one of the reasons why many people, myself included, are so furious with Samsung's lack of update support. Samsung has always given their phones only 2 new android versions after release. If they refuse to keep our devices on the latest version, they should at least give us back the option to do it ourselves. 

It sucks because the Note 8 is still a very capable and powerful device and cheaper/weaker Samsung phones are getting Android 10 just because they're newer, not necessarily because they can run it well.",1579535381,samsung,1579506581.0,"{'body': 'For sure, the Snapdragon cannot be rooted.

6,"You could also download an custom rom. I mean samsung is usually in front when it's about adaption rate of new features. For example on the pixel phones it's not possible to have call regarding while with samsung it depends on which csc is installed. They also have for example implemen features which google would release a new os for. With one ui 2.1 you probably have most of the android R features already. And so on.

The s5 still receives security updates. Creating a new os takes manpower and costs money. That one time payment usually is for the hardware, R&amp;D and software.

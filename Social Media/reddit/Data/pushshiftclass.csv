I don’t have that promo going (Att) but all the other stores around ours (Verizon, t mobile, etc.) all have the marked up price of 914.99+tax and are running a 200 off promo (price in the Samsung store) In general buying from Samsung or Best Buy or one of those places can usually be cheaper, and equipment changes are very easy for us as long as your phone is AT&amp;T ready. We charge like 5$ for SIM cards (can coupon on new activations) so that might be the route you want to go.

"I worked in a cell phone booth for a little bit during Christmas and I can tell you that Samsung really does cover most of the bases when it comes to price, they have their introductory J series followed by the mid-range A series, and then there S Series and the notes. More than likely if Apple does release a newer phone at a lower price rate it would be replacing the iPhone SE which was essentially an iPhone 6 in an iPhone 5 case. The newest phone in the mid-range series for Samsung is the A8 which essentially was just a refresh of an A5 but with better pieces inside. So I doubt Samsung would come out with another phone for a while seeing that they just did one.",2018-07-01 23:16:05
"Far from the best in every catagory, except for processor but thats just for those tasks but all the other hardware holds it back way to far and the better specs of android make it a much cleaner experience especially if you get a launcher like nova, as for display he must be joking my brother is so pissed at himself for buying the x and his biggest gripe is that while the display is nice it just doesnt compare to the samsung displays god and its not just that

Iphones are decent in all catagories but android is just far superior, you make the phone look like you want and change how it functions entirly (plus you could easily get any app or song for free without breaking warrenty) 

I cant get myself to get any apple products because each one just becomes more and more of a cashgrab with each product, and theu would only really be worth the price and a 40-50% discount

Also apple and innovation dont really gp together, especially not the design up untill rhe 6 and x it was the same peice of crap phone design (not to mention blatently leaving in a bend gate to cut production costs), but the most innovative design was the xaomi mi mix until the, galaxy until the Find X (which might i add was an absolutly perfect way to hid the front facing components",2018-07-02 00:54:52
"I kind of don't get it, probably out of the loop pretty bad, but what were the issues between the two?

I just always assumed it was the OS and maybe a display or two on models since Android models rock different display properties. 

(Last iPhone I had was a 5 and switched back to Android after due to iTunes never working right, everything wanting to sync bothered me as I try to keep my phone a brick as much as possible and hate developers butting in, and lack of home screen customization. There was also a case where I lost all my music, photos, and contacts when my phone did an auto update and over the phone I was snobbly told to back up and that apple products work better together WHEN why is something that is supposed to INSTALL something doing the exact opposite of that by DELETING files... in apps that are apple certified so it's not like a third party mishap. 

Haven't gone back to apple since that one and have had an s5 and 3 s7's after so idk the full details but some of the features now are either niche, lack proper support, or is pushed in models for consumer feedback. Like I highly doubt Samsung would take audio ports out of their phones like Apple tried to do on the 9 or 10 hehe.)",2018-07-02 02:05:52

* download ADB for your particular computers' OS (linked in the above article)
* Enable developer mode on your phone
* Use the above guide and the ADB commands to uninstall the application

"Welcome to the best decision you've made in a while ;)

Seriously though.  I had the first iPhone all the way through (each phone in between) to the iPhone 5.  Had 3 iPads.  And 4 iPods from the original metal spinning hard drive to the later model touch sreens etc.  And I dabbled in iOS developing 3 apps that used to be on the app store (made a few hundred on em).

Then I switched to Galaxy/Android one day after having a few hours to toy around on a friend's

I've now gone from every Galaxy from that point to the Note 3, 4, 5, 7, 7 (lol), and now the 8.

Since then I have switched my parents from iPhones and iPads to Galaxys and Samsung tablets.  My wife too although she was just on an old LG something which was android so she doesn't count haha.

Why am I spouting off about ALL of that?

1) Shows I am not just an android fan boy, I had plenty of exposure to apple garbage.  Honestly I STILL believe apple was better up until around the iPhone 5 when Samsung started flying past them.

2) Shows even the excuse ""But I don't need all that extra shit, I am a simple person and prefer the training wheels style of apple"" is still not true as my parents are old and retired and absolutely love their new Android overlords and are now on their 4th or 5th phones.

3) Despite the Note 7 fuck up, I'm still here and loyal and honestly could not be happier with my current phone, and my past ones (even that Note 7 was bad ass).  Love my wife's new phone.  And we have my son on an LG G6 which is nice too.

P.S. Your favorite thing about Android will be watching Apple commercials when they announce 'new' features and you giggle as we've had that for YEARS now.

P.P.S. If you're looking for those ""must have"" apps I won't go off on an extensive list but Nova Launcher is a must and is worth the money for Pro.

Really? The selling point for me and Samsung is Knox/security. Your contracted repairmen are making customers sign off their data if there's a defect covered under warranty. This is a BIG hole in the security.



Just venting. Tell me what you all think. I'm considering going on Twitter. Samsung called me to follow up on the repair with a survey and the lady claimed she had no idea that was the issue.

"I work in retail selling TVs, computers, cameras, etc. There's MUCH more to what makes a TV other than the screen size and resolution. 

The most basic, other than resolution, would be the panel type. More expensive panels have better colour reproduction, better viewing angles, and tend to be held to a higher quality control standard so tend to last longer. At the highest end of these panels currently available to consumers would be Samsung's QLED, and LG/Sony's OLED. OLED has the advantage of getting perfect blacks as each LED generates it's own light, eliminating the need of a backlight, and allowing OLEDs to be the most colour accurate panels. However, QLED is brighter, so it works better in a brighter room, and it doesn't have the risk of burn-in like OLEDs have.

Then there's what type of backlighting the TV uses. For simplicity I'll keep it to edge lighting, and full array lighting. Edge lighting is cheaper, but you get the drawbacks of worse image and colour quality, and you can notice dropoffs in brightness on certain parts of the screen. Full array lighting has LEDs spread all behind the panel for a more uniform and consistent backlight.

High Dynamic Range (HDR) is a feature that has become more common on TVs in the past few years. [Linus over here can explain it better than I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wthhc1s0Pig). 

Next is 4K upscaling. Almost no cable signal does 4K, unless you have a fiber optic TV box. So to get your standard cable signal filling up the full 4K screen, the TV has to upscale the signal, which basically means it has to generate extra pixels that weren't originally there. Generally, the more expensive the TV, the better the upscaling is. Right now Sony seems to have the best upscaling chips. Of course, you can get 4k content from online sources, or from a 4K Blu-Ray player with 4K disc though.

Other than that, as you pay more, Smart TV functionalities tend to be better and more snappy, speakers get better, etc. 

The main reason I would rather buy a TV from the big guys (Samsung, Sony, LG), rather than the small guys (Hisense, RCA, etc.) is overall quality and support. You will experience MUCH better support from the bigger companies, not only in customer service, but also in setting up third party devices such as universal remotes, etc. The big guys tend to have more authorized service centers also, where as you're pretty much out of luck with the small guys.",2018-07-03 13:58:33

"Thank you for posting this. I traded in my phone in in early February. 4.5 months later, in late June, my credit card was charged. I was told by Samsung that the phone had liquid damage. 

1. It did not. It was in excellent condition. 
2. I carefully went through the Terms and Conditions before sending my phone in, making sure it met each one. Nowhere is liquid or water damage listed in the T&amp;C. 
3. Samsung had the phone for over 4 months before discovering any damage. It sounds like the damage occurred while in Samsung's care, as yours did. 

I initialized a dispute with my credit card company very soon after the charge was made. I have contacted Samsung 7 times via phone and email, and they have been incredibly unhelpful.  The first representative said he couldn't find any evidence of liquid damage, which he thought was odd, nor could he find anything in the T&amp;C about liquid damage. They are still charging me, though. This post encouraged me to contact the BBB, which I have just done. We've been Samsung customers for a long time, but I am now seriously rethinking the purchase of any future products. Thank you OP. ",2018-07-04 12:33:10

"Only had my S9+ for a week. After 2 days Bixby had to go. 90% because button. A damn dedicated physical button in an inconvenient place for a single app/tool that a meaningful portion of owners will never use. Every button is an extra inlet for potential water damage on a phone that's supposed to be pretty strongly water resistant.

Also, I am completely uninformed about Bixby in particular, but I have a reluctance and paranoia about 'digital assistants' and their potential for breaching my privacy in a number of ways. So Bixby was a no-go for me right off the bat.

ALSO, I am a boring middle age man stuck in his ways. I've used smartphones since before Android - the old Samsung Windows Mobile phones 10+ years ago. They were horrible, of course. But I've had a way of doing things since Android 3 or so that I just haven't really changed. My stuff is setup as much like my old configs as possible. I don't want shiny new stuff. I want my old stuff, only faster and better. Bixby has no place in that.

All my yapping aside, the S9 and S9+ are absolutely fantastic phones and I'm extremely lucky the Verizon dude recognized me as a football teammate from 25 years ago so I got almost $500 off.

"I used my S9 Plus naked for a month. Absolutely loved the phone. Was a tad bit slipper when I was having my hands slightly wet from transpiration, decided to get a case before the beautiful glass was going to break one day. Was this close to getting the basic Samsung silicone black cover, didn't like the way it looked and the way it felt in the pocket, I then gave both the led cover (big fan in the past) case a view and then the clear view cover, said I wanted something different.

I instantly wanted to get the alcantara one until I remembered it ruins itself once it touches water. I then instantly bought the protective standing cover. Do not regret it one bit even tho it looks a bit weird on the back. The phone altho heavier, is easier to hold in your hand, the button pressing feels really easy compared to the naked phone, the stand is a huge huge plus and the way the back is made, if I have money or papers in my pocket, I don't risk pulling it all out once I grab my phone. The only actual minus is the extra weight, the phone now easily passed the 200g mark and the physical size increased. One think I'm a huge fan of however, is the fact that I know how sensitive OLED panels can be to direct sunlight, this case has big protruding lips over the top and bottom of the phone. I can easily put the phone on my table laying screen side down without an issue and if somebody calls or messages me, the edge lighting lights the table, I can easily tell basic whatsapp messages or facebook messages apart from actual sms texts.

**TL;DR**: I used my S9+ without a case for exactly one month, afterwards I got the protective standing cover case, never going back, it's a bit bulky but I don't care. It's decent, it does it's job well.",2018-07-05 11:48:14
"'The new S Pen will integrate Bluetooth for the first time.

Can be used to control long-range self-timers and music playback while it will also gain complete independence for the Galaxy Note 9 itself.

Opens up the potential for the S Pen to work like a digital pen on other surfaces, a presentation clicker, or even pair with other Samsung devices like wearables, laptops and even the company’s smart TVs. In short, with a little creativity, the sky’s the limit.'

"Software wise, yes. If the phone starts up to this screen, the only thing you can do is flash a new firmware to the phone.

Go and download [Samsung Smart Switch](https://www.samsung.com/us/smart-switch/). In Smart Switch you have an option named ""Emergency Firmware Recovery"" (or something among these words). Its' for such situations.

When you'll click it, it will ask for your phone device number (the one on your phone's screen named ""Product Name"" after the double dots) and for a serial number which is written both on the back of the phone (down in the little text area) and on the box of the phone either under ""S/N"" or Serial Number.

Once you write these values, it will begin downloading a new firmware for the phone (the latest one). You'll eventually be prompted to connect the device to the PC. AFter connecting it, wait for at least 1 minute so that you don't get your phone randomly disconnected by Windows. After the one minute, press continue or start, it will start writing the new firmware to the phone.

After the process ends, the phone will be good as new. It will start normally and you'll have to write in a google account and a Samsung account. You'll be able of using your phone normally afterwards. Hope I helped!",2018-07-06 02:06:30

The pouch will protect it from drops when you are most likely to drop it (putting it in and out of your pocket and similar situations) but lets you use it in its fully naked glory.

I ordered from Amazon since its cheaper.

I use the Neo Hybrid case as my 'day-to-day' case where the phone is always in my pocket.  

I use the Wallet S case when I go traveling since the fold over cover provides a better grip when taking lots of photos (or having strangers take photos with your phone) and the cover also protects the screen when throwing the phone in my backpack going through airport security etc..  However, you could use the Wallet case as a day-to-day case as well.

The other thing I strongly recommend buying for the Samsung S9+, Google Pixel 2XL or any large size phone is a Phone Loop from [https://phoneloops.com/](https://phoneloops.com/).  I use the phone loop with the Neo Hybrid case above.  The reason is the phone loop gives you greater stability and control when using the phone and lowers the chance of dropping the phone.

"This phone is marvelous ~

Simply put, the display is incredible. Watching videos or scrolling through Instagram is very enjoyable and it gets hard to go back to other displays (we get spoiled :p)
The camera is excellent too and if you're not a huge camera savvy, it will suit all your needs just fine and keep you going for a long time.
The audio experience is really great too, plugged in or not. I underestimated having dual speakers as a feature but I end up using Dolby Atmos the most. Seriously, it's just fun to be able to play music in the house with your own phone speaker. Also, the AKG bundled earphones are pretty great too. Headphone jack is a plus.
S9 is surprisingly fast. I've had previous samsung phones and they always felt kind of slow, but this one doesnt lag and even after 4 months it performs the same as it did when I first got it.
Battery isnt its best feature but it comfortably gets me through 1 day and can last to 2 with some conservative usage.
The software isnt as annoying and Android 8.0 adds a bonus too. Just be advised that software updates for Samsung phones always take 5 billion years so just keep that in mind.

Seriously, it's just fun to be able to play music in the house with your own phone speaker. Also, the AKG bundled earphones are pretty great too. Headphone jack is a plus.
S9 is surprisingly fast. I've had previous samsung phones and they always felt kind of slow, but this one doesnt lag and even after 4 months it performs the same as it did when I first got it.
Battery isnt its best feature but it comfortably gets me through 1 day and can last to 2 with some conservative usage.
The software isnt as annoying and Android 8.0 adds a bonus too. Just be advised that software updates for Samsung phones always take 5 billion years so just keep that in mind. 

Seriously, a great phone! Good luck OP and please update us if you get it or not!",2018-07-08 19:50:37

For the A8 2018.  To reach the max speed of the phone for transfer.  Get a usb-c 3.1 gen 1 cable.  The one samsung provides is usb 2.0 spec.  So 330mbps is the max transfer rate you can do with the samsung cable that comes with the phone.  It is piece of junk as a usb cable.  ,2018-07-08 23:16:51

"Ok, I will try to provide some feedback for you. I actually have two pairs of level u headphones. I have the pros and a pair with anc.  I have two pairs because I don't always charge them everyday and when one dies I just swap them out for the other pair and charge the dead ones in my car.  I'm lucky enough to be in a semi construction job where I can wear these all day.  
I listen to music often but audio books are what I listen to the most. So on to the good news.
Work time..yes you will get 8 hrs out of these easily. I can make it a full day with music or books but most time I am starting and stopping often or taking calls..my working partner bought some after trying mine and loves them also. 
Now for the anc. I would say that it is decent. I think the main advantage is that they are ear buds and have a passive ability to block sound as it is so the anc doesn't have to be spectacular. I have been in loud server rooms for a whole day and don't know how I would have lived without the anc. It really helps but if you're looking for Bose quiet comfort level of anc it's not going to happen..those things are crazy good. As far as battery life. It's going to take a hit with anc on..if I had to guess because I haven't run anc all day for a while, I would say about 6 hours maybe a bit more. The good news is that these things charge very fast..you can plug them in for 15-20 min and get 1.5 hrs. 
Sound wise..I think they are good.. decently loud although I don't think any wireless headphones are loud enough. You do have access to Samsungs uhq sound if your using a newer Galaxy and yes it makes quite the difference. The sound is much more crisp.  Bass wise they are good..not crazy bass but I think they are just fine..
Comfort and build..I think they are very comfortable. I know not a lot of people like around the neck stuff but these are just fine..light weight and the build quality is the best out of the two. 
With pricing the way it has dropped lately I don't think you can go wrong with these..I was looking into the new around the neck headphones from Samsung but I don't think they support uhq or any other high def sound so that's a no go for me..
I purchased my standard pros at Sam's club for a good price and ordered the anc from Samsung. At the time they were fairly new so they were still pricy..
I hope this has helped you. I have had these for a while and the last thing I will say is that they are fairly durable. I am a pretty careful person with electronics but even still they are pretty strong.
Good luck .",2018-07-09 00:50:29

This is why you always request local ifixubreak. Samsung will cover costs and you get phone back in a few hours. I believe if ifixubreak not in your country, there's other options similar to it. 

 If you ever do have to ship. Take pics of phone current condition and todays newspaper with date on it. Make sure newspaper is in the background. Bonus with pics next to shipping material. That way you can't get fucked over.

"I had helped my friend switch from an iPhone 7 with Smart Switch and worked very well. It can't move everything (like certain messaging apps) but this works easily. It'll even match up existing apps and ask if you want to install corresponding Android versions. The only annoying part is that during the ""search"" process, the slightest movement of the cable will cancel it. For things that don't come over, check to see if the app has a backup cloud feature.

Most of the big apps are there and corresponding desktop services/apps are also there. Personally, I would look to moving things out of iCloud to allow other apps access to your stored data for the most flexibility. The biggest change could be Google Photos if you're not using it already. Moving files from iCloud to anything else is fairly trivial.

Samsung also has a backup service as well which you can choose to use or not. I think their backup services are decent. Pickup a MicroSD card for external photo storage. It'll free up app space on your phone. Samsung also likes to duplicate apps so you can choose to try others before deciding (like text messaging, contacts, gallery, etc) and then disable/hide the ones you don't want to use.

"True.  When I updated my iPhone, suddenly I had only 25% of my original battery life.  I learned later, that they changed the way the radios were handled in low-power mode, and since I live in a zero-to-1 bar area, my battery life dropped to 2-3 hours (was getting 8-9 hours before, advertised for much, much more) a day before shutdown.  I've noticed this effect with different phones, manufacturers, and oses.

Like others have said, if it's still under warranty, take it in and let the shop have a look at it.

Was it always crap, or did it die gradually (or even suddenly)?

So many things can cause drain.  If you have great battery life in safe mode, then it's an app causing the issue.  If you prove it isn't an app to Samsung, then you can get a free repair, or in extreme cases, a replacement.",2018-07-10 22:28:30

"I'm amazed actually. And at this point I think your batter has an effect where that lower portion you never reach is filled with enough energy to last much longer than it should and what you're expecting.

Without video proof, even the 30 to 90 claim is beyond anything possible, especially with qualcomm quick charging 2.0 or samsung fast charging 1.0. I'm sorry. I've had quite a lot of phones, none from Samsung (even S6 which had a tiny battery) would charge THAT fast. The fastest charging phone I ever owned was this A5 2017.

"TL;DR: Huge explanation bellow about charging these phones. If you aren't in the mood to read, just watch the video linked bellow. It's showing pretty much everything I was saying up. Have a great day!

That's the case with most Samsung phones for a while now. My S9+ also charges quite a significant bit if plugged in the wall for like 15-30 minutes. Only requirement is that I turn off wifi/data when doing so and I get about 40&amp;#37; in 30 minutes. After that it charges slower and when I reach 90&amp;#37; it takes a full 20-30 minutes to hit 100. Which is normal behaviour. It acts this way to preserve the life of the battery.

Now. Pure proof of what I said earlier is, first of all, the fact that battery technology works this way. If you will start using the other 15&amp;#37; percent of the battery til' you hit 0&amp;#37;, you'll realise that the 15&amp;#37; left is lasting longer than as much as 30&amp;#37; of your normal usage. My old S6 once lasted me around 13 minutes on 1&amp;#37;. I wanted to fully drain it and recharge it. And the last 1&amp;#37; lasted more than about 10&amp;#37; did. There are talks about these phenomenons on the internet. Won't bother trying to find them.

My analogy for you (and I'm ending on this note) is the fact that all current Samsung phones that support fast charging, have the same exact componentry for charging. My S9 does not charger any faster or slower than your A8 or my A5 or even J series phones that support fast charging. The power brick delivers 10W in fast charging mode. Maybe my S9 will be 1-2&amp;#37; more efficient in handling that, but not enough for it to be noticeable in the long run. You'll maybe save 30 minutes of charging per year due to that efficiency increase.

[Here's a youtube video from a Hindi youtuber showing that in fact, it takes both the A8 and A8+ a normal amount of time to go from 0&amp;#37; to 100&amp;#37;.](https://youtu.be/KEIGhb6w4qg?t=88)

And judging by the increases seen here, it's physically impossible for your A8 to reach 90&amp;#37; from 30&amp;#37; in just 20-30 minutes, let alone 15-20.

Unless you had your phone repaired and you got a smaller battery placed in your phone (Something like 1500mA), you're either not aware of how long it actually takes to charge (because you're usually doing something else than spending time to check your phone religiously) or you're simply oblivious and pretty much assuming everything rather than basing off actual numbers.

And with that I'm ending my thesis here. I have owned many samsung phones both before fast charging was a thing and after and I have noticed always how long it took to charge a phone. A note 4 for example, does indeed charge slower compared to something like an S7 while an S7 charges barely any slower compared to an S9. Why? The charging technology inside the phone has improved through time quite a bit. We moved most of the charging components into chargers (hence they get so hot when charging a phone), and now the phone simply has to do minimal work. The same charger that shipped with the Galaxy Note 4 (first official fast charging Samsung device) has identical hardware on the inside with any samsung adaptive fast charger sold today. Identical. It can charge both Quick Charge 2.0 devices &amp; Fast Charge 1.0 devices just well.

And simply basing off the fact that the charger itself is identical, I can simply say our phones charge the same, exact same actually efficiency being slightly different from one phone to another but newer gen devices such as the A8 and S9 having virtually the same capability.",2018-07-11 07:48:07

there isn't a feature as such on the S8 as of now since Samsung hasn't updated the messages app for the S8 yet. one workaround is using the voice recorder app to record whatever it is then attaching it using the little paperclip button on the bottom left corner of the messaging screen on the app.,2018-07-15 11:47:41
It could also be the crappy samsung cable.  It might not be bringing enough amps to the phone to charge.  Do you have any good usb c cables that meet usb 3.1 specs.  Not the samsung one that is only usb 2.0.,2018-07-15 12:15:14

I have an app called Zoom (video conferencing app) for work that tried to access my camera and mic on serveral different occasions when there was no meeting nor anyone try to initiate one.

"I already owned the Westones, so that part of the purchase was not needed.

To get customs, you pay an audiologist to make a silicone mold, which isn't expensive.  It feels funny, admittedly :) .

Those molds of your inner and outer ears are sent to the vendor who will craft them into custom fitted IEMS for you.  In many cases, those can be used as plug-in replacements for the generic inner ear molds with an existing IEM - such as the AKG model included with the Samsung.  You might have to specify the IEM model, potentially.

In my case, I used InEarz because they agreed to reuse my Westone hardware (i.e., they literally broke the shells open to get at their components), then create custom IEMs as single units for each ear, made to my specs (i.e., shorter inner ear depth, softer canal material, custom outer shell colours, 2-prong cable attachment type, Westone audio hardware).

I don't know if InEarz is still adapting existing IEMs to custom IEMs or if they only sell their own audio hardware (which includes the custom fit), but here's their process and links to prices, if curious:

https://www.inearz.com/how-to-order/

Their Representative at the time was pretty good at answering my questions before I started the order process.

Various threads at https://www.head-fi.org/ can help to get an idea on custom fitted IEM companies, btw.",2018-07-15 17:50:25

"Note 8 if you're going by those 2.
Hitting the fine points...
Note 8 has a 3300 mah battery, 6 GB of RAM. 6.3"" screen, dual 12 MP camera (8 MP on the front), 64 GB internal storage, 256 GB SD card slot, and the S Pen (which keep in mind isn't for everyone)
S9 has 3000 MAH battery, 4 GB of RAM, 5.8"" screen, single 12 MP camera with that lense that opens and closes (8 on the front), 64 GB internal and a 400 GB SD card slot.
So, unless the size of the phone and the SD card slot are important to you, then there you go.
Now, i actually sell these things on a daily basis, and i opted for the S9+ for my personal phone.

The S9+, IMO, surpasses the note 8 just barely.
It has everything the s9 has, but it separates itself with the 3500 mah battery, 6 GB of RAM and a 6.2"" display and that dual camera on the back which IMO beats the Note 8.

Even if you unroot doesn't matter. Knox is tripped and there's no going back. Also Samsung pay and secure folder won't work. Will have issues with other apps as you already mentioned. I do know you can download netflix apk on offical website and works.

I don’t have that promo going (Att) but all the other stores around ours (Verizon, t mobile, etc.) all have the marked up price of 914.99+tax and are running a 200 off promo (price in the Samsung store) In general buying from Samsung or Best Buy or one of those places can usually be cheaper, and equipment changes are very easy for us as long as your phone is AT&amp;T ready. We charge like 5$ for SIM cards (can coupon on new activations) so that might be the route you want to go. AT&amp;T is charging a 30$ upgrade fee even if you just change SIM cards now though afaik, so beware of that. (Our S9+ is 914.99 too)",2018-07-01 21:42:27
"I worked in a cell phone booth for a little bit during Christmas and I can tell you that Samsung really does cover most of the bases when it comes to price, they have their introductory J series followed by the mid-range A series, and then there S Series and the notes. More than likely if Apple does release a newer phone at a lower price rate it would be replacing the iPhone SE which was essentially an iPhone 6 in an iPhone 5 case. The newest phone in the mid-range series for Samsung is the A8 which essentially was just a refresh of an A5 but with better pieces inside. So I doubt Samsung would come out with another phone for a while seeing that they just did one.",2018-07-01 23:16:05
"Far from the best in every catagory, except for processor but thats just for those tasks but all the other hardware holds it back way to far and the better specs of android make it a much cleaner experience especially if you get a launcher like nova, as for display he must be joking my brother is so pissed at himself for buying the x and his biggest gripe is that while the display is nice it just doesnt compare to the samsung displays god and its not just that

Iphones are decent in all catagories but android is just far superior, you make the phone look like you want and change how it functions entirly (plus you could easily get any app or song for free without breaking warrenty) 

I cant get myself to get any apple products because each one just becomes more and more of a cashgrab with each product, and theu would only really be worth the price and a 40-50% discount

Also apple and innovation dont really gp together, especially not the design up untill rhe 6 and x it was the same peice of crap phone design (not to mention blatently leaving in a bend gate to cut production costs), but the most innovative design was the xaomi mi mix until the, galaxy until the Find X (which might i add was an absolutly perfect way to hid the front facing components",2018-07-02 00:54:52
"I kind of don't get it, probably out of the loop pretty bad, but what were the issues between the two?

I just always assumed it was the OS and maybe a display or two on models since Android models rock different display properties. 

(Last iPhone I had was a 5 and switched back to Android after due to iTunes never working right, everything wanting to sync bothered me as I try to keep my phone a brick as much as possible and hate developers butting in, and lack of home screen customization. There was also a case where I lost all my music, photos, and contacts when my phone did an auto update and over the phone I was snobbly told to back up and that apple products work better together WHEN why is something that is supposed to INSTALL something doing the exact opposite of that by DELETING files... in apps that are apple certified so it's not like a third party mishap. 

Haven't gone back to apple since that one and have had an s5 and 3 s7's after so idk the full details but some of the features now are either niche, lack proper support, or is pushed in models for consumer feedback. Like I highly doubt Samsung would take audio ports out of their phones like Apple tried to do on the 9 or 10 hehe.)",2018-07-02 02:05:52

* download ADB for your particular computers' OS (linked in the above article)
* Enable developer mode on your phone
* Use the above guide and the ADB commands to uninstall the application

"Welcome to the best decision you've made in a while ;)

Seriously though.  I had the first iPhone all the way through (each phone in between) to the iPhone 5.  Had 3 iPads.  And 4 iPods from the original metal spinning hard drive to the later model touch sreens etc.  And I dabbled in iOS developing 3 apps that used to be on the app store (made a few hundred on em).

Then I switched to Galaxy/Android one day after having a few hours to toy around on a friend's

I've now gone from every Galaxy from that point to the Note 3, 4, 5, 7, 7 (lol), and now the 8.

Since then I have switched my parents from iPhones and iPads to Galaxys and Samsung tablets.  My wife too although she was just on an old LG something which was android so she doesn't count haha.

Why am I spouting off about ALL of that?

1) Shows I am not just an android fan boy, I had plenty of exposure to apple garbage.  Honestly I STILL believe apple was better up until around the iPhone 5 when Samsung started flying past them.

2) Shows even the excuse ""But I don't need all that extra shit, I am a simple person and prefer the training wheels style of apple"" is still not true as my parents are old and retired and absolutely love their new Android overlords and are now on their 4th or 5th phones.

3) Despite the Note 7 fuck up, I'm still here and loyal and honestly could not be happier with my current phone, and my past ones (even that Note 7 was bad ass).  Love my wife's new phone.  And we have my son on an LG G6 which is nice too.

P.S. Your favorite thing about Android will be watching Apple commercials when they announce 'new' features and you giggle as we've had that for YEARS now.

P.P.S. If you're looking for those ""must have"" apps I won't go off on an extensive list but Nova Launcher is a must and is worth the money for Pro.

Really? The selling point for me and Samsung is Knox/security. Your contracted repairmen are making customers sign off their data if there's a defect covered under warranty. This is a BIG hole in the security.



Just venting. Tell me what you all think. I'm considering going on Twitter. Samsung called me to follow up on the repair with a survey and the lady claimed she had no idea that was the issue.

"I work in retail selling TVs, computers, cameras, etc. There's MUCH more to what makes a TV other than the screen size and resolution. 

The most basic, other than resolution, would be the panel type. More expensive panels have better colour reproduction, better viewing angles, and tend to be held to a higher quality control standard so tend to last longer. At the highest end of these panels currently available to consumers would be Samsung's QLED, and LG/Sony's OLED. OLED has the advantage of getting perfect blacks as each LED generates it's own light, eliminating the need of a backlight, and allowing OLEDs to be the most colour accurate panels. However, QLED is brighter, so it works better in a brighter room, and it doesn't have the risk of burn-in like OLEDs have.

Then there's what type of backlighting the TV uses. For simplicity I'll keep it to edge lighting, and full array lighting. Edge lighting is cheaper, but you get the drawbacks of worse image and colour quality, and you can notice dropoffs in brightness on certain parts of the screen. Full array lighting has LEDs spread all behind the panel for a more uniform and consistent backlight.

High Dynamic Range (HDR) is a feature that has become more common on TVs in the past few years. [Linus over here can explain it better than I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wthhc1s0Pig). 

Next is 4K upscaling. Almost no cable signal does 4K, unless you have a fiber optic TV box. So to get your standard cable signal filling up the full 4K screen, the TV has to upscale the signal, which basically means it has to generate extra pixels that weren't originally there. Generally, the more expensive the TV, the better the upscaling is. Right now Sony seems to have the best upscaling chips. Of course, you can get 4k content from online sources, or from a 4K Blu-Ray player with 4K disc though.

Other than that, as you pay more, Smart TV functionalities tend to be better and more snappy, speakers get better, etc. 

The main reason I would rather buy a TV from the big guys (Samsung, Sony, LG), rather than the small guys (Hisense, RCA, etc.) is overall quality and support. You will experience MUCH better support from the bigger companies, not only in customer service, but also in setting up third party devices such as universal remotes, etc. The big guys tend to have more authorized service centers also, where as you're pretty much out of luck with the small guys.",2018-07-03 13:58:33

"Thank you for posting this. I traded in my phone in in early February. 4.5 months later, in late June, my credit card was charged. I was told by Samsung that the phone had liquid damage. 

1. It did not. It was in excellent condition. 
2. I carefully went through the Terms and Conditions before sending my phone in, making sure it met each one. Nowhere is liquid or water damage listed in the T&amp;C. 
3. Samsung had the phone for over 4 months before discovering any damage. It sounds like the damage occurred while in Samsung's care, as yours did. 

I initialized a dispute with my credit card company very soon after the charge was made. I have contacted Samsung 7 times via phone and email, and they have been incredibly unhelpful.  The first representative said he couldn't find any evidence of liquid damage, which he thought was odd, nor could he find anything in the T&amp;C about liquid damage. They are still charging me, though. This post encouraged me to contact the BBB, which I have just done. We've been Samsung customers for a long time, but I am now seriously rethinking the purchase of any future products. Thank you OP. ",2018-07-04 12:33:10

"Only had my S9+ for a week. After 2 days Bixby had to go. 90% because button. A damn dedicated physical button in an inconvenient place for a single app/tool that a meaningful portion of owners will never use. Every button is an extra inlet for potential water damage on a phone that's supposed to be pretty strongly water resistant.

Also, I am completely uninformed about Bixby in particular, but I have a reluctance and paranoia about 'digital assistants' and their potential for breaching my privacy in a number of ways. So Bixby was a no-go for me right off the bat.

ALSO, I am a boring middle age man stuck in his ways. I've used smartphones since before Android - the old Samsung Windows Mobile phones 10+ years ago. They were horrible, of course. But I've had a way of doing things since Android 3 or so that I just haven't really changed. My stuff is setup as much like my old configs as possible. I don't want shiny new stuff. I want my old stuff, only faster and better. Bixby has no place in that.

All my yapping aside, the S9 and S9+ are absolutely fantastic phones and I'm extremely lucky the Verizon dude recognized me as a football teammate from 25 years ago so I got almost $500 off.

"I used my S9 Plus naked for a month. Absolutely loved the phone. Was a tad bit slipper when I was having my hands slightly wet from transpiration, decided to get a case before the beautiful glass was going to break one day. Was this close to getting the basic Samsung silicone black cover, didn't like the way it looked and the way it felt in the pocket, I then gave both the led cover (big fan in the past) case a view and then the clear view cover, said I wanted something different.

I instantly wanted to get the alcantara one until I remembered it ruins itself once it touches water. I then instantly bought the protective standing cover. Do not regret it one bit even tho it looks a bit weird on the back. The phone altho heavier, is easier to hold in your hand, the button pressing feels really easy compared to the naked phone, the stand is a huge huge plus and the way the back is made, if I have money or papers in my pocket, I don't risk pulling it all out once I grab my phone. The only actual minus is the extra weight, the phone now easily passed the 200g mark and the physical size increased. One think I'm a huge fan of however, is the fact that I know how sensitive OLED panels can be to direct sunlight, this case has big protruding lips over the top and bottom of the phone. I can easily put the phone on my table laying screen side down without an issue and if somebody calls or messages me, the edge lighting lights the table, I can easily tell basic whatsapp messages or facebook messages apart from actual sms texts.

**TL;DR**: I used my S9+ without a case for exactly one month, afterwards I got the protective standing cover case, never going back, it's a bit bulky but I don't care. It's decent, it does it's job well.",2018-07-05 11:48:14

Then I would do a factory reset after backing up through Samsung smart switch. I would back up everything but apps and settings. Probably quickest way to fix it. You could try an ad scanner app that will tell you what apps are causing notifications to see if anything looks off. ,2018-07-05 15:16:30

I use the Samsung Galaxy S9+without a case but I have a Dbrands skin on the back to make it less slippery. On top of that I am super careful with the device and I have had it since the day it came out. No injuries yet!,2018-07-06 01:52:37
"Software wise, yes. If the phone starts up to this screen, the only thing you can do is flash a new firmware to the phone.

Go and download [Samsung Smart Switch](https://www.samsung.com/us/smart-switch/). In Smart Switch you have an option named ""Emergency Firmware Recovery"" (or something among these words). Its' for such situations.

When you'll click it, it will ask for your phone device number (the one on your phone's screen named ""Product Name"" after the double dots) and for a serial number which is written both on the back of the phone (down in the little text area) and on the box of the phone either under ""S/N"" or Serial Number.

Once you write these values, it will begin downloading a new firmware for the phone (the latest one). You'll eventually be prompted to connect the device to the PC. AFter connecting it, wait for at least 1 minute so that you don't get your phone randomly disconnected by Windows. After the one minute, press continue or start, it will start writing the new firmware to the phone.

After the process ends, the phone will be good as new. It will start normally and you'll have to write in a google account and a Samsung account. You'll be able of using your phone normally afterwards. Hope I helped!",2018-07-06 02:06:30

"Yeah... I personally think that Samsungs phones are the best ones.
It doesn't matter if it has more or less battery, if it's big or small.
The only important thing is that these phones are from Samsung(best comoamy).That's why they are great, other things aren't important.
Summery: if your phone is a Samsung one it's a great phone (probably the best in the century)
But if your phone isn't Samsung, your phone is trash",2018-07-06 10:59:11

"I used to heavily use the Spen. I've been a Note user since the Note 4. Now, I feel apps are even less optimised for it. I find chrome and other applications tend to constantly scroll down. Some applications bug out and freeze when I'm using the SPen. 

My advice, avoid the Note. 

On top of that, Samsung discontinued their incredible note taking app. The new Samsung notes is trash compared to the default app on the Note 4.

Call fedex and see if they will cover damage? I know USPS will cover up to $100 on standard or priority shipping, not sure which. Been a while since I shipped. ",2018-07-06 19:15:33

That I don't know. Call your local samsung and they should have answer. I'd imagine they have local repair shop in your country, they recommend. If so you would get your phone in a few hours. 

Thin case and barely can tell screen protector on.

"Putting a cover on a beautiful piece of tech sort of defeats the point of buying a beautiful piece of tech. Seriously, if you're going to permanently cover the thing then don't worry about its looks. But I accept that these things are fragile. There is a compromise. Put it in a pouch. The pouch will protect it from drops when you are most likely to drop it (putting it in and out of your pocket and similar situations) but lets you use it in its fully naked glory. This has worked for me. I've dropped my S8 a few times butt always in its pouch and no damage was done. But when I actually use it, I get to use it as Samsung intended.",2018-07-07 02:25:14

Spigen Galaxy S9 Plus Case Neo Hybrid (Gunmetal colour)

Spigen Wallet S - Foldable Synthetic Leather with  Kickstand Feature and Card Slot for Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus (2018) -  Black

I ordered from Amazon since its cheaper.

I use the Neo Hybrid case as my 'day-to-day' case where the phone is always in my pocket.  

I use the Wallet S case when I go traveling since the fold over cover provides a better grip when taking lots of photos (or having strangers take photos with your phone) and the cover also protects the screen when throwing the phone in my backpack going through airport security etc..  However, you could use the Wallet case as a day-to-day case as well.

The other thing I strongly recommend buying for the Samsung S9+, Google Pixel 2XL or any large size phone is a Phone Loop from [https://phoneloops.com/](https://phoneloops.com/).  I use the phone loop with the Neo Hybrid case above.  The reason is the phone loop gives you greater stability and control when using the phone and lowers the chance of dropping the phone.

I did manage to bypass this using adb to open the settings app and adding a Google account you own and then doing a factory reset in the settings app I don't remember any of the adb commands mostly just looked stuff up as I go.

"""One hand operation"" (app name) by Samsung is A.M.A.Z.I.N.G
It works flawlessly, it does NOT use accesibility service which is win situation for me, you can get in on apkmirror if you are not from US, UK and Korea (if you are, then it's available on Galaxy apps for you)

* Speakers with DOLBY Atmos are loud and crisp, also with headphones! EQ and custom sound profile are great to have
* Customizable
* Software gets better, homescreen looks modern and also on par with some launchers
* Capable device with RAM management and storage that never runs out (especially with SD Card) 
* Battery is okay, lasts the whole day with battery saver on and stuff like Background Network off and AOD off.

"This phone is marvelous ~

Simply put, the display is incredible. Watching videos or scrolling through Instagram is very enjoyable and it gets hard to go back to other displays (we get spoiled :p)
The camera is excellent too and if you're not a huge camera savvy, it will suit all your needs just fine and keep you going for a long time.
The audio experience is really great too, plugged in or not. I underestimated having dual speakers as a feature but I end up using Dolby Atmos the most. Seriously, it's just fun to be able to play music in the house with your own phone speaker. Also, the AKG bundled earphones are pretty great too. Headphone jack is a plus.
S9 is surprisingly fast. I've had previous samsung phones and they always felt kind of slow, but this one doesnt lag and even after 4 months it performs the same as it did when I first got it.
Battery isnt its best feature but it comfortably gets me through 1 day and can last to 2 with some conservative usage.
The software isnt as annoying and Android 8.0 adds a bonus too. Just be advised that software updates for Samsung phones always take 5 billion years so just keep that in mind.

For the A8 2018.  To reach the max speed of the phone for transfer.  Get a usb-c 3.1 gen 1 cable.  The one samsung provides is usb 2.0 spec.  So 330mbps is the max transfer rate you can do with the samsung cable that comes with the phone.  It is piece of junk as a usb cable.  ,2018-07-08 23:16:51

"Ok, I will try to provide some feedback for you. I actually have two pairs of level u headphones. I have the pros and a pair with anc.  I have two pairs because I don't always charge them everyday and when one dies I just swap them out for the other pair and charge the dead ones in my car.  I'm lucky enough to be in a semi construction job where I can wear these all day.  
I listen to music often but audio books are what I listen to the most. So on to the good news.
Work time..yes you will get 8 hrs out of these easily. I can make it a full day with music or books but most time I am starting and stopping often or taking calls..my working partner bought some after trying mine and loves them also. 
Now for the anc. I would say that it is decent. I think the main advantage is that they are ear buds and have a passive ability to block sound as it is so the anc doesn't have to be spectacular. I have been in loud server rooms for a whole day and don't know how I would have lived without the anc. It really helps but if you're looking for Bose quiet comfort level of anc it's not going to happen..those things are crazy good. As far as battery life. It's going to take a hit with anc on..if I had to guess because I haven't run anc all day for a while, I would say about 6 hours maybe a bit more. The good news is that these things charge very fast..you can plug them in for 15-20 min and get 1.5 hrs. 
Sound wise..I think they are good.. decently loud although I don't think any wireless headphones are loud enough. You do have access to Samsungs uhq sound if your using a newer Galaxy and yes it makes quite the difference. The sound is much more crisp.  Bass wise they are good..not crazy bass but I think they are just fine..
Comfort and build..I think they are very comfortable. I know not a lot of people like around the neck stuff but these are just fine..light weight and the build quality is the best out of the two. 
With pricing the way it has dropped lately I don't think you can go wrong with these..I was looking into the new around the neck headphones from Samsung but I don't think they support uhq or any other high def sound so that's a no go for me..
I purchased my standard pros at Sam's club for a good price and ordered the anc from Samsung. At the time they were fairly new so they were still pricy..
I hope this has helped you. I have had these for a while and the last thing I will say is that they are fairly durable. I am a pretty careful person with electronics but even still they are pretty strong.
Good luck .",2018-07-09 00:50:29

This is why you always request local ifixubreak. Samsung will cover costs and you get phone back in a few hours. I believe if ifixubreak not in your country, there's other options similar to it. 

 If you ever do have to ship. Take pics of phone current condition and todays newspaper with date on it. Make sure newspaper is in the background. Bonus with pics next to shipping material. That way you can't get fucked over.

"I had helped my friend switch from an iPhone 7 with Smart Switch and worked very well. It can't move everything (like certain messaging apps) but this works easily. It'll even match up existing apps and ask if you want to install corresponding Android versions. The only annoying part is that during the ""search"" process, the slightest movement of the cable will cancel it. For things that don't come over, check to see if the app has a backup cloud feature.

Most of the big apps are there and corresponding desktop services/apps are also there. Personally, I would look to moving things out of iCloud to allow other apps access to your stored data for the most flexibility. The biggest change could be Google Photos if you're not using it already. Moving files from iCloud to anything else is fairly trivial.

Samsung also has a backup service as well which you can choose to use or not. I think their backup services are decent. Pickup a MicroSD card for external photo storage. It'll free up app space on your phone. Samsung also likes to duplicate apps so you can choose to try others before deciding (like text messaging, contacts, gallery, etc) and then disable/hide the ones you don't want to use. This will probably most confusing part for a new user.",2018-07-10 12:46:45

"True.  When I updated my iPhone, suddenly I had only 25% of my original battery life.  I learned later, that they changed the way the radios were handled in low-power mode, and since I live in a zero-to-1 bar area, my battery life dropped to 2-3 hours (was getting 8-9 hours before, advertised for much, much more) a day before shutdown.  I've noticed this effect with different phones, manufacturers, and oses.

Like others have said, if it's still under warranty, take it in and let the shop have a look at it.

Was it always crap, or did it die gradually (or even suddenly)?

So many things can cause drain.  If you have great battery life in safe mode, then it's an app causing the issue.  If you prove it isn't an app to Samsung, then you can get a free repair, or in extreme cases, a replacement.",2018-07-10 22:28:30

Without video proof, even the 30 to 90 claim is beyond anything possible, especially with qualcomm quick charging 2.0 or samsung fast charging 1.0. I'm sorry. I've had quite a lot of phones, none from Samsung (even S6 which had a tiny battery) would charge THAT fast. The fastest charging phone I ever owned was this A5 2017.

"TL;DR: Huge explanation bellow about charging these phones. If you aren't in the mood to read, just watch the video linked bellow. It's showing pretty much everything I was saying up. Have a great day!

That's the case with most Samsung phones for a while now. My S9+ also charges quite a significant bit if plugged in the wall for like 15-30 minutes. Only requirement is that I turn off wifi/data when doing so and I get about 40&amp;#37; in 30 minutes. After that it charges slower and when I reach 90&amp;#37; it takes a full 20-30 minutes to hit 100. Which is normal behaviour. It acts this way to preserve the life of the battery.

Now. Pure proof of what I said earlier is, first of all, the fact that battery technology works this way. If you will start using the other 15&amp;#37; percent of the battery til' you hit 0&amp;#37;, you'll realise that the 15&amp;#37; left is lasting longer than as much as 30&amp;#37; of your normal usage. My old S6 once lasted me around 13 minutes on 1&amp;#37;. I wanted to fully drain it and recharge it. And the last 1&amp;#37; lasted more than about 10&amp;#37; did. There are talks about these phenomenons on the internet. Won't bother trying to find them.

My analogy for you (and I'm ending on this note) is the fact that all current Samsung phones that support fast charging, have the same exact componentry for charging. My S9 does not charger any faster or slower than your A8 or my A5 or even J series phones that support fast charging. The power brick delivers 10W in fast charging mode. Maybe my S9 will be 1-2&amp;#37; more efficient in handling that, but not enough for it to be noticeable in the long run. You'll maybe save 30 minutes of charging per year due to that efficiency increase.

[Here's a youtube video from a Hindi youtuber showing that in fact, it takes both the A8 and A8+ a normal amount of time to go from 0&amp;#37; to 100&amp;#37;.](https://youtu.be/KEIGhb6w4qg?t=88)

And judging by the increases seen here, it's physically impossible for your A8 to reach 90&amp;#37; from 30&amp;#37; in just 20-30 minutes, let alone 15-20.

Unless you had your phone repaired and you got a smaller battery placed in your phone (Something like 1500mA), you're either not aware of how long it actually takes to charge (because you're usually doing something else than spending time to check your phone religiously) or you're simply oblivious and pretty much assuming everything rather than basing off actual numbers.

And with that I'm ending my thesis here. I have owned many samsung phones both before fast charging was a thing and after and I have noticed always how long it took to charge a phone. A note 4 for example, does indeed charge slower compared to something like an S7 while an S7 charges barely any slower compared to an S9. Why? The charging technology inside the phone has improved through time quite a bit. We moved most of the charging components into chargers (hence they get so hot when charging a phone), and now the phone simply has to do minimal work. The same charger that shipped with the Galaxy Note 4 (first official fast charging Samsung device) has identical hardware on the inside with any samsung adaptive fast charger sold today. Identical. It can charge both Quick Charge 2.0 devices &amp; Fast Charge 1.0 devices just well.

And simply basing off the fact that the charger itself is identical, I can simply say our phones charge the same, exact same actually efficiency being slightly different from one phone to another but newer gen devices such as the A8 and S9 having virtually the same capability.",2018-07-11 07:48:07

"Samsung's Good Lock is not available from the play store. It is available from the ""galaxy apps"" app, which comes pre-installed. You may have to get back to the original samsung app drawer to launch it. The app drawer goes with the launcher..so you may have to get to the original samsung launcher. I do that using twisted home launcher from play store to temporarily switch launcher. If you don't want to mess with all that, I think you might also be able to create a shortcut on nova using the activities shortcut. ",2018-07-11 12:56:09

Seems like it does do something similar to what Blackberry does. I have an app called Zoom (video conferencing app) for work that tried to access my camera and mic on serveral different occasions when there was no meeting nor anyone try to initiate one. I've since revoked all permissions for the app until my next meeting. Kudos to Samsung and Knox ,2018-07-15 14:16:49

"I already owned the Westones, so that part of the purchase was not needed.

To get customs, you pay an audiologist to make a silicone mold, which isn't expensive.  It feels funny, admittedly :) .

Those molds of your inner and outer ears are sent to the vendor who will craft them into custom fitted IEMS for you.  In many cases, those can be used as plug-in replacements for the generic inner ear molds with an existing IEM - such as the AKG model included with the Samsung.  You might have to specify the IEM model, potentially.

In my case, I used InEarz because they agreed to reuse my Westone hardware (i.e., they literally broke the shells open to get at their components), then create custom IEMs as single units for each ear, made to my specs (i.e., shorter inner ear depth, softer canal material, custom outer shell colours, 2-prong cable attachment type, Westone audio hardware).

I don't know if InEarz is still adapting existing IEMs to custom IEMs or if they only sell their own audio hardware (which includes the custom fit), but here's their process and links to prices, if curious:

https://www.inearz.com/how-to-order/

Their Representative at the time was pretty good at answering my questions before I started the order process.

Various threads at https://www.head-fi.org/ can help to get an idea on custom fitted IEM companies, btw.",2018-07-15 17:50:25

"Note 8 if you're going by those 2.
Hitting the fine points...
Note 8 has a 3300 mah battery, 6 GB of RAM. 6.3"" screen, dual 12 MP camera (8 MP on the front), 64 GB internal storage, 256 GB SD card slot, and the S Pen (which keep in mind isn't for everyone)
S9 has 3000 MAH battery, 4 GB of RAM, 5.8"" screen, single 12 MP camera with that lense that opens and closes (8 on the front), 64 GB internal and a 400 GB SD card slot.
So, unless the size of the phone and the SD card slot are important to you, then there you go.
Now, i actually sell these things on a daily basis, and i opted for the S9+ for my personal phone.

The S9+, IMO, surpasses the note 8 just barely.
It has everything the s9 has, but it separates itself with the 3500 mah battery, 6 GB of RAM and a 6.2"" display and that dual camera on the back which IMO beats the Note 8.

Keep in mind there are other things i left out. I just hit the hard hitting points. If you're really on the fence, wait a month. The Samsung announcement for the note 9 is next month.",2018-07-17 05:14:46

Even if you unroot doesn't matter. Knox is tripped and there's no going back. Also Samsung pay and secure folder won't work. Will have issues with other apps as you already mentioned. I do know you can download netflix apk on offical website and works.

I don’t have that promo going (Att) but all the other stores around ours (Verizon, t mobile, etc.) all have the marked up price of 914.99+tax and are running a 200 off promo (price in the Samsung store) In general buying from Samsung or Best Buy or one of those places can usually be cheaper, and equipment changes are very easy for us as long as your phone is AT&amp;T ready. We charge like 5$ for SIM cards (can coupon on new activations) so that might be the route you want to go.

"I worked in a cell phone booth for a little bit during Christmas and I can tell you that Samsung really does cover most of the bases when it comes to price, they have their introductory J series followed by the mid-range A series, and then there S Series and the notes. More than likely if Apple does release a newer phone at a lower price rate it would be replacing the iPhone SE which was essentially an iPhone 6 in an iPhone 5 case. The newest phone in the mid-range series for Samsung is the A8 which essentially was just a refresh of an A5 but with better pieces inside.

"Far from the best in every catagory, except for processor but thats just for those tasks but all the other hardware holds it back way to far and the better specs of android make it a much cleaner experience especially if you get a launcher like nova, as for display he must be joking my brother is so pissed at himself for buying the x and his biggest gripe is that while the display is nice it just doesnt compare to the samsung displays god and its not just that

Iphones are decent in all catagories but android is just far superior, you make the phone look like you want and change how it functions entirly (plus you could easily get any app or song for free without breaking warrenty) 

I cant get myself to get any apple products because each one just becomes more and more of a cashgrab with each product, and theu would only really be worth the price and a 40-50% discount

Also apple and innovation dont really gp together, especially not the design up untill rhe 6 and x it was the same peice of crap phone design (not to mention blatently leaving in a bend gate to cut production costs), but the most innovative design was the xaomi mi mix until the, galaxy until the Find X (which might i add was an absolutly perfect way to hid the front facing components",2018-07-02 00:54:52
"I kind of don't get it, probably out of the loop pretty bad, but what were the issues between the two?

I just always assumed it was the OS and maybe a display or two on models since Android models rock different display properties. 

(Last iPhone I had was a 5 and switched back to Android after due to iTunes never working right, everything wanting to sync bothered me as I try to keep my phone a brick as much as possible and hate developers butting in, and lack of home screen customization. There was also a case where I lost all my music, photos, and contacts when my phone did an auto update and over the phone I was snobbly told to back up and that apple products work better together WHEN why is something that is supposed to INSTALL something doing the exact opposite of that by DELETING files... in apps that are apple certified so it's not like a third party mishap. 

Haven't gone back to apple since that one and have had an s5 and 3 s7's after so idk the full details but some of the features now are either niche, lack proper support, or is pushed in models for consumer feedback. Like I highly doubt Samsung would take audio ports out of their phones like Apple tried to do on the 9 or 10 hehe.)",2018-07-02 02:05:52

* download ADB for your particular computers' OS (linked in the above article)
* Enable developer mode on your phone
* Use the above guide and the ADB commands to uninstall the application

"Welcome to the best decision you've made in a while ;)

Seriously though.  I had the first iPhone all the way through (each phone in between) to the iPhone 5.  Had 3 iPads.  And 4 iPods from the original metal spinning hard drive to the later model touch sreens etc.  And I dabbled in iOS developing 3 apps that used to be on the app store (made a few hundred on em).

Then I switched to Galaxy/Android one day after having a few hours to toy around on a friend's

I've now gone from every Galaxy from that point to the Note 3, 4, 5, 7, 7 (lol), and now the 8.

Since then I have switched my parents from iPhones and iPads to Galaxys and Samsung tablets.  My wife too although she was just on an old LG something which was android so she doesn't count haha.

Why am I spouting off about ALL of that?

1) Shows I am not just an android fan boy, I had plenty of exposure to apple garbage.  Honestly I STILL believe apple was better up until around the iPhone 5 when Samsung started flying past them.

2) Shows even the excuse ""But I don't need all that extra shit, I am a simple person and prefer the training wheels style of apple"" is still not true as my parents are old and retired and absolutely love their new Android overlords and are now on their 4th or 5th phones.

3) Despite the Note 7 fuck up, I'm still here and loyal and honestly could not be happier with my current phone, and my past ones (even that Note 7 was bad ass).  Love my wife's new phone.  And we have my son on an LG G6 which is nice too.

P.S. Your favorite thing about Android will be watching Apple commercials when they announce 'new' features and you giggle as we've had that for YEARS now.

P.P.S. If you're looking for those ""must have"" apps I won't go off on an extensive list but Nova Launcher is a must and is worth the money for Pro.

Really? The selling point for me and Samsung is Knox/security. Your contracted repairmen are making customers sign off their data if there's a defect covered under warranty. This is a BIG hole in the security.



Just venting. Tell me what you all think. I'm considering going on Twitter. Samsung called me to follow up on the repair with a survey and the lady claimed she had no idea that was the issue.

"I work in retail selling TVs, computers, cameras, etc. There's MUCH more to what makes a TV other than the screen size and resolution. 

The most basic, other than resolution, would be the panel type. More expensive panels have better colour reproduction, better viewing angles, and tend to be held to a higher quality control standard so tend to last longer. At the highest end of these panels currently available to consumers would be Samsung's QLED, and LG/Sony's OLED. OLED has the advantage of getting perfect blacks as each LED generates it's own light, eliminating the need of a backlight, and allowing OLEDs to be the most colour accurate panels. However, QLED is brighter, so it works better in a brighter room, and it doesn't have the risk of burn-in like OLEDs have.

Then there's what type of backlighting the TV uses. For simplicity I'll keep it to edge lighting, and full array lighting. Edge lighting is cheaper, but you get the drawbacks of worse image and colour quality, and you can notice dropoffs in brightness on certain parts of the screen. Full array lighting has LEDs spread all behind the panel for a more uniform and consistent backlight.

High Dynamic Range (HDR) is a feature that has become more common on TVs in the past few years. [Linus over here can explain it better than I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wthhc1s0Pig). 

Next is 4K upscaling. Almost no cable signal does 4K, unless you have a fiber optic TV box. So to get your standard cable signal filling up the full 4K screen, the TV has to upscale the signal, which basically means it has to generate extra pixels that weren't originally there. Generally, the more expensive the TV, the better the upscaling is. Right now Sony seems to have the best upscaling chips. Of course, you can get 4k content from online sources, or from a 4K Blu-Ray player with 4K disc though.

Other than that, as you pay more, Smart TV functionalities tend to be better and more snappy, speakers get better, etc. 

The main reason I would rather buy a TV from the big guys (Samsung, Sony, LG), rather than the small guys (Hisense, RCA, etc.) is overall quality and support. You will experience MUCH better support from the bigger companies, not only in customer service, but also in setting up third party devices such as universal remotes, etc. The big guys tend to have more authorized service centers also, where as you're pretty much out of luck with the small guys.",2018-07-03 13:58:33

"Thank you for posting this. I traded in my phone in in early February. 4.5 months later, in late June, my credit card was charged. I was told by Samsung that the phone had liquid damage. 

1. It did not. It was in excellent condition. 
2. I carefully went through the Terms and Conditions before sending my phone in, making sure it met each one. Nowhere is liquid or water damage listed in the T&amp;C. 
3. Samsung had the phone for over 4 months before discovering any damage. It sounds like the damage occurred while in Samsung's care, as yours did. 

I initialized a dispute with my credit card company very soon after the charge was made. I have contacted Samsung 7 times via phone and email, and they have been incredibly unhelpful.  The first representative said he couldn't find any evidence of liquid damage, which he thought was odd, nor could he find anything in the T&amp;C about liquid damage. They are still charging me, though. This post encouraged me to contact the BBB, which I have just done. We've been Samsung customers for a long time, but I am now seriously rethinking the purchase of any future products. Thank you OP. ",2018-07-04 12:33:10

"Only had my S9+ for a week. After 2 days Bixby had to go. 90% because button. A damn dedicated physical button in an inconvenient place for a single app/tool that a meaningful portion of owners will never use. Every button is an extra inlet for potential water damage on a phone that's supposed to be pretty strongly water resistant.

Also, I am completely uninformed about Bixby in particular, but I have a reluctance and paranoia about 'digital assistants' and their potential for breaching my privacy in a number of ways. So Bixby was a no-go for me right off the bat.

ALSO, I am a boring middle age man stuck in his ways. I've used smartphones since before Android - the old Samsung Windows Mobile phones 10+ years ago. They were horrible, of course. But I've had a way of doing things since Android 3 or so that I just haven't really changed. My stuff is setup as much like my old configs as possible. I don't want shiny new stuff. I want my old stuff, only faster and better. Bixby has no place in that.

All my yapping aside, the S9 and S9+ are absolutely fantastic phones and I'm extremely lucky the Verizon dude recognized me as a football teammate from 25 years ago so I got almost $500 off.

"I used my S9 Plus naked for a month. Absolutely loved the phone. Was a tad bit slipper when I was having my hands slightly wet from transpiration, decided to get a case before the beautiful glass was going to break one day. Was this close to getting the basic Samsung silicone black cover, didn't like the way it looked and the way it felt in the pocket, I then gave both the led cover (big fan in the past) case a view and then the clear view cover, said I wanted something different.

I instantly wanted to get the alcantara one until I remembered it ruins itself once it touches water. I then instantly bought the protective standing cover. Do not regret it one bit even tho it looks a bit weird on the back. The phone altho heavier, is easier to hold in your hand, the button pressing feels really easy compared to the naked phone, the stand is a huge huge plus and the way the back is made, if I have money or papers in my pocket, I don't risk pulling it all out once I grab my phone. The only actual minus is the extra weight, the phone now easily passed the 200g mark and the physical size increased. One think I'm a huge fan of however, is the fact that I know how sensitive OLED panels can be to direct sunlight, this case has big protruding lips over the top and bottom of the phone. I can easily put the phone on my table laying screen side down without an issue and if somebody calls or messages me, the edge lighting lights the table, I can easily tell basic whatsapp messages or facebook messages apart from actual sms texts.

**TL;DR**: I used my S9+ without a case for exactly one month, afterwards I got the protective standing cover case, never going back, it's a bit bulky but I don't care. It's decent, it does it's job well.",2018-07-05 11:48:14

I use the Samsung Galaxy S9+without a case but I have a Dbrands skin on the back to make it less slippery. On top of that I am super careful with the device and I have had it since the day it came out. No injuries yet!,2018-07-06 01:52:37
"Software wise, yes. If the phone starts up to this screen, the only thing you can do is flash a new firmware to the phone.

Go and download [Samsung Smart Switch](https://www.samsung.com/us/smart-switch/). In Smart Switch you have an option named ""Emergency Firmware Recovery"" (or something among these words). Its' for such situations.

When you'll click it, it will ask for your phone device number (the one on your phone's screen named ""Product Name"" after the double dots) and for a serial number which is written both on the back of the phone (down in the little text area) and on the box of the phone either under ""S/N"" or Serial Number.

Once you write these values, it will begin downloading a new firmware for the phone (the latest one). You'll eventually be prompted to connect the device to the PC. AFter connecting it, wait for at least 1 minute so that you don't get your phone randomly disconnected by Windows. After the one minute, press continue or start, it will start writing the new firmware to the phone.

After the process ends, the phone will be good as new. It will start normally and you'll have to write in a google account and a Samsung account. You'll be able of using your phone normally afterwards. Hope I helped!",2018-07-06 02:06:30

It doesn't matter if it has more or less battery, if it's big or small.
The only important thing is that these phones are from Samsung(best comoamy).That's why they are great, other things aren't important.

"Putting a cover on a beautiful piece of tech sort of defeats the point of buying a beautiful piece of tech. Seriously, if you're going to permanently cover the thing then don't worry about its looks. But I accept that these things are fragile. There is a compromise. Put it in a pouch. The pouch will protect it from drops when you are most likely to drop it (putting it in and out of your pocket and similar situations) but lets you use it in its fully naked glory. This has worked for me. I've dropped my S8 a few times butt always in its pouch and no damage was done. But when I actually use it, I get to use it as Samsung intended.",2018-07-07 02:25:14

Spigen Galaxy S9 Plus Case Neo Hybrid (Gunmetal colour)

I ordered from Amazon since its cheaper.

I use the Neo Hybrid case as my 'day-to-day' case where the phone is always in my pocket.  

I use the Wallet S case when I go traveling since the fold over cover provides a better grip when taking lots of photos (or having strangers take photos with your phone) and the cover also protects the screen when throwing the phone in my backpack going through airport security etc..  However, you could use the Wallet case as a day-to-day case as well.

The other thing I strongly recommend buying for the Samsung S9+, Google Pixel 2XL or any large size phone is a Phone Loop from [https://phoneloops.com/](https://phoneloops.com/).  I use the phone loop with the Neo Hybrid case above.  The reason is the phone loop gives you greater stability and control when using the phone and lowers the chance of dropping the phone.

"This phone is marvelous ~

Simply put, the display is incredible. Watching videos or scrolling through Instagram is very enjoyable and it gets hard to go back to other displays (we get spoiled :p)
The camera is excellent too and if you're not a huge camera savvy, it will suit all your needs just fine and keep you going for a long time.
The audio experience is really great too, plugged in or not. I underestimated having dual speakers as a feature but I end up using Dolby Atmos the most. Seriously, it's just fun to be able to play music in the house with your own phone speaker. Also, the AKG bundled earphones are pretty great too. Headphone jack is a plus.
S9 is surprisingly fast. I've had previous samsung phones and they always felt kind of slow, but this one doesnt lag and even after 4 months it performs the same as it did when I first got it.
Battery isnt its best feature but it comfortably gets me through 1 day and can last to 2 with some conservative usage.
The software isnt as annoying and Android 8.0 adds a bonus too. Just be advised that software updates for Samsung phones always take 5 billion years so just keep that in mind.

I have two pairs because I don't always charge them everyday and when one dies I just swap them out for the other pair and charge the dead ones in my car.  I'm lucky enough to be in a semi construction job where I can wear these all day.  
I listen to music often but audio books are what I listen to the most. So on to the good news.
Work time..yes you will get 8 hrs out of these easily. I can make it a full day with music or books but most time I am starting and stopping often or taking calls..my working partner bought some after trying mine and loves them also. 
Now for the anc. I would say that it is decent. I think the main advantage is that they are ear buds and have a passive ability to block sound as it is so the anc doesn't have to be spectacular. I have been in loud server rooms for a whole day and don't know how I would have lived without the anc. It really helps but if you're looking for Bose quiet comfort level of anc it's not going to happen..those things are crazy good. As far as battery life. It's going to take a hit with anc on..if I had to guess because I haven't run anc all day for a while, I would say about 6 hours maybe a bit more. The good news is that these things charge very fast..you can plug them in for 15-20 min and get 1.5 hrs. 
Sound wise..I think they are good.. decently loud although I don't think any wireless headphones are loud enough. You do have access to Samsungs uhq sound if your using a newer Galaxy and yes it makes quite the difference. The sound is much more crisp.  Bass wise they are good..not crazy bass but I think they are just fine..
Comfort and build..I think they are very comfortable. I know not a lot of people like around the neck stuff but these are just fine..light weight and the build quality is the best out of the two. 
With pricing the way it has dropped lately I don't think you can go wrong with these..I was looking into the new around the neck headphones from Samsung but I don't think they support uhq or any other high def sound so that's a no go for me..
I purchased my standard pros at Sam's club for a good price and ordered the anc from Samsung. At the time they were fairly new so they were still pricy..
I hope this has helped you. I have had these for a while and the last thing I will say is that they are fairly durable. I am a pretty careful person with electronics but even still they are pretty strong.
Good luck .",2018-07-09 00:50:29

This is why you always request local ifixubreak. Samsung will cover costs and you get phone back in a few hours. I believe if ifixubreak not in your country, there's other options similar to it. 

 If you ever do have to ship. Take pics of phone current condition and todays newspaper with date on it. Make sure newspaper is in the background. Bonus with pics next to shipping material. That way you can't get fucked over.

"I had helped my friend switch from an iPhone 7 with Smart Switch and worked very well. It can't move everything (like certain messaging apps) but this works easily. It'll even match up existing apps and ask if you want to install corresponding Android versions. The only annoying part is that during the ""search"" process, the slightest movement of the cable will cancel it. For things that don't come over, check to see if the app has a backup cloud feature.

Most of the big apps are there and corresponding desktop services/apps are also there. Personally, I would look to moving things out of iCloud to allow other apps access to your stored data for the most flexibility. The biggest change could be Google Photos if you're not using it already. Moving files from iCloud to anything else is fairly trivial.

Samsung also has a backup service as well which you can choose to use or not. I think their backup services are decent. Pickup a MicroSD card for external photo storage. It'll free up app space on your phone. Samsung also likes to duplicate apps so you can choose to try others before deciding (like text messaging, contacts, gallery, etc) and then disable/hide the ones you don't want to use.

"True.  When I updated my iPhone, suddenly I had only 25% of my original battery life.  I learned later, that they changed the way the radios were handled in low-power mode, and since I live in a zero-to-1 bar area, my battery life dropped to 2-3 hours (was getting 8-9 hours before, advertised for much, much more) a day before shutdown.  I've noticed this effect with different phones, manufacturers, and oses.

Like others have said, if it's still under warranty, take it in and let the shop have a look at it.

Was it always crap, or did it die gradually (or even suddenly)?

So many things can cause drain.  If you have great battery life in safe mode, then it's an app causing the issue.  If you prove it isn't an app to Samsung, then you can get a free repair, or in extreme cases, a replacement.",2018-07-10 22:28:30

Without video proof, even the 30 to 90 claim is beyond anything possible, especially with qualcomm quick charging 2.0 or samsung fast charging 1.0. I'm sorry. I've had quite a lot of phones, none from Samsung (even S6 which had a tiny battery) would charge THAT fast. The fastest charging phone I ever owned was this A5 2017.

"TL;DR: Huge explanation bellow about charging these phones. If you aren't in the mood to read, just watch the video linked bellow. It's showing pretty much everything I was saying up. Have a great day!

That's the case with most Samsung phones for a while now. My S9+ also charges quite a significant bit if plugged in the wall for like 15-30 minutes. Only requirement is that I turn off wifi/data when doing so and I get about 40&amp;#37; in 30 minutes. After that it charges slower and when I reach 90&amp;#37; it takes a full 20-30 minutes to hit 100. Which is normal behaviour. It acts this way to preserve the life of the battery.

Now. Pure proof of what I said earlier is, first of all, the fact that battery technology works this way. If you will start using the other 15&amp;#37; percent of the battery til' you hit 0&amp;#37;, you'll realise that the 15&amp;#37; left is lasting longer than as much as 30&amp;#37; of your normal usage. My old S6 once lasted me around 13 minutes on 1&amp;#37;. I wanted to fully drain it and recharge it. And the last 1&amp;#37; lasted more than about 10&amp;#37; did. There are talks about these phenomenons on the internet. Won't bother trying to find them.

My analogy for you (and I'm ending on this note) is the fact that all current Samsung phones that support fast charging, have the same exact componentry for charging. My S9 does not charger any faster or slower than your A8 or my A5 or even J series phones that support fast charging. The power brick delivers 10W in fast charging mode. Maybe my S9 will be 1-2&amp;#37; more efficient in handling that, but not enough for it to be noticeable in the long run. You'll maybe save 30 minutes of charging per year due to that efficiency increase.

[Here's a youtube video from a Hindi youtuber showing that in fact, it takes both the A8 and A8+ a normal amount of time to go from 0&amp;#37; to 100&amp;#37;.](https://youtu.be/KEIGhb6w4qg?t=88)

And judging by the increases seen here, it's physically impossible for your A8 to reach 90&amp;#37; from 30&amp;#37; in just 20-30 minutes, let alone 15-20.

Unless you had your phone repaired and you got a smaller battery placed in your phone (Something like 1500mA), you're either not aware of how long it actually takes to charge (because you're usually doing something else than spending time to check your phone religiously) or you're simply oblivious and pretty much assuming everything rather than basing off actual numbers.

And with that I'm ending my thesis here. I have owned many samsung phones both before fast charging was a thing and after and I have noticed always how long it took to charge a phone. A note 4 for example, does indeed charge slower compared to something like an S7 while an S7 charges barely any slower compared to an S9. Why? The charging technology inside the phone has improved through time quite a bit. We moved most of the charging components into chargers (hence they get so hot when charging a phone), and now the phone simply has to do minimal work. The same charger that shipped with the Galaxy Note 4 (first official fast charging Samsung device) has identical hardware on the inside with any samsung adaptive fast charger sold today. Identical. It can charge both Quick Charge 2.0 devices &amp; Fast Charge 1.0 devices just well.

And simply basing off the fact that the charger itself is identical, I can simply say our phones charge the same, exact same actually efficiency being slightly different from one phone to another but newer gen devices such as the A8 and S9 having virtually the same capability.",2018-07-11 07:48:07

"I already owned the Westones, so that part of the purchase was not needed.

To get customs, you pay an audiologist to make a silicone mold, which isn't expensive.  It feels funny, admittedly :) .

Those molds of your inner and outer ears are sent to the vendor who will craft them into custom fitted IEMS for you.  In many cases, those can be used as plug-in replacements for the generic inner ear molds with an existing IEM - such as the AKG model included with the Samsung.  You might have to specify the IEM model, potentially.

In my case, I used InEarz because they agreed to reuse my Westone hardware (i.e., they literally broke the shells open to get at their components), then create custom IEMs as single units for each ear, made to my specs (i.e., shorter inner ear depth, softer canal material, custom outer shell colours, 2-prong cable attachment type, Westone audio hardware).

I don't know if InEarz is still adapting existing IEMs to custom IEMs or if they only sell their own audio hardware (which includes the custom fit), but here's their process and links to prices, if curious:

https://www.inearz.com/how-to-order/

Their Representative at the time was pretty good at answering my questions before I started the order process.

Various threads at https://www.head-fi.org/ can help to get an idea on custom fitted IEM companies, btw.",2018-07-15 17:50:25

"Note 8 if you're going by those 2.
Hitting the fine points...
Note 8 has a 3300 mah battery, 6 GB of RAM. 6.3"" screen, dual 12 MP camera (8 MP on the front), 64 GB internal storage, 256 GB SD card slot, and the S Pen (which keep in mind isn't for everyone)
S9 has 3000 MAH battery, 4 GB of RAM, 5.8"" screen, single 12 MP camera with that lense that opens and closes (8 on the front), 64 GB internal and a 400 GB SD card slot.
So, unless the size of the phone and the SD card slot are important to you, then there you go.
Now, i actually sell these things on a daily basis, and i opted for the S9+ for my personal phone.

The S9+, IMO, surpasses the note 8 just barely.
It has everything the s9 has, but it separates itself with the 3500 mah battery, 6 GB of RAM and a 6.2"" display and that dual camera on the back which IMO beats the Note 8.

Keep in mind there are other things i left out. I just hit the hard hitting points. If you're really on the fence, wait a month. The Samsung announcement for the note 9 is next month.",2018-07-17 05:14:46

"Ahh shit. Well I'd try take that back asap. You should talk to manager at store and explain situation. If what you're saying is true, then they should take back hopefully? Because if something happens to your phone again, warranty won't cover it. Root= Voided. 

Even if you unroot doesn't matter. Knox is tripped and there's no going back. Also Samsung pay and secure folder won't work. Will have issues with other apps as you already mentioned. I do know you can download netflix apk on offical website and works. 

Just to be sure go on play store and download root checker app.

"I get what you’re saying. I don’t have that promo going (Att) but all the other stores around ours (Verizon, t mobile, etc.) all have the marked up price of 914.99+tax and are running a 200 off promo (price in the Samsung store) In general buying from Samsung or Best Buy or one of those places can usually be cheaper, and equipment changes are very easy for us as long as your phone is AT&amp;T ready. We charge like 5$ for SIM cards (can coupon on new activations) so that might be the route you want to go. AT&amp;T is charging a 30$ upgrade fee even if you just change SIM cards now though afaik, so beware of that. (Our S9+ is 914.99 too)",2018-07-01 21:42:27
"I worked in a cell phone booth for a little bit during Christmas and I can tell you that Samsung really does cover most of the bases when it comes to price, they have their introductory J series followed by the mid-range A series, and then there S Series and the notes. More than likely if Apple does release a newer phone at a lower price rate it would be replacing the iPhone SE which was essentially an iPhone 6 in an iPhone 5 case. The newest phone in the mid-range series for Samsung is the A8 which essentially was just a refresh of an A5 but with better pieces inside. So I doubt Samsung would come out with another phone for a while seeing that they just did one.",2018-07-01 23:16:05
"Far from the best in every catagory, except for processor but thats just for those tasks but all the other hardware holds it back way to far and the better specs of android make it a much cleaner experience especially if you get a launcher like nova, as for display he must be joking my brother is so pissed at himself for buying the x and his biggest gripe is that while the display is nice it just doesnt compare to the samsung displays god and its not just that

Iphones are decent in all catagories but android is just far superior, you make the phone look like you want and change how it functions entirly (plus you could easily get any app or song for free without breaking warrenty) 

I cant get myself to get any apple products because each one just becomes more and more of a cashgrab with each product, and theu would only really be worth the price and a 40-50% discount

Also apple and innovation dont really gp together, especially not the design up untill rhe 6 and x it was the same peice of crap phone design (not to mention blatently leaving in a bend gate to cut production costs), but the most innovative design was the xaomi mi mix until the, galaxy until the Find X (which might i add was an absolutly perfect way to hid the front facing components",2018-07-02 00:54:52
"I kind of don't get it, probably out of the loop pretty bad, but what were the issues between the two?

I just always assumed it was the OS and maybe a display or two on models since Android models rock different display properties. 

(Last iPhone I had was a 5 and switched back to Android after due to iTunes never working right, everything wanting to sync bothered me as I try to keep my phone a brick as much as possible and hate developers butting in, and lack of home screen customization. There was also a case where I lost all my music, photos, and contacts when my phone did an auto update and over the phone I was snobbly told to back up and that apple products work better together WHEN why is something that is supposed to INSTALL something doing the exact opposite of that by DELETING files... in apps that are apple certified so it's not like a third party mishap. 

Haven't gone back to apple since that one and have had an s5 and 3 s7's after so idk the full details but some of the features now are either niche, lack proper support, or is pushed in models for consumer feedback. Like I highly doubt Samsung would take audio ports out of their phones like Apple tried to do on the 9 or 10 hehe.)",2018-07-02 02:05:52

* download ADB for your particular computers' OS (linked in the above article)
* Enable developer mode on your phone
* Use the above guide and the ADB commands to uninstall the application

"Welcome to the best decision you've made in a while ;)

Seriously though.  I had the first iPhone all the way through (each phone in between) to the iPhone 5.  Had 3 iPads.  And 4 iPods from the original metal spinning hard drive to the later model touch sreens etc.  And I dabbled in iOS developing 3 apps that used to be on the app store (made a few hundred on em).

Then I switched to Galaxy/Android one day after having a few hours to toy around on a friend's

I've now gone from every Galaxy from that point to the Note 3, 4, 5, 7, 7 (lol), and now the 8.

Since then I have switched my parents from iPhones and iPads to Galaxys and Samsung tablets.  My wife too although she was just on an old LG something which was android so she doesn't count haha.

Why am I spouting off about ALL of that?

1) Shows I am not just an android fan boy, I had plenty of exposure to apple garbage.  Honestly I STILL believe apple was better up until around the iPhone 5 when Samsung started flying past them.

2) Shows even the excuse ""But I don't need all that extra shit, I am a simple person and prefer the training wheels style of apple"" is still not true as my parents are old and retired and absolutely love their new Android overlords and are now on their 4th or 5th phones.

3) Despite the Note 7 fuck up, I'm still here and loyal and honestly could not be happier with my current phone, and my past ones (even that Note 7 was bad ass).  Love my wife's new phone.  And we have my son on an LG G6 which is nice too.

P.S. Your favorite thing about Android will be watching Apple commercials when they announce 'new' features and you giggle as we've had that for YEARS now.

P.P.S. If you're looking for those ""must have"" apps I won't go off on an extensive list but Nova Launcher is a must and is worth the money for Pro.

But then they made me sign the paper that they're not responsible for any data breach. 


Really? The selling point for me and Samsung is Knox/security. Your contracted repairmen are making customers sign off their data if there's a defect covered under warranty. This is a BIG hole in the security.



Just venting. Tell me what you all think. I'm considering going on Twitter. Samsung called me to follow up on the repair with a survey and the lady claimed she had no idea that was the issue.

"I work in retail selling TVs, computers, cameras, etc. There's MUCH more to what makes a TV other than the screen size and resolution. 

The most basic, other than resolution, would be the panel type. More expensive panels have better colour reproduction, better viewing angles, and tend to be held to a higher quality control standard so tend to last longer. At the highest end of these panels currently available to consumers would be Samsung's QLED, and LG/Sony's OLED. OLED has the advantage of getting perfect blacks as each LED generates it's own light, eliminating the need of a backlight, and allowing OLEDs to be the most colour accurate panels. However, QLED is brighter, so it works better in a brighter room, and it doesn't have the risk of burn-in like OLEDs have.

Then there's what type of backlighting the TV uses. For simplicity I'll keep it to edge lighting, and full array lighting. Edge lighting is cheaper, but you get the drawbacks of worse image and colour quality, and you can notice dropoffs in brightness on certain parts of the screen. Full array lighting has LEDs spread all behind the panel for a more uniform and consistent backlight.

High Dynamic Range (HDR) is a feature that has become more common on TVs in the past few years. [Linus over here can explain it better than I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wthhc1s0Pig). 

Next is 4K upscaling. Almost no cable signal does 4K, unless you have a fiber optic TV box. So to get your standard cable signal filling up the full 4K screen, the TV has to upscale the signal, which basically means it has to generate extra pixels that weren't originally there. Generally, the more expensive the TV, the better the upscaling is. Right now Sony seems to have the best upscaling chips. Of course, you can get 4k content from online sources, or from a 4K Blu-Ray player with 4K disc though.

Other than that, as you pay more, Smart TV functionalities tend to be better and more snappy, speakers get better, etc. 

The main reason I would rather buy a TV from the big guys (Samsung, Sony, LG), rather than the small guys (Hisense, RCA, etc.) is overall quality and support. You will experience MUCH better support from the bigger companies, not only in customer service, but also in setting up third party devices such as universal remotes, etc. The big guys tend to have more authorized service centers also, where as you're pretty much out of luck with the small guys.",2018-07-03 13:58:33

"Thank you for posting this. I traded in my phone in in early February. 4.5 months later, in late June, my credit card was charged. I was told by Samsung that the phone had liquid damage. 

1. It did not. It was in excellent condition. 
2. I carefully went through the Terms and Conditions before sending my phone in, making sure it met each one. Nowhere is liquid or water damage listed in the T&amp;C. 
3. Samsung had the phone for over 4 months before discovering any damage. It sounds like the damage occurred while in Samsung's care, as yours did. 

I initialized a dispute with my credit card company very soon after the charge was made. I have contacted Samsung 7 times via phone and email, and they have been incredibly unhelpful.  The first representative said he couldn't find any evidence of liquid damage, which he thought was odd, nor could he find anything in the T&amp;C about liquid damage. They are still charging me, though. This post encouraged me to contact the BBB, which I have just done. We've been Samsung customers for a long time, but I am now seriously rethinking the purchase of any future products. Thank you OP. ",2018-07-04 12:33:10

"Only had my S9+ for a week. After 2 days Bixby had to go. 90% because button. A damn dedicated physical button in an inconvenient place for a single app/tool that a meaningful portion of owners will never use. Every button is an extra inlet for potential water damage on a phone that's supposed to be pretty strongly water resistant.

Also, I am completely uninformed about Bixby in particular, but I have a reluctance and paranoia about 'digital assistants' and their potential for breaching my privacy in a number of ways. So Bixby was a no-go for me right off the bat.

ALSO, I am a boring middle age man stuck in his ways. I've used smartphones since before Android - the old Samsung Windows Mobile phones 10+ years ago. They were horrible, of course. But I've had a way of doing things since Android 3 or so that I just haven't really changed. My stuff is setup as much like my old configs as possible. I don't want shiny new stuff. I want my old stuff, only faster and better. Bixby has no place in that.

All my yapping aside, the S9 and S9+ are absolutely fantastic phones and I'm extremely lucky the Verizon dude recognized me as a football teammate from 25 years ago so I got almost $500 off.

"I used my S9 Plus naked for a month. Absolutely loved the phone. Was a tad bit slipper when I was having my hands slightly wet from transpiration, decided to get a case before the beautiful glass was going to break one day. Was this close to getting the basic Samsung silicone black cover, didn't like the way it looked and the way it felt in the pocket, I then gave both the led cover (big fan in the past) case a view and then the clear view cover, said I wanted something different.

I instantly wanted to get the alcantara one until I remembered it ruins itself once it touches water. I then instantly bought the protective standing cover. Do not regret it one bit even tho it looks a bit weird on the back. The phone altho heavier, is easier to hold in your hand, the button pressing feels really easy compared to the naked phone, the stand is a huge huge plus and the way the back is made, if I have money or papers in my pocket, I don't risk pulling it all out once I grab my phone. The only actual minus is the extra weight, the phone now easily passed the 200g mark and the physical size increased. One think I'm a huge fan of however, is the fact that I know how sensitive OLED panels can be to direct sunlight, this case has big protruding lips over the top and bottom of the phone. I can easily put the phone on my table laying screen side down without an issue and if somebody calls or messages me, the edge lighting lights the table, I can easily tell basic whatsapp messages or facebook messages apart from actual sms texts.

Once you write these values, it will begin downloading a new firmware for the phone (the latest one). You'll eventually be prompted to connect the device to the PC. AFter connecting it, wait for at least 1 minute so that you don't get your phone randomly disconnected by Windows. After the one minute, press continue or start, it will start writing the new firmware to the phone.

After the process ends, the phone will be good as new. It will start normally and you'll have to write in a google account and a Samsung account. You'll be able of using your phone normally afterwards. Hope I helped!",2018-07-06 02:06:30

It doesn't matter if it has more or less battery, if it's big or small.
The only important thing is that these phones are from Samsung(best comoamy).That's why they are great, other things aren't important.

Seriously, if you're going to permanently cover the thing then don't worry about its looks. But I accept that these things are fragile. There is a compromise. Put it in a pouch. The pouch will protect it from drops when you are most likely to drop it (putting it in and out of your pocket and similar situations) but lets you use it in its fully naked glory.

I ordered from Amazon since its cheaper.

I use the Neo Hybrid case as my 'day-to-day' case where the phone is always in my pocket.  

I use the Wallet S case when I go traveling since the fold over cover provides a better grip when taking lots of photos (or having strangers take photos with your phone) and the cover also protects the screen when throwing the phone in my backpack going through airport security etc..  However, you could use the Wallet case as a day-to-day case as well.

The other thing I strongly recommend buying for the Samsung S9+, Google Pixel 2XL or any large size phone is a Phone Loop from [https://phoneloops.com/](https://phoneloops.com/).  I use the phone loop with the Neo Hybrid case above.  The reason is the phone loop gives you greater stability and control when using the phone and lowers the chance of dropping the phone.

"This phone is marvelous ~

Simply put, the display is incredible. Watching videos or scrolling through Instagram is very enjoyable and it gets hard to go back to other displays (we get spoiled :p)
The camera is excellent too and if you're not a huge camera savvy, it will suit all your needs just fine and keep you going for a long time.
The audio experience is really great too, plugged in or not. I underestimated having dual speakers as a feature but I end up using Dolby Atmos the most. Seriously, it's just fun to be able to play music in the house with your own phone speaker. Also, the AKG bundled earphones are pretty great too. Headphone jack is a plus.
S9 is surprisingly fast. I've had previous samsung phones and they always felt kind of slow, but this one doesnt lag and even after 4 months it performs the same as it did when I first got it.
Battery isnt its best feature but it comfortably gets me through 1 day and can last to 2 with some conservative usage.
The software isnt as annoying and Android 8.0 adds a bonus too. Just be advised that software updates for Samsung phones always take 5 billion years so just keep that in mind.

"Ok, I will try to provide some feedback for you. I actually have two pairs of level u headphones. I have the pros and a pair with anc.  I have two pairs because I don't always charge them everyday and when one dies I just swap them out for the other pair and charge the dead ones in my car.  I'm lucky enough to be in a semi construction job where I can wear these all day.  
I listen to music often but audio books are what I listen to the most. So on to the good news.
Work time..yes you will get 8 hrs out of these easily. I can make it a full day with music or books but most time I am starting and stopping often or taking calls..my working partner bought some after trying mine and loves them also. 
Now for the anc. I would say that it is decent. I think the main advantage is that they are ear buds and have a passive ability to block sound as it is so the anc doesn't have to be spectacular. I have been in loud server rooms for a whole day and don't know how I would have lived without the anc. It really helps but if you're looking for Bose quiet comfort level of anc it's not going to happen..those things are crazy good. As far as battery life. It's going to take a hit with anc on..if I had to guess because I haven't run anc all day for a while, I would say about 6 hours maybe a bit more. The good news is that these things charge very fast..you can plug them in for 15-20 min and get 1.5 hrs. 
Sound wise..I think they are good.. decently loud although I don't think any wireless headphones are loud enough. You do have access to Samsungs uhq sound if your using a newer Galaxy and yes it makes quite the difference. The sound is much more crisp.  Bass wise they are good..not crazy bass but I think they are just fine..
Comfort and build..I think they are very comfortable. I know not a lot of people like around the neck stuff but these are just fine..light weight and the build quality is the best out of the two. 
With pricing the way it has dropped lately I don't think you can go wrong with these..I was looking into the new around the neck headphones from Samsung but I don't think they support uhq or any other high def sound so that's a no go for me..
I purchased my standard pros at Sam's club for a good price and ordered the anc from Samsung. At the time they were fairly new so they were still pricy..
I hope this has helped you. I have had these for a while and the last thing I will say is that they are fairly durable. I am a pretty careful person with electronics but even still they are pretty strong.
Good luck .",2018-07-09 00:50:29

This is why you always request local ifixubreak. Samsung will cover costs and you get phone back in a few hours. I believe if ifixubreak not in your country, there's other options similar to it. 

 If you ever do have to ship. Take pics of phone current condition and todays newspaper with date on it. Make sure newspaper is in the background. Bonus with pics next to shipping material. That way you can't get fucked over.

"I had helped my friend switch from an iPhone 7 with Smart Switch and worked very well. It can't move everything (like certain messaging apps) but this works easily. It'll even match up existing apps and ask if you want to install corresponding Android versions. The only annoying part is that during the ""search"" process, the slightest movement of the cable will cancel it. For things that don't come over, check to see if the app has a backup cloud feature.

Most of the big apps are there and corresponding desktop services/apps are also there. Personally, I would look to moving things out of iCloud to allow other apps access to your stored data for the most flexibility. The biggest change could be Google Photos if you're not using it already. Moving files from iCloud to anything else is fairly trivial.

Samsung also has a backup service as well which you can choose to use or not. I think their backup services are decent. Pickup a MicroSD card for external photo storage. It'll free up app space on your phone. Samsung also likes to duplicate apps so you can choose to try others before deciding (like text messaging, contacts, gallery, etc) and then disable/hide the ones you don't want to use. This will probably most confusing part for a new user.",2018-07-10 12:46:45

"True.  When I updated my iPhone, suddenly I had only 25% of my original battery life.  I learned later, that they changed the way the radios were handled in low-power mode, and since I live in a zero-to-1 bar area, my battery life dropped to 2-3 hours (was getting 8-9 hours before, advertised for much, much more) a day before shutdown.  I've noticed this effect with different phones, manufacturers, and oses.

Like others have said, if it's still under warranty, take it in and let the shop have a look at it.

Was it always crap, or did it die gradually (or even suddenly)?

So many things can cause drain.  If you have great battery life in safe mode, then it's an app causing the issue.  If you prove it isn't an app to Samsung, then you can get a free repair, or in extreme cases, a replacement.",2018-07-10 22:28:30

Without video proof, even the 30 to 90 claim is beyond anything possible, especially with qualcomm quick charging 2.0 or samsung fast charging 1.0. I'm sorry. I've had quite a lot of phones, none from Samsung (even S6 which had a tiny battery) would charge THAT fast. The fastest charging phone I ever owned was this A5 2017.

"TL;DR: Huge explanation bellow about charging these phones. If you aren't in the mood to read, just watch the video linked bellow. It's showing pretty much everything I was saying up. Have a great day!

That's the case with most Samsung phones for a while now. My S9+ also charges quite a significant bit if plugged in the wall for like 15-30 minutes. Only requirement is that I turn off wifi/data when doing so and I get about 40&amp;#37; in 30 minutes. After that it charges slower and when I reach 90&amp;#37; it takes a full 20-30 minutes to hit 100. Which is normal behaviour. It acts this way to preserve the life of the battery.

Now. Pure proof of what I said earlier is, first of all, the fact that battery technology works this way. If you will start using the other 15&amp;#37; percent of the battery til' you hit 0&amp;#37;, you'll realise that the 15&amp;#37; left is lasting longer than as much as 30&amp;#37; of your normal usage. My old S6 once lasted me around 13 minutes on 1&amp;#37;. I wanted to fully drain it and recharge it. And the last 1&amp;#37; lasted more than about 10&amp;#37; did. There are talks about these phenomenons on the internet. Won't bother trying to find them.

My analogy for you (and I'm ending on this note) is the fact that all current Samsung phones that support fast charging, have the same exact componentry for charging. My S9 does not charger any faster or slower than your A8 or my A5 or even J series phones that support fast charging. The power brick delivers 10W in fast charging mode. Maybe my S9 will be 1-2&amp;#37; more efficient in handling that, but not enough for it to be noticeable in the long run. You'll maybe save 30 minutes of charging per year due to that efficiency increase.

[Here's a youtube video from a Hindi youtuber showing that in fact, it takes both the A8 and A8+ a normal amount of time to go from 0&amp;#37; to 100&amp;#37;.](https://youtu.be/KEIGhb6w4qg?t=88)

And judging by the increases seen here, it's physically impossible for your A8 to reach 90&amp;#37; from 30&amp;#37; in just 20-30 minutes, let alone 15-20.

Unless you had your phone repaired and you got a smaller battery placed in your phone (Something like 1500mA), you're either not aware of how long it actually takes to charge (because you're usually doing something else than spending time to check your phone religiously) or you're simply oblivious and pretty much assuming everything rather than basing off actual numbers.

And with that I'm ending my thesis here. I have owned many samsung phones both before fast charging was a thing and after and I have noticed always how long it took to charge a phone. A note 4 for example, does indeed charge slower compared to something like an S7 while an S7 charges barely any slower compared to an S9. Why? The charging technology inside the phone has improved through time quite a bit. We moved most of the charging components into chargers (hence they get so hot when charging a phone), and now the phone simply has to do minimal work. The same charger that shipped with the Galaxy Note 4 (first official fast charging Samsung device) has identical hardware on the inside with any samsung adaptive fast charger sold today. Identical. It can charge both Quick Charge 2.0 devices &amp; Fast Charge 1.0 devices just well.

And simply basing off the fact that the charger itself is identical, I can simply say our phones charge the same, exact same actually efficiency being slightly different from one phone to another but newer gen devices such as the A8 and S9 having virtually the same capability.",2018-07-11 07:48:07

"I already owned the Westones, so that part of the purchase was not needed.

To get customs, you pay an audiologist to make a silicone mold, which isn't expensive.  It feels funny, admittedly :) .

Those molds of your inner and outer ears are sent to the vendor who will craft them into custom fitted IEMS for you.  In many cases, those can be used as plug-in replacements for the generic inner ear molds with an existing IEM - such as the AKG model included with the Samsung.  You might have to specify the IEM model, potentially.

In my case, I used InEarz because they agreed to reuse my Westone hardware (i.e., they literally broke the shells open to get at their components), then create custom IEMs as single units for each ear, made to my specs (i.e., shorter inner ear depth, softer canal material, custom outer shell colours, 2-prong cable attachment type, Westone audio hardware).

I don't know if InEarz is still adapting existing IEMs to custom IEMs or if they only sell their own audio hardware (which includes the custom fit), but here's their process and links to prices, if curious:

https://www.inearz.com/how-to-order/

Their Representative at the time was pretty good at answering my questions before I started the order process.

Various threads at https://www.head-fi.org/ can help to get an idea on custom fitted IEM companies, btw.",2018-07-15 17:50:25

"I have a note 8, unlocked global phone and I use it on Verizon. I was trying to use my Samsung Pay and it wasn't taking my fingerprint or Iris scanning. So I uninstalled the app, cleared cache, reinstalled. I get to the app, and it has my information on the startup screen, asks me to ""get started"" and then I can never get it to do Iris identification. See attached screen shot. Short of formatting my entire phone, which I REALLY don't want to do, is there anything I can do to fix this?",2018-07-17 04:31:06
"Note 8 if you're going by those 2.
Hitting the fine points...
Note 8 has a 3300 mah battery, 6 GB of RAM. 6.3"" screen, dual 12 MP camera (8 MP on the front), 64 GB internal storage, 256 GB SD card slot, and the S Pen (which keep in mind isn't for everyone)
S9 has 3000 MAH battery, 4 GB of RAM, 5.8"" screen, single 12 MP camera with that lense that opens and closes (8 on the front), 64 GB internal and a 400 GB SD card slot.
So, unless the size of the phone and the SD card slot are important to you, then there you go.
Now, i actually sell these things on a daily basis, and i opted for the S9+ for my personal phone.

The S9+, IMO, surpasses the note 8 just barely.
It has everything the s9 has, but it separates itself with the 3500 mah battery, 6 GB of RAM and a 6.2"" display and that dual camera on the back which IMO beats the Note 8.

Keep in mind there are other things i left out. I just hit the hard hitting points. If you're really on the fence, wait a month. The Samsung announcement for the note 9 is next month.",2018-07-17 05:14:46

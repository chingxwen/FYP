Google is one of only a handful of smartphone manufacturers still making flagship phones that aren’t ginormous beasts, with the new Pixel 4 the cheapest in a while that significantly undercuts the competition.

Priced at £669, the Pixel 4 is £70 cheaper than last year’s Pixel 3 and £60 cheaper than Apple’s iPhone 11. It’s also cheaper than its bigger sibling the £829 Pixel 4 XL. The concern is: which corners have been cut and do they matter?

The 5.7in FHD+ OLED display has the same 90Hz refresh rate as the larger 6.3in version on the Pixel 4 XL. It looks very similar too, with good viewing angles, inky blacks and bold colours and smooth experience thanks to that high refresh rate. But it’s not the brightest screen available, which makes it fine for most things but not quite as bright as I would like in direct sunlight.

There’s the same large forehead containing the sensors for Google’s new Face Unlock and Motion Sense systems. The sides are aluminium, but with a black textured coating, while the glass back is frosted with a texture similar to super-smooth skin. Buy the white or orange version and the contrasting colours make the Pixel 4 stand out.

Combined with its slender proportions of just 68.8mm wide and 162g, the Pixel 4 is one of the smallest, lightest and easiest of top-end smartphones to hold and use. It’s a joy to be able to easily use a smartphone one-handed again. For comparison, Apple’s £1,049 iPhone 11 Pro is currently the best smaller phone available, but it’s 71.4mm wide and 188g, while the £799 Samsung Galaxy S10 is 70.4mm wide and 157g.

The Pixel 4 has the same 6GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and one of Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 as the Pixel 4 XL and performs identically – fast and fluid, but not quite as speedy as the OnePlus 7T.

Battery life was really poor. The Pixel 4 only lasts just over 14 hours between charges. Remove it from the charger at 7am and it will be dead by 9pm. Turning off the bells and whistles such as the ambient display only added about 40 minutes to the battery life. Anything under 24 hours simply is not good enough, particularly given I didn’t play any games or do anything particularly battery-draining.

That was while using it as my primary device, with 200 or so emails, messages and push notifications, two hours of browsing in Chrome, four hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 40 minutes of Into the Badlands from Amazon Prime Video, and three photos.

For comparison, similarly sized iPhone 11 Pro lasts 32 hours and the Pixel 4 XL lasts 26 hours under similar conditions, while the majority of smartphones in 2019 can last at least 24 hours with heavy usage.

The Pixel 4 fast charges at up to 18W via any USB-C Power Delivery charger, of which one is included in the box, and wirelessly charges at up to 11W. A full charge via cable took 105 minutes hitting 70% in 45 minutes.

The Pixel 4 is one of the first smartphones to ship with the latest version of Android 10, complete with system-wide dark mode, full theming support for changing colours, icon shapes, typefaces and more, and vastly improved gesture navigation. At least three years of software updates from the phone’s release are included and it will get Android version updates before most other devices.

The Pixel 4 also has the same new on-device natural language processing that was so impressive on the larger Pixel 4 XL. Google Assistant is much faster and works without an internet connection for many tasks. Google’s voice transcription app is equally excellent, as is the Live Caption feature.

The new Assistant still doesn’t work with Google’s own commercial G Suite accounts though, which is a bit of a blunder. Google says it’s still working on a fix.

Motion Sense uses radar to track motions around the phone. It lights up the ambient screen when you’re within 60cm, will silence calls or snooze alarms when you reach for the phone, and skip music tracks when you swipe in mid-air above it. The technology is more impressive than the functionality currently.

Google has dumped the fingerprint scanner for its new Face Unlock using 3D face recognition technology similar to Apple’s Face ID.

It’s seriously fast and worked through polarised sunglasses just fine. Look at the phone and it’ll unlock, skipping the lockscreen and taking you straight back into the last thing you were doing. Although technically you don’t need to actually look at it, as it’ll unlock with your eyes closed, which might be a problem for some. Google says it’ll add the option to require attention at a later date.

The biggest issue is that most third-party apps do not recognise Face Unlock, meaning without a fingerprint scanner they just assume the Pixel 4 doesn’t have a biometric input forcing you back to entering pins or passwords, which is tedious.

To use Face Unlock developers need to update their apps to support the new unified biometric system built into Android, with only a small handful having done so currently. For those that have done, such as LastPass, using Face Unlock is a seamless experience – just as Face ID is on an iPhone.

Given Monzo is saying it will take a while to implement, you can probably forget your traditional banking apps working soon.

Google has made a name for itself with some of the best smartphone cameras on the market, and the new dual-camera system on the back of the Pixel 4 is no different. It’s the same camera as that fitted to the Pixel 4 XL and performs the same.

That is to say it has fantastic still image quality, even in very difficult lighting conditions. Google is still the market leader with its Night Sight ultra-low light mode, but others have caught up considerably. New for this year is the ability to independently adjust the brightness of the background and foreground, which works very well. Portrait mode is improved, as is the up to 8x zoom thanks to the extra camera on the back. The selfie camera is relatively wide angle and pretty good, too.

Not so good is video capture, which caps out at 4K at 30 frames per second, not the 60fps rivals manage.
• None If you have your phone by your bed at night the ambient screen never shuts off because you’re typically within the Motion Sense bubble all the time
• None There’s a new Pokemon live wallpaper where you can wave at or pet Pikachu and others using Motion Sense
• None You only get free “high quality” image and video backup in Google Photos, not the full, original size backup that was included for three years with previous Pixel phones

The Google Pixel 4 costs £669 ($799) with 64GB or £769 ($899) with 128GB of storage.

For comparison, the smaller Google Pixel 4 XL costs £829 ($899), the OnePlus 7T costs £549, the Samsung Galaxy S10 costs £799, the iPhone 11 costs £729 and the iPhone 11 Pro costs £1,049.

The Google Pixel 4 is a potentially great phone hampered by really poor battery life. It doesn’t really matter how good you make a phone if it dies before the day is out.

And that’s a real shame as there aren’t that many manufacturers making fully-featured flagship smartphones in smaller sizes.

The screen is good and big enough. The camera is amazing. Motion Sense is novel and Face Unlock is seriously fast. The on-device natural language understanding is next level and Google’s software magic is thoroughly impressive.

But the Pixel 4 suffers from the same issues with G Suite, limited scenarios in which the screen works at 90Hz, lack of third-party app support for Face Unlock and no gaze-requirement for unlocking the phone as the Pixel 4 XL.

Even a comparatively lower cost of £669 isn’t enough to save the Pixel 4. If only Google had given it a bigger battery the Pixel 4 could have been one of the best smartphones on the market. Instead this feels like Google’s iPhone 7 moment – a great phone ruined by terrible battery life.

1,Cities,Hex in the city: which terrifying town hits Halloween hardest?,https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/oct/31/hex-in-the-city-which-terrifying-town-celebrates-halloween-hardest,2019-10-31T06:00:19Z,"On a dark, dark night, in a dark, dark town, on a dark, dark street, skeletons, witches and zombies gather. There’s even the odd devil or two. The legions of the dead have come together for an annual Halloween night parade that will be watched by thousands of costumed revellers. But this isn’t the US – a country most people consider to be the Halloween mothership – this is Derry, Northern Ireland.

The Derry Halloween festival started small in the mid-80s as a fancy dress disco in a pub. Now it has snowballed into a massive four-day event, with more than 120,000 people attending in 2018 – double the number from 2016. On Halloween night itself, there were 45,000 people watching the parade and fireworks. The sheer size of the extravaganza hasn’t gone unnoticed across the pond either, with USA Today crowning it the world’s best Halloween destination in 2015. So is it safe to say Derry is the capital of Halloween? Or are there other cities that go even further?

While 23% of revellers attending the Derry festival are travelling there from outside Northern Ireland, organisers claim its growth in popularity has more to do with local enthusiasm than clever marketing. Aeidin McCarter, head of culture at Derry City and Strabane district council calls it the “festival of the people”. It attracts people of all ages and everybody dresses up. You look strange if you don’t, she says.

“In most other organised festivals, you are bringing something to the people, but this is the people bringing something to the world,” McCarter says. “Halloween is to Derry what carnival is to Rio or what new year is to Edinburgh. Instead of Christmas stuff, supermarket aisles are full of Halloween merchandise. There are pop-up shops that have been open for the last three weeks selling purely Halloween things. People plan their costumes at least a year in advance. Even local people who have left the city come back. In the same way that people come back for Christmas, people from Derry come back for Halloween.”
• None Revellers at a Halloween parade in Greenwich Village, New York City

Ireland’s connection with All Hallows’ Eve dates back millennia to the Celtic festival of Samhain when spirits were believed to walk the Earth before the new year began on 1 November. It is thought the ancient tradition was first introduced to the US by Irish immigrants fleeing the potato famine of the mid-19th century.

Undoubtedly, Americans have turned what was once a religious rite into a secular spectacular. A terrifying 68% of people will celebrate Halloween, with the average household in the US spending $86.27 (£67) on the festival, adding up to a whopping nationwide total spend of $8.8bn. That’s a lot of treats. Speaking of which, it’s estimated that more than 41 million children aged five to 14 will go trick or treating in 2019 and $2.1bn will be spent buying sweets to give away on the night. Halloween is so lucrative for the country that the Halloween and Costume Association is petitioning the government to extend the celebration to include an additional day of freakish fun on the weekend after 31 October.

So which city in this Halloween-mad nation deserves the title of pumpkin king? After taking into account factors such as trick or treat friendliness, general fun and even the average weather forecast, website WalletHub did the maths and ranked New York City number one and Los Angeles a close second as the most spook-tacular places to enjoy the annual frightfest.
• None Halloween parades take place in Los Angeles and New York City

One of the most popular activities to do during Halloween is to attend a party or parade and both the top cities boast some of the biggest shindigs around. The largest event in New York City is the Village Halloween Parade on the evening of 31 October. About 60,000 revellers will join in the costumed march up 6th Avenue to 16th Street, while an estimated 2 million people watch it.

“It’s full of the energy and creativity of NYC,” says Jeanne Fleming, artistic and producing director of New York’s Village Halloween Parade. “The parade is a folk art phenomenon … it often reflects the zeitgeist of what is happening in the world and then all the individuals take that on. Its energy derives from its state of constant change and renewal with the underpinnings of ancient ritual.”

Over on the west coast, 500,000 partygoers take part in the West Hollywood Halloween carnival, which proudly celebrates its LGBT community with a mix of theatrical performers, over-the-top costumes and bawdy drag queens. West Hollywood also tops the US for most Halloween Instagram shares, based on hashtags and mentions. And with 17% of Americans claiming they dress their pets up for the occasion, the city of angels also plays host to several canine costume parades.

Their owners, meanwhile, could take inspiration from this year’s Google data, which reveals some of the most searched-for outfits in the US. The evil clown Pennywise from the film and Stephen King novel It is ranked the most popular costume in 2019, searched for most in five cities including Zanesville, Ohio, and Harrisonburg, Virginia. Spider-Man is a favourite in Meridian, Mississippi, and a dinosaur is a hit in several cities including Boston, Massachusetts. The top costume in the city of Bangor, Maine, however, is a character from the game Fortnite. If you’re looking for a less scary option, head to Fairbanks, Alaska, where a fairy is the costume most Googled.

Although Bonfire Night on 5 November has traditionally been the main autumnal festival in England, Halloween has had a huge spike in popularity in recent years. In 2018, more than half of UK households (51.5%) spent money on Halloween-related products. According to figures from Statista, spending almost doubled in five years, from £230m in 2013 to £419m in 2018.

The UK has the most Halloween-themed events listed on the Eventbrite website, outside of the US. That’s followed by Canada, Australia, and Ireland. In fact, the number of UK Halloween-related events listed on the website has more than trebled since 2015, to about 2,000 events across the country this year. Most of those are hosted in London, followed by Glasgow and Manchester.

One trend that the company has noticed is the increasing number of heritage sites hosting haunted house events. The 300-year-old Mansion House in York – voted the UK’s most haunted city in 2002 – is one such historic venue keen to embrace Halloween by hosting their own family friendly ghost tour.

Mansion House marketing manager Ellie Davies says: “It’s a beautiful Georgian building and lends itself well to that spooky aesthetic. We’ve decorated the whole house in cobwebs, we have sinister creaking noises, headless ghosts and spooky silhouettes.”

The local tourist board has been promoting York’s haunted reputation and making the most of Halloween’s surge in popularity, says Davies. “We have got everything that makes York a spooky city. We have got the Shambles, we’ve got hidden doors in walls, we’ve got creepy archways and old buildings. It all comes together to create this spooky environment and people are wanting more and more.”

For children, one of the most exciting aspects of Halloween is trick or treating. But the quality and quantity of your haul may depend on where you live. According to 2017 data from Statista, Brighton is the best city to knock on neighbours’ doors for sweets, with residents forking out an average of £18.60 per person on Halloween treats each year. On the other hand, children living in Hull are less lucky with just an average of £1.70 a year spent on Halloween treats.

Halloween appears to have the ability to not only cross continents but also cultures. One city in which it has taken root is Tokyo, Japan. Large scale celebrations first began at the capital’s Disneyland theme park but have now spread across the city. Residents have embraced the western festival, blending their own tradition of “cosplay” – or “costume play” – with the supernatural horror themes of Halloween.

The biggest event in town is the massive Kawasaki Halloween Parade. It only started in 1997 but now attracts more than 100,000 people who line the 1.5km route through the Tokyo district dressed as everything from a Samsung phone to a giant toothbrush. As well as this, the annual Harajuku-Omotesando Hello Halloween Pumpkin Parade features more than 3,000 costumed children under 12 parading along the 700-metre zelkova tree-lined section of Omotesando. Shibuya on the other hand has been the scene of Halloween mayhem in recent years with extra security being brought in this year to stop impromptu street parties from spiralling out of control.

As Halloween fever spreads around the world, not everyone is happy about what is seen as a US import that is displacing their own cultural traditions. Despite its critics, the festival is showing no signs of slowing down. So haters better fire up the cauldron, dust down their pointy hats and polish those fangs, because if you can’t beat them, join them.

2,Technology,Labour calls for halt to Google's acquisition of Fitbit,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/29/labour-calls-for-halt-to-googles-acquisition-of-fitbit,2019-10-29T15:27:46Z,"Labour has written to the competition regulator calling for Google’s reported acquisition of Fitbit to be halted, at least until a wider inquiry into anticompetitive practices in the technology sector is completed.

Google made an offer to purchase the fitness tracking company on Monday for an undisclosed price, according to Reuters.

Tom Watson, the shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary, has written to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to request it halt the acquisition pending a full investigation of its effect on the competitive landscape.

“I have long been concerned about the data monopolies that dominate our tech market, including Google,” Watson writes. “These companies hold and gather an unprecedented amount of data on users which is then monetised through micro-targeting and advertising to amass huge profits and power. Meanwhile, the digital giants themselves remain unaccountable, unregulated, and see themselves as above the law. They have run rings around regulation for far too long.

“This is not just a business deal, it’s a data grab – and that should worry us all. Any such proposal must be subjected to the most rigorous possible scrutiny and must be fully investigated by the CMA.”

Watson specifically singles out the fact that Fitbit stores physical health data for users, who track their activity and exercise with the company’s range of connected wearable devices, as cause for concern.

“If this acquisition were to proceed, Google could have information on how we sleep, when we move, what we eat, on our breathing and our heartbeats. This data could hardly be more sensitive, but as is Google’s business model, all this information could then be used [for] micro-targeting, advertising, and behaviour modification. The risk to consumers here is significant,” Watson writes.

The CMA has already announced one market study into whether or not Facebook and Google dominate online platforms and digital advertising. Watson argues that, at a minimum, all acquisitions such as Fitbit should be paused “until the CMA’s market study is concluded and its recommendations are implemented”.

Watson has also written to the Information Commissioner’s Office expressing concern over the data aspects of the merger, calling on Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, to assess whether it raises privacy concerns and feed that back to the CMA.

Google has provided a fitness tracking service, Google Fit, since 2014, but the company has never offered its own hardware to go along with it, instead relying on third-parties such as Samsung to produce Android Wear smartwatches.",-0.0378,
3,Technology,Google Pixel 4 XL review: not quite ready for primetime,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/29/google-pixel-4-xl-review-not-quite-ready-for-primetime,2019-10-29T07:00:18Z,"Google’s latest Pixel 4 XL smartphone is its bravest yet, throwing out the conventions of old, integrating cutting-edge technology and attempting to round it all out with a special mix of software direct from the Android-maker.

By now you probably know the drill. The Pixel 4 XL is a metal and glass sandwich like practically every other phone. Unlike most though the aluminium sides have a black textured coating, which aids grip, while the back feels almost like super-smooth skin or silk rather than glass. It also has bold, contrasting colours, if you choose the white or orange variant, that make it stand out well against the competition.

The 6.3in QHD+ OLED screen is big but not massive by today’s 6.5in-plus standards. It has a 90Hz refresh rate, but just in certain lighting conditions for now, which Google says it’s working on a fix to increase. Generally it makes the experience of using it smoother and more fluid. It’s crisp, colourful and has good viewing angles but can’t reach the same super-bright heights as rivals – the 90Hz display on the OnePlus 7T Pro has far more wow factor. A chunky top bezel hides a new Face Unlock system and Google’s new party trick: the Soli radar system.

The Pixel 4 XL is a large phone that doesn’t feel too big in the hand. The textured sides and frosted glass back help with grip. I never felt I would drop it. At 8.2mm thick and 75.1mm wide it compares favourably to Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro Max and the OnePlus 7T Pro, while undercutting both by as much as 29g.

It feels like a phone you’re meant to use without a case, rather than something that needs protecting – although dropping it runs the risk of it smashing, like any other phone, so whether people will use it without a case is another matter.

The bottom has a USB-C port, the back supports wireless charging, there’s an accent colour on the power button and you can still squeeze the sides on the bottom half of the phone to activate Google Assistant.

Speed, but not for long

The Pixel 4 XL has 6GB of RAM, at least 64GB of storage and one of Qualcomm’s top processors, the Snapdragon 855, which was only recently replaced by the slightly faster 855+ as used in the OnePlus 7T and 7T Pro.

In day-to-day tasks the Pixel 4 XL felt fast and fluid – significantly faster than a Samsung Galaxy S10, but not quite as super-slick as the OnePlus 7T. Most will be very happy and the Pixel 4 XL is likely to continue feeling fast and responsive a couple of years down the line if the previous generation Pixels are anything to go by.

What’s not so great is battery life. The Pixel 4 XL only lasts just over 26 hours between charges with medium usage, which means 7am on day one until 9am on day two in the working week. That’s not really long enough to guarantee the Pixel 4 XL will be alive and kicking at the end of a night out to see you home.

That was while using it as my primary device, with 200 or so emails, messages and push notifications, a couple of hours of browsing in Chrome, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 50 minutes of Into the Badlands from Amazon Prime Video, and taking about 15 photos.

For comparison, the OnePlus 7T lasts 34 hours or the similarly sized iPhone 11 Pro Max lasts just shy of 48 hours under similar conditions. Turning off the ambient display feature added about two hours to the battery life.

The Pixel 4 XL fast-charges at up to 18W via any USB-C Power Delivery charger, one of which is included in the box, and wirelessly charges at up to 11W. A full charge via cable took just under two hours, hitting 70% in 50 minutes.

The Pixel 4 XL is one of the first smartphones to ship with the latest version of Android 10, here with a level of polish only OnePlus rivals, and a bunch of Pixel-exclusive features, some of which will make it to third-party smartphones at some point.

Android 10 introduced a system-wide dark mode, full theming support for changing colours, icon shapes, typefaces and more, and vastly improved gesture navigation, which makes using large-screen smartphones a lot easier. You’re going to get at least three years of software updates from the release of the phone, and major Android version updates before anyone else.

The big new Pixel 4 XL software advance is on-device natural language processing. Normally when you speak to your phone for Assistant, search or similar, it sends what you say across the internet to be understood on Google’s server farm.

Now Google has managed to make that technology run on the phone itself, with some very impressive results. It’s considerably faster, recognising what you say instantly, doesn’t require an internet connection, and is better for privacy because your voice doesn’t leave the device.

A new version of Assistant uses it to great effect. You can rattle off commands at breakneck speeds and it will understand the lot. If you want to open the camera, shoot a photo and share it to a friend you can now do it faster with your voice than you probably can with taps.

The Google Recorder app is equally impressive, transcribing voice recordings on-device in real time and tying text and audio together so you can search through them. Lastly Google’s new Live Captions can put subtitles on any video, even if it’s muted – perfect for those who can’t turn the sound up but want to know what’s happening in a video.

These thoroughly impressive software features are what Google does best.

Unfortunately the new Assistant only works in US English for now. Worse, you can’t use it if you have a G Suite account (Google’s commercial services including email) logged into your phone. Google says it’s working on a fix.

One of the products of Google’s advanced projects research division is Soli, which is a miniaturised radar system enabling the new Motion Sense feature. It detects when you’re within 60cm and shows the ambient display. Reaching for the phone lights up the screen fully and gets it ready to recognise your face, but it can also snooze alarms and silence calls.

A swipe through the air above the phone can skip tracks in music apps or from the lockscreen, and more gestures are promised. It worked well when on a desk, but was harder to trigger when handheld.

The technology is certainly novel and works surprisingly well, but these sorts of gestures aren’t a new thing and I’m not sure Google has hit on the killer feature for Soli yet.

Google has dumped the fingerprint scanner for its new 3D face recognition technology. Face Unlock works essentially the same way as Apple’s Face ID, except faster. A little too fast in some instances, unlocking the phone when I didn’t actually intend to. A simple glance at the phone is all that’s required, although you don’t actually need to have your eyes open for it to recognise you – which might be a problem for those with prying partners. Google says it’s working on a fix (can you spot the trend here?).

It works through polarised sunglasses and not once did it fail to recognise me. By default it skips the lockscreen and opens the phone straight up to whatever you were doing, which I wish Apple’s Face ID did.

But most third-party apps don’t support Face Unlock now. That’s because to do so they have to implement a new unified biometric system which allows the phone to decide whether to use a fingerprint, a face or something else. Most don’t, which means they don’t even see the Face Unlock system.

Used to just using my fingerprint for everything, I’d forgotten what a pain entering strong pins or 55-digit passwords into apps can be. Once apps are updated, using Face Unlock with apps such as LastPass is a fantastic, seamless experience; the kind of experience you’ve had on a top iPhone for the last three years.

Fewer than 10 apps currently do so, though. And even leaders in fintech such as Monzo are saying it will take a while to implement, so you can forget your traditional banking apps. At least this one isn’t up to Google to fix.

Google has made a name for itself with some of the best smartphone cameras on the market, and the Pixel 4 XL is no different, now with a dual-camera system on the back. It is arguably the best point-and-shoot camera available.

Still photos are full of drama and with an amazing amount of detail, even in very difficult lighting conditions. New for the Pixel 4 XL is the ability to manually alter the foreground and background brightness independently. Portrait mode for people, pets or objects is also improved particularly around things such as wisps of hair.

A 2x telephoto camera has significantly improved the zoom, using the firm’s Super Res Zoom technology to reach to 8x while still preserving a lot of fine detail. It compares favourably with the iPhone 11 Pro, but can’t hold a candle to the 5x optical and up to 50x digital zoom of the Huawei P30 Pro.

Google’s Night Sight mode continues to lead the market in capability and flexibility, and can now shoot three-minute exposures of stars with astrological mode – not that I could test that given the British weather over the last two weeks.

The single selfie camera is also good, with a wider angle than most front-facing cameras. Video capture is generally solid, but caps out at 4K at 30fps and is by no means market-leading. If video is your medium of choice there are better cameras than the Pixel 4 XL. The lack of the fun ultrawide-angle camera popular with other manufacturers is also disappointing, as is Google dumping free full-resolution Photos backup, which has been a Pixel value-add for years.
• None If you have your phone by your bed at night the ambient screen never shuts off because you’re typically within the Motion Sense bubble all the time – there really needs to be a scheduler or for the display to turn off when you activate do-not-disturb mode.
• None There’s a new Pokemon live wallpaper where you can wave at or pet Pikachu and others using Motion Sense.

The Google Pixel 4 XL costs £829 ($899) with 64GB or £929 ($999) with 128GB of storage.

For comparison, the smaller Google Pixel 4 costs £669 ($799), the OnePlus 7T costs £549, the OnePlus 7T Pro costs £699, the Samsung Galaxy S10+ costs £899, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ costs £999, the iPhone 11 costs £729 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max costs £1,149.

There will be a time when the Google Pixel 4 XL might be a great phone, but that time isn’t now.

I love the design, the feel, the 90Hz screen and incredible camera. The new on-device natural language understanding is a marvel. The next-generation Google Assistant feels like we’re finally putting the kind of AI we’re used to seeing in films in our phones, not on some server somewhere providing the illusion of being in our devices. This is the smartest phone I’ve ever used and I genuinely enjoyed Google’s moments of magic.

But for every feature that’s good, there’s a problem that needs fixing. The screen’s great, but not always at 90Hz and not always bright enough, and the battery life just isn’t long enough for a top-end phone in 2019.

The fact that the new Assistant doesn’t work when you have a G Suite account on your phone – a product made and sold to companies by Google – is frankly embarrassing. As is the oversight that some may want to make sure they’re actually looking at their phone with their eyes before it unlocks – Apple knew this and has had it in Face ID for three years.

The biggest issue for me, however, is that the Android app ecosystem just isn’t ready for a phone that has dumped the fingerprint sensor. Face Unlock is genuinely great. A transformational leap just as Face ID was three years ago on the iPhone X, but only when it works. And it doesn’t work in my banking apps, my security apps or Evernote. Only one app I routinely use a fingerprint with supports Face Unlock.

That situation will change once all the apps have been updated, but I’m not holding my breath for the very slow-moving banks to support Face Unlock any time soon, and that’s a real problem.

The Pixel 4 XL is therefore a very hard phone to grade. Once Google fixes the problems and apps have been updated, the only thing really holding the phone back is below-average battery life. If that’s something you can live with, and you trust Google to fix things, then by all means buy the Pixel 4 XL.

But at £829, or really £929 if you want a reasonable 128GB of storage space, there are better, problem-free experiences to be had out there from the likes of OnePlus, and for less money too.

4,Technology,AirPods Pro: Apple launches noise-cancelling earbuds,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/28/airpods-pro-apple-launches-noise-cancelling-earbuds,2019-10-28T17:25:14Z,"Apple has launched a new set of its popular true wireless earbuds with traditional silicone tips and noise-cancelling software.

The AirPods Pro have a similar design to the current non-isolating AirPods, complete with white stalks and an ultra-compact case. But instead of a plastic duct that rests in your ear, allowing sounds from the outside world to be heard over music, the AirPods Pro aim to block it all out.

Earlier AirPods, or Apple’s wired EarPods before them, are practically impossible to hear on noisy public transport. That means users often crank up the volume to potentially hearing-damaging levels, while risking annoying those around them with sound bleeding from their ears due to the lack of isolation.

Apple hopes the AirPods Pro will solve that problem. Like other noise-cancelling headphones, the new earbuds have a pair of microphones on each unit that detect unwanted noise and use the speakers to cancel it out with an inverse soundwave before it hits the wearer’s eardrum. That lets users hear their music at significantly lower volumes in noisy environments.

A “transparency mode” allows wearers to pipe sounds from the outside world into their ears, while vents equalise pressure to avoid the plugged-in feeling.

The AirPods Pro also have adaptive equaliser technology that tunes the sound to the shape of the individual’s ear.

The earbuds have up to five hours of continuous playback time – 4.5 hours with noise-cancelling active – and the case can provide an additional 18 hours of charging. They also support hands-free “Hey Siri” activation for Apple’s voice assistant, and can announce messages when they arrive on an iPhone. The earbuds are also sweat-resistant.

The AirPods Pro cost £249 in the UK or $249 in the US, and ship on 30 October.

5,Technology,Which is best: iPad Air or iPad Pro 11?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/oct/24/which-is-best-ipad-air-or-ipad-pro-11,2019-10-24T07:01:09Z,"I use a 9.7in Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablet for general browsing, emails, reading digital magazines and some very basic photo editing. It only has 32GB of storage so some apps are installed on its 128GB SD card. However, the battery is no longer what it was, and Samsung has not updated its version of Android, so it is still running Android 7. I am thinking of getting a new iPad because Apple seems to support machines for longer, the apps seem better suited to my needs and, anecdotally, they appear to be more secure. On my budget, I can’t decide between an iPad Air with 256GB and an iPad Pro 11 with 64GB. Both will fit in my camera bag. Is it better to opt for a tablet with more built-in storage or one with a better processor? Len

The challenge for anyone designing a computing device – whether it’s a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone – is to create a machine that is properly balanced to meet its user’s needs at the price being charged. This is not an exact science. It depends on the cost of major components such as the processor and memory, screen, graphics, storage modules, operating system and so on. But you trust them not to saddle low-end devices with the cost of high-end processors, or to compromise high-end devices by providing too little memory and/or storage space.

This is the problem with both the iPad Pro 11 and 12.9, and why you are stuck with a choice you should not have to face.

It’s not hard to read the trends in the technology market, and two obvious ones apply here.

First, people need more storage to handle both apps and digital content that is now cheap or free, and, thanks to higher broadband speeds, easy to download. We’re no longer listening to 64kbps MP3 files or watching 640 x 480-pixel movies, and file sizes are much bigger than they used to be. So are web pages.

Second, the cost of Flash memory chips has been falling at a rapid rate, even while they have been growing in size. I can remember being chuffed at buying storage cards for only £1 per megabyte. Today, I can buy 128GB cards for less than £20, which is 64 megabytes per penny.

Under the circumstances, 64GB is only fit for smartphones, Chromebooks and netbook-type Windows laptops. Shipping a high-end £769 tablet such as the iPad Pro with only 64GB is insane. It should have 128GB, which would be a rational fit with companion models that have 256GB (£919), 512GB (£1,119) and 1TB (£1,319). Then, each step up would double the storage.

There’s another way to look at this. If you buy a 64GB iPad Pro 11 then you are paying £12 per gigabyte of storage. If you buy the 256GB version, the price drops to £3.59 per gigabyte, and at 1TB it’s only £1.29. Putting 128GB in the entry-level model – £6 per gigabyte – wouldn’t make it a bargain, but it would be in line with the rest of the range. And the extra cost of fitting 128GB would be peanuts at retail prices, without even considering the massive discounts Apple must get for buying them by the million.

In short, I don’t think you, or anyone, should buy a 64GB iPad Pro. Either bust your budget and buy an iPad Pro 11 with 256GB of storage space, or get an Air with the same amount.

Alternatively, wait for Apple to release new versions of the iPad Pro that start at 128GB. This could happen in November – the current models were released in November last year – or perhaps in March 2020, or later. Your Tab S2 isn’t dead yet …

You’re already an experienced tablet user with 160GB of storage, so you should have a good idea how much space you will need. My own rule of thumb is to try to double everything with each new device, because you will always need more of everything in the future, and less-than-doubling rarely feels like a real advance.

Unfortunately, tablets, smartphones and ultra-thin laptops don’t let you upgrade the processor. You’ll be stuck with it for the next five or more years. It’s a good idea to aim high.

With storage space, however, you have some flexibility. Lots of devices have SD card slots, and as you know, this is a cheap and convenient way to alleviate problems with machines that don’t have enough built-in storage. Although Apple’s hardware designers would never soil their hands with a microSD slot, the company sells a Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader cable (£29), and there are other ways to tackle the problem.

The Apple-approved method is to store as much as possible online in its iCloud rather than on the device, and to stream content such as music and movies rather than playing it locally. Streaming often depends on having a usable broadband or mobile connection, which can lead to buffering. It may also consume bandwidth and server resources, so it isn’t very green.

The alternative is to use add-on storage. Standard USB drives don’t plug into iPads, but several companies offer drives that fit into Apple Lightning or USB Type-C ports. You can also buy external hard drives that have wireless connections and iPad apps, so you can store data without making a physical connection. WD’s MyCloud (from £120) is one example, and Macworld suggests several alternative solutions.

In the case of cloud storage and streaming, remember that you can use any cloud – Dropbox, Microsoft’s OneDrive, Google One etc – not just iCloud. Also, you can stream music and movies wirelessly from a local PC or NAS server, if available.

Perhaps you could manage with only 64GB of storage, if you put up with the extra cost of add-ons, and the extra inconvenience. It’s not too hard if you have a PC to do the heavy lifting. But if you are paying £769 and it’s your main device, as this seems to be, you shouldn’t have to.

The 10.5in iPad Air (2019) is pretty much the same as the 10.5in iPad Pro (2017), only faster, so naturally the iPad Pro 11 (2018) has several advantages. These include the slightly larger screen, which is brighter (600 v 500 nits) and supports a 120Hz refresh rate, which Apple calls ProMotion. It also has an eight-core A12X Bionic chip, where the Air has the smaller six-core A12 version used in the iPhone XR and XS. Both include embedded M12 motion coprocessors, plus the eight-core “Neural Engine” that the entry-level iPad’s A10 Fusion chip lacks.

The extra power of the A12X supports the doubling of the screen refresh rate from 60Hz to 120Hz, which should make a difference when playing games or using the Pencil, but it’s not a dealbreaker for most purposes. In fact, the two chips are so similar that pundits are expecting new versions of the iPad Pro with improved A13 processors, like those in the new iPhone 11.

The iPad Pro 11 has a slightly better camera with Face ID for logging on, whereas the Air uses Touch ID. Lastly, the Pro supports a second-generation stylus whereas the Air only supports the original Apple Pencil, though these come at extra cost. Otherwise, on Apple’s comparator, there is no significant difference in screen sharpness (both are 264ppi), size, weight or battery life.

The question is whether you would derive any significant benefits from the iPad Pro 11’s better features. It seems to me that unless you plan to get into gaming or drawing, you’d be paying for things you don’t really need. You’d be better off spending your budget on accessories for the iPad Air. The options include a keyboard (£159), Apple Pencil (£89), and AppleCare (£69) from Apple, as well as all kinds of products from other suppliers.

6,Technology,Apple Watch Series 5 review: the king of smartwatches,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/23/apple-watch-series-5-review-the-king-of-smartwatches,2019-10-23T07:00:30Z,"Always-on screen completes the package kicking competitors to the curb and becoming a top reason to buy an iPhone

When Apple launched its smartwatch in 2015 to a lukewarm reception, some critics claimed it would never take off like the iPod or iPhone. But sales of the Apple Watch quickly eclipsed every other smartwatch and with wearable technology sales soaring it is expected this year to outsell all of the Swiss watchmakers combined.

The latest Apple Watch Series 5 iteration, though still pricey at £399 and up, looks likely to continue the firm’s domination of the smartwatch market and deservedly so.

If you are unfamiliar with Apple’s smartwatches, they only work if you also have an Apple iPhone 6S or newer connecting to the smartphone via Bluetooth. It’s a genius link-up that ties buyers into the Apple ecosphere, while adding an important alternative revenue stream as people hold onto their phones. But that doesn’t take away from the extraordinary qualities of this watch.

The Series 5 builds on last year’s larger-screen redesign of the Apple Watch, making one small but important change: the screen now stays on all the time.

It’s a feature every other smartwatch has had for years and is important for actually telling the time, which is absolutely essential for something to have a permanent place on my wrist.

Until now Apple Watch owners had to either tap the face or do an elaborate wrist rotation gesture to get the screen to light up – and it never worked when I really needed it to, such as when running for a train. Now you can see the time at a glance at any time or angle.

The rest of the Apple Watch has always been top notch. Equipped with the right strap – if you haven’t tried the Sport Loop or one of its many clones you absolutely must – the Apple Watch is the most comfortable timepiece I’ve had the pleasure of strapping to my wrist, beating some of the very best the Swiss watchmakers have to offer.

It’s neither heavy nor light, and hides the heart rate sensor in a curved lump on its belly comfortably sitting atop your wrist. It fits easily under shirt cuffs, which some larger smartwatches don’t. It’s water resistant to depths of 50m, which means you’ll likely never have to worry about it when you take a dip in the pool.

The screen is bright and crisp, clearly visible in all circumstances. I’ve never been a massive fan of the rectangular shape, preferring my watches to be of the circular variety, but the Series 5 has won me round over the last month.

Apple still leads the way on haptics – the little vibrations and taps the watch makes to let you know something has happened. I loved them with the original in 2015, and they’re still miles better than anything else on the market five generations later.

Victim of its own success

One thing you might not appreciate until you strap one to your wrist is that there are so many of them out there in the wild, all looking the same. I’m not one to conform to any particular fashion or club, so I often get that twinge of embarrassment you feel when you walk into a room and spot someone wearing the same shirt or dress.

It’s made a little better with the Series 5 now you can have the screen on all the time and pick a slightly different face, but by putting one on you instantly become one of the Apple Watch people.

Apple provides loads of watch faces, which are all infinitely tweakable in colour, with many having dial customisation. Then there’s a sizeable collection of widgets for things like timers, the weather, activity and others called “complications”. But I’ve found there’s always something not quite perfect about each face that I can’t change. I love the new Numerals Duo face, but I wish it could have the date on it too. I really like the Meridian analogue face too, but wish it had an option for numerals not just ticks.

I also find the round analogue faces hard to read at a glance even on the 44mm Series 5 because they’re just bit too small. I’m being picky here, but that’s the thing about something you wear – if it’s not quite how you want it you’re going to notice it and be annoyed by it over and over.

Of course the Apple Watch does more than just tell the time.

Notifications are a high point. A little tap on the wrist and you know something has happened. Most you can interact with in some way. All of Apple’s apps work well, of course, but so do third-party apps. The Nest and Ring apps show photos of events from cameras for instance.

Messaging apps including Signal and WhatsApp can be marked as read or replied to straight from your wrist. You can dictate what you want to Siri, draw out letters one at a time or send canned responses or emojis.

Most Apple Watch apps aren’t up to much, but one that bucks the trend is the Spotify app, which gives you full control of playback on your iPhone from your wrist, including volume control using the digital crown. But it can’t store music offline unlike the Apple Music app.

Apple Pay on your wrist is great too. Double press the big side button to bring up the card and then just put it near the reader as you would a phone or contactless credit card.

Siri is great when it works, but can be hamstrung by poor network conditions.

“Hey, Siri” works fine, but activates fairly often when I don’t want it to, ditto for raising your wrist to speak to Siri. I deactivated both features and didn’t miss them. Setting timers, reminders, alarms and other bits via Siri work great, but things start to fall apart with more complex tasks or questions. It’s the same on an iPhone, more or less.

There’s no Google Maps app on the Apple Watch, which is disappointing. Apple Maps is getting better, but it’s really not that great in the UK. Citymapper offers an Apple Watch app, which is certainly better for getting around London and other major cities.

Apple has slowly turned its smartwatch into one of the best multipurpose fitness trackers available. You name it, the Apple Watch can track or record it, apart from one glaring omission: sleep.

The workout app has modes to track a huge list of activities and sports, from your usual running, walking, hiking, cycling and swimming to yoga, tai chi, dance, football, badminton, hockey, table tennis and even fishing.

The Apple Watch automatically looks out for some workouts too. I get a notification to track an outdoor walk twice a day on my commute, which I found annoying enough to turn the feature off.

For running the Apple Watch is surprisingly good, tracking everything a mid-range dedicated Garmin running watch would, including performance stats such as VO2 Max. It’s got a long enough battery life with everything going to track a marathon, but I certainly feel it more as a lump on my wrist than my go-to Garmin Forerunner 235. There’s a dedicated Strava app for the Apple Watch if that’s your jam.

Day-to-day health tracking is solid. The heart rate sensor measures your beats per minute throughout the day, logging it upwards of 12 times an hour or on-demand for you to view in the newly revitalised health app on your phone. But it can also notify you of abnormal heart rates, which are typically high when you’re not doing anything.

You can also manually take an electrocardiogram (ECG) by placing your finger on the crown for 30 seconds or so. The apps shows you the waveform in real time and notifies you if your heart beat looks irregular.

Other daily activity tracking takes the form of Apple’s activity rings: move in calories, exercise in minutes and stand in hours, complete with nags to stand up each hour if you haven’t already. Steps and distance are also recorded, along with flights of stairs climbed, and you get awards if you beat your goals. Exporting your activity is fairly restricted, but as all the data is stored in Apple Health you can connect to third-party apps.

Included too are menstrual cycle tracking and fall detection. New for the Series 5 is the noise app, which monitors environmental noise and warns you if you’re in conditions that could damage your health. It also measures headphone volume on the iPhone, which may be just as useful for those listening to music too loudly.

Battery life was the key worry for the Apple Watch with an always-on screen. Thankfully, I can report in day-to-day usage I was left with no less than 40% battery at the end of a day. It won’t manage two 7am till 11pm days, but it won’t fail you if you go for a run during the day or similar.

An 18-minute, 4km run with GPS, heart rate monitoring, pace alerts and the screen always on consumed only 3% battery so marathons should be no bother.
• None The default app view is still the old honeycomb matrix of apps, which is hard to use, but can be switched to an easier and faster simple list with a hard press
• None Taking calls on your wrist is novel and works amazingly well, but embarrassing when people stare at you in public (which is similar to attempting to talk to Siri)
• None 4G is only useful if you happen to go out without your phone, so you can stay in touch seeing notifications, receiving messages and calls, or using maps if you’re lost

The Apple Watch Series 5 comes in two sizes, various different materials and models with the option of 4G.

The aluminium or Nike versions are available with or without 4G. The 40mm costs £399 or £499 with 4G. The 44mm costs £429 or £529 with 4G.

All other Apple Watch versions support 4G. The stainless steel model costs £699 (40mm) or £749 (44mm), while the titanium Edition starts at £799, the ceramic Edition starts at £1,299 and the Hermes starts at £1,249.

For comparison, Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Active 2 starts at £269, the Fossil Gen 5 smartwatch starts at £279, the Huawei Watch GT 2 costs £200 and the Fitbit Versa 2 starts at £200.

Since its second generation the Apple Watch has been the best smartwatch for the iPhone. But for the Series 5 that’s changed. It’s not just the best smartwatch for the iPhone. The Apple Watch is now a solid reason to buy an iPhone in the first place.

The screen being on all the time that was the last piece in the Apple Watch puzzle. What started out as a bit of a let down in 2015 has since been refined, sped up and had meaningful features added to it that make it far more than the sum of its parts.

After five generations Apple has finally nailed it, but that’s not to say the Series 5 is perfect. It would be great to have sleep tracking to close the circle on health tracking. It would be better if it lasted at least two days so you could go on a weekend away without bringing the charger.

I wish there was a circular version too for variety, and it would be better for everyone if they didn’t all look the same like some sort of clone army. Strap one of these to your wrist and you become part of a tribe: the Apple Watch wearers.

Then there’s the price. At £399 and up the Apple Watch Series 5 is in no way cheap. The Series 3 is still on sale from £199, but doesn’t do it for me with that mostly-off screen. With the competition mostly coming in at under £300 the Series 5 has Apple’s typical premium – but it’s a premium anyone considering an Apple Watch has already paid for their iPhone.

Simply put, the Apple Watch Series 5 is the best smartwatch you can buy right now. You might just need to also buy an iPhone to get it.

7,Technology,OnePlus 7T Pro review: the best kind of deja vu,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/22/oneplus-7t-pro-review-the-best-kind-of-deja-vu,2019-10-22T06:01:16Z,"Still an absolute beast in every way, even if it’s just a minor update to an already cracking smartphone

The OnePlus 7T Pro is an update to the best phone of the first half of 2019 and the good news is that they haven’t messed up, with tweaks that make it just as good, if not better, than the model it replaces.

The bad news is that the updated phone starts at £50 more than its predecessor, at £699, although as it also comes with more storage and RAM; in effect it matches the cost of the earlier mid-range 7 Pro version. It also gains a faster processor, an improved camera and a slightly tweaked paint job.

The star of the show is the 6.67in 90Hz QHD+ AMOLED screen, which is just as stunning as it was five months ago. Once you get used to the smoothness of 90Hz display it’s very difficult to go back.

The popup selfie camera removes any notch at the top, while the bezels are still thin all round, with curved sides reaching a slim metal band at the sides and a curved glass back. It’s an attractive, incredibly modern-looking design with excellent build quality.

The 7T Pro is just as big and heavy as its predecessor: 206g, 162.6mm tall, 75.9mm wide and 8.8mm thick. While much more manageable than Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro Max (77.8mm wide, 226g) the 7T Pro is still a beast that is right on the limit of usability – those with smaller hands will struggle. The 7T may only be a little bit smaller with its 6.55in screen (74.4mm wide, 190g) but the difference is palpable.

Flip the phone over and you’re treated to a slightly lighter but equally gorgeous shade of blue for the glass back. There’s also a new laser focus patch to the left of the vertical camera lump. The USB-C socket in the bottom is the only input for charging or connecting wired headphones.

The OnePlus 7T Pro is faster on paper than its predecessor, with Qualcomm’s slightly newer Snapdragon 855+ chip, which has 15% faster graphics and a slightly faster processor.

Whether anyone will be able to tell remains to be seen. The OnePlus 7 Pro was already the fastest-feeling phone available, and the 7T Pro is no different, powering through things with an immediacy unrivalled by anything else on the market.

There are two versions available. The standard, widely available 7T Pro comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. A McLaren Edition, with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, as well as a new black and orange paint job, will also be available in limited quantities.

All that speed is backed up by solid battery life of about 32 hours between charges – four hours longer than the OnePlus 7 Pro and enough to last from 7am on day one until 3pm on day two.

That was as my primary device, with the usual deluge of email, messages and push notifications, lots of browsing, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, watching 50 minutes of Into the Badlands on Amazon Prime Video and shooting about 10 photos a day.

Despite the glass back, there’s still no wireless charging. Instead, OnePlus has reduced the internal resistance of the battery to make it charge even faster, hitting 70% in 34 minutes and full in just under 70 minutes.

The 7T Pro ships out of the box with OxygenOS 10, based on the latest version of Android 10, making it one of the first phones to do so, just like the 7T.

OxygenOS continues to set the standard for custom versions of Android from third-party manufacturers, focused on refinement and speed. Full theming support for changing the colour and shape of screens, icons and boxes, including a full dark mode, is new for this version. But it is Google’s new swiping navigation gestures, replacing the custom ones used by OnePlus on previous phones, that are the biggest improvement.

Swipe up on a bar at the bottom of the screen to go home, up and hold for recently used apps, or left or right to jump to a previously used app. A swipe in from the left or right side in the lower two-thirds of the screen is now used for going back, which is a vast improvement, making using large-screen phones much easier.

The traditional three-button Android navigation bar is available if gestures aren’t your thing. New privacy controls for location data are also welcome.

OnePlus offers software support for at least three years from release, including two years of Android version updates and then a further year of security updates on a bi-monthly schedule.

The 7T Pro has an even faster version of OnePlus’s excellent in-display optical fingerprint reader, which continues to set the standard for speed and accuracy, matching traditional capacitive sensors and putting everyone else to shame.

The 7T Pro has the same triple camera system, combining a 48-megapixel main, a 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle and an 8-megapixel telephoto camera, as its predecessor and performs similarly.

The primary camera is great, capable of capturing some really good, finely detailed and well-exposed shots that aren’t too far away from what you get from the very best on the market. Low-light performance was solid. A revamped version of OnePlus’s Night Scape proved to be more effective and can now be used on the ultra-wide angle camera too.

The 3x telephoto camera (which is technically 2.87x rounded up) is also good, but produces noticeably more noise in dull lighting than the main camera. It has optical image stabilisation and 1x more magnification than the cheaper 7T.

The 10x digital zoom rivals the best, but isn’t in the same league as Huawei’s 50x zoom. The ultra-wide angle camera was great fun, and the 7T Pro also gains OnePlus’s new super macro mode. Focusing on objects at a minimum of 2.5cm away takes a bit of practice but you can produce some really interesting images, rich in detail the human eye can’t see on its own.

Video quality was generally pretty good too, but could be a little yellow in indoor lighting. The popup 16-megapixel fixed-focus selfie camera was also capable of capturing some great, detail-rich images.
• None The stereo speakers are some of the best
• None A screen protector comes pre-applied, while a good clear plastic case is included in the box

The OnePlus 7T Pro costs £699 in haze blue with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The McLaren Edition with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage costs £799.

For comparison, the OnePlus 7T costs £549, the Huawei P30 Pro costs £749, the Samsung Galaxy S10+ costs £899, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ costs £999 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max costs £1,149.

The OnePlus 7T Pro is the best kind of deja vu: an exact copy of arguably the best smartphone of the first half of 2019 with an improved camera, slightly longer battery life and a slightly faster processor.

Whether an update was really required is debatable, but OnePlus has made a name for itself with this rapid, six-month refresh schedule.

The camera’s new macro mode is great fun and can produce some spectacular images. Android 10’s new gestures have made handling the phone easier, the fingerprint scanner is even faster and having the very latest Snapdragon 855+ processor keeps the 7T Pro at the top of the pile on paper, even if the difference is hard to see.

The 7T Pro starts at £50 more than its predecessor, but also comes with more storage and RAM, matching the cost of the mid-range 7 Pro version.

It still has the downsides of its predecessor too: there’s no water resistance rating, no wireless charging, no expandable storage or headphone socket, the camera is good, but not quite iPhone 11 Pro standards, and it’s massive and fairly heavy. But that gigantic, gorgeous, fast and notch-free screen is still something to behold and the curved glass and metal band make it just about manageable.

Class-leading performance, extremely fast charging and a battery that’ll last 32 hours round out a device that still undercuts rivals and offers a better experience in almost every way. The biggest challenge to the 7T Pro is actually OnePlus’s cheaper (£549), smaller 7T, which offers much the same but is easier to handle.

If you want the biggest, best screen, in the fastest, slickest device, that’s the OnePlus 7T Pro. A massive phone still worth stretching for.

8,Music,Amazon's music festival prizes commerce over culture – it must be resisted,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/18/amazon-music-festival-intersect-prizes-commerce-over-culture-it-must-be-resisted,2019-10-18T12:59:18Z,"First it was books, then it was the Kindle. It was DVD box sets, then it was making the shows themselves. It was CDs, then it was streaming, and now, a music festival.

The next step in Amazon’s iterative takeover of western culture has been announced for December in Las Vegas: Intersect, a two-day festival featuring acts including Foo Fighters, Beck, Kacey Musgraves and Anderson .Paak. It also promises a “postapocalyptic dodgeball stadium,” a “mega-sized ball pit with over 200,000 balls”, visual art installations, and games including one where you try to mash buttons at high speed. The latter is the perfect symbol for the enterprise: one that values immediate sensory thrills over deep cultural engagement, and which tries to press every pop-cultural button as hard and fast as it can in an attempt to succeed.

The lineup faces firmly towards the millennials and Gen Z hipsters that Amazon so need to ensure ongoing relevance: leftfield black talent such as Flying Lotus, HER, Thundercat and Jpegmafia; new indie stars like Japanese Breakfast, Snail Mail and Miya Folick; dance tracks from Jamie xx, Max Cooper and Gesaffelstein. The Black Madonna, another of the DJs booked to play, has reacted with horror at the festival announcement, saying that Amazon’s name was not mentioned on the paperwork she signed.

Musgraves, meanwhile, is set to perform alongside “500 Intel drones programmed and flown by a female-led team in a tribute to women’s contributions to advancements in technology”. Given there is a gender pay gap of 11.6% among computer programmers in the US, way above the national average of 4.9%, this is a wretchedly offensive and banal initiative. With this, and its excellent, studiously diverse music lineup, Intersect is merely an attempt to gild Amazon with wokeness and credibility.

This is nothing new. Music is the most cheap and easily available cultural form of all, accessible via streaming, radio, YouTube and elsewhere. Compared with film, TV, literature or anything on stage, it is also the cheapest and easiest to make, as grassroots scenes from blues to UK drill attest. So music has an immediacy and authenticity to it that is absolute catnip for brands, who long for such qualities in their own advertising – the simplest way to access it is to simply shackle themselves to the music.

Red Bull is the master of the craft, nurturing musicians in its Red Bull Music Academy and publishing music journalism – before it switched tack to its own festival held in London last month headlined by Aphex Twin. Savvier still is Boiler Room, the live-streaming, brand-supported dance music site who have started their own music festival but also their own advertising agency, leveraging the cool – and the data-led audience insights – they have earned over the last decade to sell back to brands. The two other big names in streaming, Spotify and Apple, have their own music events: the former’s Who We Be festival returns for a third year in November, while the latter has replaced its Apple Music festival with its Up Next Live concert series.

Other music festivals may not be run by brands or advertising agencies, but they feel that way. Over the last two years it has been a strange and ghastly experience walking through London’s All Points East festival (whose branding aesthetic is echoed by Amazon’s Intersect), where the brilliance of the artists – Björk, Nick Cave, etc – is dulled by vast walk-in advertising experiences for Jägermeister, Samsung, Tinder and others.

This co-opting of musical space by branding has become so normalised that the head of one hip independent London music company told me that its audience see them as more, not less legitimate if they do brand partnerships. A PR for Red Bull recently assured me, regarding coverage of one of its events, that “this is not a sponsored/branded event, the event is produced and owned by Red Bull”, as if it was a Medici-style cultural patron rather than an energy drink brand.

But we should rail against this normalisation. To walk through a music festival that only exists because of a branding imperative is one of the most spiritually bereft experiences in cultural life. It’s almost worth going to them just to get the bracing sense of music being played for its own sake at others: the bucolic idyll of Green Man and End of the Road, or Glastonbury, where the only branding you see – beyond the glorious font of alcoholic glucose that is the Brothers cider bus – is for Oxfam, Greenpeace and WaterAid.

I just returned from Poland’s Unsound festival, one of Europe’s best. Aside from some unobtrusive sponsorship from Brooklyn Brewery at the closing party, the festival is funded via a variety of European and Polish bodies – it essentially insulates people from commerce for a week by deploying public funds. To me this is such an important psychic state: to not feel hectored to consume, as you do at so many branded festivals. Arts funding has an important role to play in clearing that space.

Unsound’s truly global lineup – from Kazakhstan to west Africa – meanwhile is not mere clout-mining or box-ticking in the manner of Intersect, but rather a product of true artistic passion and a desire for profound cultural conversation. Sure enough, it was only here or the likes of Glastonbury, rather than in the repugnant branded spaces of other festivals, that I could really lose my mind – or, as Intersect festival hopes for itself in perfect brand-speak, “create new paths of expression and new ways to engage your senses”.",0.9991,
9,Technology,OnePlus 7T review: the new cut-price flagship king,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/16/oneplus-7t-review-the-new-cut-price-flagship-king,2019-10-16T06:00:16Z,"The OnePlus 7T takes the best bits of the brilliant OnePlus 7 Pro and condenses them into a smaller, cheaper package.

Released less than four months after the last version hit the shelves, the new £500 7T doesn’t mess much with the winning formula, simply adding a better camera and market-leading 90Hz screen technology.

OnePlus launches new phones every six months or so, typically with improved specifications and small tweaks to the design. While the 6T to 7 transition wasn’t a particularly big step other than a new processor and faster fingerprint scanner, the 7T brings the 90Hz screen from the 7 Pro to the smaller, cheaper device.

Although you probably couldn’t tell unless put side by side with its predecessors, the 7T is 4mm longer, with a screen that’s slightly taller, and with a smaller widow’s peak notch for the selfie camera. Some 18 months on, the design still feels fresh, particularly compared with some phones with massive notches.

The 90Hz 6.55in Fluid AMOLED screen is the star of the show. It’s very bright, smooth and a pleasure to use. At Full HD+, it’s less pixel dense than the QHD+ screen on the 7 Pro, but you’d be hard pressed to tell, and the screen is flat, not curved at the edges, which is less visually arresting, though some might prefer it in use.

The front glass meets a polished metal band at at the sides, while the curved glass back and narrow 74.4mm width make the OnePlus 7T one of the easiest large-screen smartphones to hold, particularly when compared with the 6.5in iPhone 11 Pro.

The back also has a new large circular lump containing a new triple camera system, which looks fairly attractive, though you can feel it with your fingers in normal use.

New for the 7T is a bump to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855+ chip, which has 15% faster graphics and a slightly faster CPU, but is otherwise the same as the Snapdragon 855 in the 7, and many other smartphones this year.

In the UK, the rest of the specifications have been reduced to one option: 8GB of RAM and 128GB of UFS3.0 storage, with a 256GB version available elsewhere, effectively eliminating the cheapest 6GB RAM configuration from its predecessor.

The phone absolutely flies. Every action has a sense of immediacy that’s unrivalled in the smartphone industry. Now with the 90Hz display, everything is even smoother and more enjoyable – even mundane things such as scrolling through web pages or social media posts are pleasurable.

Battery life on the 7T is slightly worse than the 34 hours of the 7. The new 7T lasts 31 hours between charges with medium to heavy usage: 200 or so emails, messages and push notifications, a couple of hours of browsing in Chrome, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 90 minutes of Into the Badlands from Amazon Prime Video, and about 15 photos.

That means the 7T reliably makes it from 7am on day one until 2pm on day two. There’s no wireless charging, but the improved Warp Charge 30T technology sees the 7T hit full charge in 60 minutes from flat, which is half an hour less than the previous version and one of the fastest available.

The OnePlus 7T ships with Oxygen OS10, which is based on the very latest Android 10, making it one of the first smartphones on sale to use it.

OxygenOS continues to be one of the best implementations of Android, focusing on speed and customisation. New for version 10 is a complete theming engine, which in addition to the usual wallpaper changes, allows you to customise the colours of buttons, the background, the shape of icons and dialogue boxes, the font, the ambient clock display and even the fingerprint scanner animation.

Also new is the integration of Google’s new Android 10 gesture navigation, which eschews the traditional three-button or two-button navigation system for a new gesture bar. Swipe up on the bar to go home, up and hold for recently-used apps, or left or right to jump to a previously-used app. A swipe in from the left or right sides in the lower two-thirds of the screen is now used for going back.

Some may hate the new gestures, but the back swipe in from the side makes using a large smartphone a lot easier. You can hide the bar altogether or switch to the old-style three-button navigation bar.

OnePlus has made its market-leading in-display optical fingerprint scanner even quicker and more accurate than it was on the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro. Given how many times you unlock your phone or authenticate in an app with your fingerprint, speed and accuracy make a huge difference to the overall experience.

The OnePlus 7T matches the performance of traditional capacitive sensors and puts everyone else to shame. This is how it’s done.

New for the 7T is the triple camera system on the back. The main 48-megapixel camera has optical image stabilisation, and is joined by a 12-megapixel 2x telephoto camera and a 16-megapixel ultrawide camera.

The combination allows you to shoot photos and video at 0.6, 1 or 2x optical zoom or up to 10x digital zoom.

The results are very similar to the OnePlus 7 Pro, with the main camera capable of producing some great photos, full of detail, with solid low-light performance. The Night Scape low-light mode is improved too, although still can’t hold a candle to Google or Apple’s versions.

The 2x telephoto camera is noticeably sharper in good lighting than the 7 Pro’s 3x, but still worse than the main camera in less-than-ideal lighting. The 10x digital zoom matches the quality of competitors. The ultrawide angle camera continues to be fun and suffers from less lens distortion at the edges than others.

New for the 7T is a class-leading macro mode that can focus at a minimum distance of 2.5cm from the ultrawide angle camera. That’s about a quarter of the distance of most and produces some simply astounding, highly-detailed macro shots with a bit of practice. If you’re at all into macro photography, you will absolutely love this feature.

While generally good, the camera can be a bit unpredictable, over-exposing some scenes and often being far brighter indoors than you’d expect. A little manual adjustment is often required to get the photo just right.

Portrait mode lags behind competitors, matching the performance of the top phones from a few years ago. The 16-megapixel fixed focus selfie camera is pretty good, capturing a good amount of detail in varying light conditions.

Video capture up to 4K at 60 frames per second was good, but not quite up to par with the best, while the 960fps slow motion was fun with bright lighting.
• None The screen comes with a pre-installed screen protector, but it creates a sharp edge over which you have to swipe
• None The OnePlus alert slider on the side of the phone continues to be wonderful, if a little smaller this time around
• None The included TPU case is one of the best I’ve seen bundled with a phone
• None The “shelf” in OxygenOS continues to be not worth using, and would be better replaced by Google’s Discover feed
• None The first 7T tested had a fault with the screen displaying colour inconsistency manifesting as a green tint to the dark greys used in dark mode in various apps

The OnePlus 7T costs £549 in glacier blue or frosted silver shipping from 17 October.

For comparison, the OnePlus 7T Pro costs £699, the Samsung Galaxy S10 costs £799, the Samsung S10e costs £669, the Honor 20 Pro costs £550, the Google Pixel 3a XL costs £469, and the iPhone XR costs £629.

Simply put, the OnePlus 7T is the cut-price flagship phone to beat. It offers the same super-fast performance and silky smooth 90Hz screen experience as the bar-raising OnePlus 7 Pro, but in a smaller, lighter and cheaper package.

At 6.55in the screen is still large, bright and good-looking, squeezed into a more manageable body. The battery life is solid, if not class-leading. The camera is capable of capturing some great-looking photos but can’t match the best in the industry. You get the class-leading in-screen fingerprint scanner, excellent OxygenOS software with at least three years of updates, and seriously fast charging.

It doesn’t feel quite as luxurious in the hand as the 7 Pro, nor does it have the wow factor of the its gigantic, notchless screen, but it’s also significantly cheaper, even if it starts at £50 more than its predecessor.

At £549 the OnePlus 7T is a bargain, offering an experience that is simply unrivalled by anything remotely near it in price.

10,Technology,South Korean startups gather momentum,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/15/south-korean-startups-gather-momentum,2019-10-15T09:28:23Z,"In a country where the biggest companies are still king, Seoul’s burgeoning startup sector is finding its feet.

Out in the west of the South Korean capital, a nine-storey building dressed in bright colours with a giant red bull outside is home to more than 100 startups. From one-person operations running out of a locker and a laptop on the ground floor, to fully-fledged offices on the upper levels, Seoul’s startup hub has supported 1,282 operations in various stages of growth in the past two years.

It has all the bells and whistles you come to associate with startup hubs across the world – shared dining and working spaces, a rest area with beanbags and egg-shaped couches, a fully decked-out kitchen for food-tech companies, a broadcast studio, a library, a slide between two floors and even a 7-Eleven for those powering through the night.

There were about 467 accelerators, venture capital funds and government organisations supporting startups in Seoul and its surrounding province in 2018, some backed by bigger companies such as Samsung and Naver. There are 85 accelerators in Seoul, and the amount of angel investment increased from about US$170m ($250m) in 2015 to US$250m in 2017.

Since 2015, the South Korean government has provided $4bn to startups, Forbes has reported, the biggest government backing of startups per capita in the world. In April, Seoul’s mayor, Park Won-soon, said the aim was to make Seoul a global top five startup city by 2022.

Korea is particularly attractive for startups because of its high-speed internet, the fast rollout of the 5G network and the high uptake of technology.

The push towards startups has been driven by slow growth from the traditional larger companies, according to Seoul Startup Hub co-founder Matt Kang.

“We have lost the momentum from large companies – startups have emerged as a new momentum for Korea,” he said.

One startup that moved into the hub just over a month ago is Amuse Travel– a social enterprise that provides tours for people living with disabilities to popular destinations around South Korea, as well as giving people living with disabilities the confidence to travel on their own. The company develops maps of tourist destinations based on data collected during the tours, highlighting the area’s positive and negative aspects – such as steep inclines, stairs and other barriers to access.

The company’s founder, Seo-yeon Oh, said it had previously had difficulty raising enough investment, and needed more time to prove its viability of the company. He said Naver had expressed interest in the business.

Moving into the startup hub meant Oh and his staff were able to network with a variety of businesses at various stages of life.

“The strength of this hub is there is a wide spectrum of startup companies here from fintech to senior citizens, and also … startup companies which once experienced failure in the past,” he said.

“Koreans seem shy, so they seem to work alone or independently, but they also co-work and work together.”

It’s like a smiley face, but yawning. Happy?

And it’s new, is it? Honestly, it’s just not that big a deal.

I’d just like to know where it comes from, is all. It’s a really boring story.

Still. Fine: like all emojis, the yawning emoji was born of a two-year process that starts with a proposal to the Unicode Consortium, an international nonprofit organisation that sets the standard for the representation of characters across various programmes and platforms.

You’re kidding. I wish. In its most recent annual update, Unicode announced the introduction of Yawning Face – AKA U+1F971 – along with dozens of other emojis.

But who proposes new emojis in the first place? Anyone can submit a proposal, but successful emojis must meet all the criteria.

Which criteria? Emojis must be graphically legible when very small, and they have to be useful.

What possible communicative uses could there be for a yawning emoji? Actually, now that it’s here, I can’t think of an occasion on which I wouldn’t use it.

Because you’re tired all the time? Tired, or bored, or supremely unconcerned, or merely underwhelmed, or peremptorily dismissive of enthusiasm shown by others.

I see what you mean. What did we ever do without a yawning emoji? I can’t remember. I think we used to type out the word “yawn”.

Every time? How tiresome. Exactly. Yawn.

Where is it, though? I can’t find a yawning face among the sea of little round emoting heads on my phone’s menu. That’s probably because you’ve got an iPhone. Each “vendor” is responsible for adding the new batches of emojis and Apple hasn’t done so yet. Yawning Face will be included in the iOS 13.2 update, which is due out imminently; it has been rolled out on Twitter and Facebook, as well as Microsoft, Samsung and Google devices.

So, what other fun and useful emojis can we expect this autumn? There are some new hearing aid and wheelchair symbols, while the Holding Hands emoji will be available in 75 permutations of gender and skin tone. Also garlic, a plate of falafel and a five-string banjo.

Huh. What if I wanted specifically to reference a four-string banjo? There’s still time to get your proposal in for next year.

Do say: “I couldn’t care less about the new Yawning Face emoji [Yawning Face emoji].”

Don’t say: “Man, I stayed up so late last night! U+1F971 U+1F971 U+1F971.”",0.994,
12,Sustainability unwrapped,‘Shades of grey or yellow are not a solution’: making recycled plastics attractive,https://www.theguardian.com/product-innovation-with-henkel/2019/oct/09/shades-of-grey-or-yellow-are-not-a-solution-making-recycled-plastics-attractive,2019-10-09T15:55:55Z,"Plastic packaging has many amazing qualities. It keeps our food fresh and holds liquids without going soggy. It can also be moulded into a variety of shapes and, unlike glass, it doesn’t shatter if you drop it. But one of the qualities that makes it so useful – its durability – also means that it takes approximately 450 years to biodegrade.

It’s therefore imperative that we reuse, redesign and recycle plastic packaging so that it doesn’t end up buried in landfill or clogging up our oceans for centuries to come. But given that only about 14% of plastic packaging gets recycled today, there’s clearly a lot of work still to do – especially when it comes to creating packaging designs that are easier to recycle, use less material and contain more recycled plastic.

One of the biggest barriers to better designs is the higher cost and more constrained supply of recycled plastic compared with virgin types. So, from April 2022, the UK government plans to introduce a new tax on plastic packaging that does not contain a minimum of 30% recycled content. It hopes this will transform the economics of sustainable packaging by driving up demand for recycled materials and discouraging the production of single-use packaging with no recycled content.

The EU also wants to make all plastic packaging across Europe recyclable or reusable by 2030, and is allocating an additional €100m on top of current spending to research better designs, durability and recyclability. Initiatives such as the Alliance to End Plastic Waste and the New Plastics Economy, which aim to build momentum towards a plastics system based on circular economy principles, have also brought together stakeholders from across the plastics value chain to rethink the way plastics are designed, produced, used, recycled and reprocessed.

Black plastic, which is often used to package ready meals, is high on the list of packaging that needs redesigning. The near-infrared technology found in plastic sorting facilities uses light reflection to identify different types of plastic and sort them appropriately. But due to the presence of carbon black, those ready meal trays and other types of black plastic simply absorb the light rather than reflecting it back to the machine, effectively rendering them unrecyclable.

Henkel, the global chemical and consumer goods company behind well-known brands such as Loctite, Pritt, Sellotape and Schwarzkopf, Dylon and Colour Catcher, decided to tackle the black plastic problem in partnership with its colouring supplier, Ampacet. Together they developed a black plastic that uses an alternative carbon-free black colour, which can be detected by sorting machines. “We have already begun integrating it into our product portfolios, starting with our bottles of toilet-cleaning products,” says Dr Thorsten Leopold, head of international packaging development for home care products at Henkel. In time the carbon-free colour should be rolled out across all the company’s black plastic packaging, which will ensure this formerly “unrecyclable” plastic doesn’t become waste.

The project is part of Henkel’s goal of making 100% of its consumer packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025, while also increasing the share of recycled plastic in its European consumer goods products to 35%. In order to meet these targets, Henkel’s packaging developers follow three main principles: prevent, reduce and reuse. This means producing less packaging and waste, developing better packaging and enabling a circular economy. For example, the company’s Laundry and Home Care and Beauty Care businesses have recently launched packaging made solely from recycled plastic – up to half of which is also classed as Social Plastic.

This Social Plastic comes from Henkel’s partnership with Plastic Bank, a social enterprise that aims to reduce the amount of plastic waste in the environment while helping to alleviate poverty in countries such as Haiti and the Philippines. It encourages people to collect plastic waste and bring it to Plastic Bank recycling collection centres, where it can be exchanged for money, goods or services. The Social Plastic is then integrated back into the plastic supply chain. In total, approximately 200 tonnes of collected Social Plastic will be processed for Henkel this year.

Pierre Defaix, global purchasing category lead for plastic resins and masterbatches at Henkel, says that part of the appeal of the partnership is the proven scalability of Plastic Bank’s solution for tackling ocean plastic. “Its business model tackles the environmental challenge of ocean plastic,” he adds, “but it also has a social dimension that addresses poverty and the lack of work opportunities for many people ... We want to create the demand that will help this business model fly.”

As well as using more Social Plastic in future, Henkel is also exploring other ways of improving the lives of plastic collectors. “Early this year, for instance, Schwarzkopf included four Plastic Bank collectors in its Million Chances charitable initiative, which supports projects that empower women to build a successful personal and professional future.

“This is in the Philippines, where Schwarzkopf teaches disadvantaged young people hairdressing skills so they can change their lives by developing a steady income,” says Defaix.

Several issues have to be taken into consideration when incorporating more recycled plastic into product packaging. For instance, the properties of recycled plastic – such as its colour and odour – are more varied than those of virgin plastic. “This is something of a challenge for our supply chain, but also for the performance of our products,” says Leopold.
• None Bottles produced from recycled plastic on the Social Plastic production line; Philippe Blank of Henkel

Certain colours of recycled polyolefin plastics, for instance, are hard to source in large amounts. Recycled PET plastic also tends to be less transparent than a virgin equivalent, and may have a greyish or yellowish tinge. That poses a challenge when it comes to creating beauty products with shelf appeal. “Obviously there’s a huge demand from our marketeers, and also from the consumers themselves, that the product, in terms of packaging, needs to be attractive,” says Philippe Blank, head of innovation and sustainability for Henkel Beauty Care. “It’s not a solution to end up with beauty packaging that only comes in shades of grey or yellow.”

In some cases, designers might add a coloured tint to recycled PET to hide the fact that it’s not as transparent as the virgin kind. Sleeves that completely cover the bottle are another option. “That means you can put a lot of recycled plastic into the body,” says Leopold, “and the greyish or yellow colour of the bottle is covered by the sleeve. That’s a nice example of how smart design can foster the use of recycled plastic.”

Smart design is also part of Henkel’s approach to making multi-layer packaging more sustainable. This type of packaging, which consists of multiple layers of film, foil, plastic or paper, is tear-resistant, lightweight and good at keeping out external factors. However, the layers are difficult to separate during the recycling process, so the packaging is often incinerated or thrown into landfill sites after use.

The padded mailers that protect e-commerce purchase during transit fall under this category of packaging. Around 20bn of them are used each year, which adds up to a heavy environmental footprint – one that Henkel engineers have helped to make a bit lighter by designing a new type of recyclable mailer. “The product that we came up with can be put straight into the paper recycling bin,” says Marcin Lapaj, global business development manager for the circular economy at Henkel. “It shows how a traditional product can be reinvented and made in a different way, with circularity as priority number one.”

Of course Henkel isn’t the only company that’s trying to make plastic packaging more sustainable. In the UK, Coca-Cola has developed new technologies that mean 100% of the packaging the company uses in its “Smartwater” bottles is now recyclable. Samsung, meanwhile, has substituted all the plastic packaging used for its products for environmentally sustainable materials such as recycled and bio-based plastics and paper. And where these companies lead others will hopefully follow, so that plastic waste becomes part of the past rather than the future.

13,Technology,iPhone 11 Pro Max review: salvaged by epic battery life,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/iphone-11-pro-max-review-battery-camera-screen,2019-10-09T06:00:56Z,"A great camera, screen and performance can’t save horrendous ergonomics, but at least it’ll last two days on battery

The biggest, most expensive new smartphone from Apple is the iPhone 11 Pro Max, and you’ll need a small fortune to buy it.

The new 6.5in iPhone 11 Pro Max costs from £1,149 and is in effect its smaller 5.8in iPhone 11 Pro sibling put in a photocopier with a 12% magnification applied.

It has the exact same aluminium and glass design, the same notched screen with Face ID, the same camera arrangement on the back and the same Lightning port in the bottom. It is the same phone. Except that enlarging everything (apart from thickness) by 10%-12% creates a very different experience.

Like the iPhone XS Max it replaces, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is really difficult to use with one hand. At 77.8mm it is hand-stretchingly wide, wider still than the already massive OnePlus 7 Pro (75.9mm) and even the positively gigantic Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ (75.9mm), and at 226g it is heavier than competitors by a full 20g. But more than that, the rounded stainless steel sides provide no grip at all, meaning your fingers simply slip off them when you stretch across to reach the other side of the screen or the top left corner, which you frequently need to do in iOS.

It’s a combination that either results in hand pain or wallet pain, as it slips out of your fingers and plummets on to the unforgiving floor below. You then stick it in a case, which makes it even bigger. If there was ever a phone to benefit from a grip accessory of some kind, this is it.

So unless you have giant hands, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is exclusively a two-handed phone. But I’d argue that there are always times when you need to use a phone one-handed: public transport, carrying a bag, taking a selfie and so on.

The 6.5in Super Retina XDR “Pro level” OLED screen is just as wonderful as the one on the smaller iPhone 11 Pro, although it isn’t a massive leap over that fitted to significantly cheaper rivals such as the OnePlus 7 Pro. Flip it over and the frosted, almost metallic-like glass and square camera lump with three lenses poking out is new.

The iPhone 11 Pro Max has the same A13 Bionic chip, 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage as the rest of the iPhone 11 line, and performs similarly. Everything happens promptly, including intensive tasks such as video editing and gaming, and it should be a top performer for years to come.

The use of Lightning over the newer, more adaptable and useful USB-C is disappointing, as is the 64GB of starting storage. If you want to use your massive phone screen to watch video or play games, or you shoot any number of photos or 4K videos, you’re going to fill that up in no time.

Apple says it has managed to make the iPhone 11 Pro last five hours longer between charges than the iPhone XS Max, which managed 27 hours in my testing.

The iPhone 11 Pro Max beats that estimate by some margin, lasting just minutes shy of a full 48 hours between charges. That means the phone lasts from 7am on day one until about 6.50am on day three, propelling the iPhone 11 Pro Max into the two-day battery club previously only populated by a variety of Huawei’s top phones.

That was after the iOS 13.1.2 update, while using it as my primary device without a smartwatch attached, sending and receiving 100 emails and messages, 80 push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.

The iPhone 11 Pro Max ships with an 18W USB-C fast charger and a USB-C to Lightning cable in the box. A full charge from flat took two hours 20 minutes, but hit 50% in 31 minutes and 70% in 46 minutes, slowing charging to a trickle above 95%.

The phone also gets pretty hot when fast charging. It can wirelessly charge too, but can’t charge other devices.

It’s also worth noting that iOS 13 includes a battery optimisation feature, which is designed to learn your habits and only charge the battery past 80% when it thinks you need it to extend its longevity.

The iPhone 11 Pro shipped with iOS 13 but was quickly updated three times to iOS 13.1.2, following the same issues suffered with the iPhone 11.

Dark mode, swipe typing on the Apple keyboard, improved quick setting access and menstrual cycle tracking are all new highlights of iOS 13.

The iPhone 11 Pro Max also has a few additions for the large screen such as a split-screen view in Mail, Calendar, Messages and others that aren’t present on the smaller iPhone 11 Pro. It also supports a few tricks to help with one-handed use such as bringing the top of the screen down or moving the keyboard to one of the sides, which itself is difficult to do with your right hand as the button to activate it is in the bottom left corner of the screen.

It’s the back gesture, which is a swipe in from the left edge of the screen, that’s a killer for a right-handed user. Trying to do that with one hand is equal parts frustration and dread.

Apple leads the industry in software updates, providing at least five years of support from release, where other manufacturers cap out at about three years, and has recently shown a surprising ability to rapidly push out bug fix updates in quick succession.

The iPhone 11 Pro Max has Apple’s new triple 12-megapixel camera setup – the same as the smaller iPhone 11 Pro. The combination of ultrawide, wide and telephoto cameras gives you the ability to shoot at 0.5x, 1x or 2x optical zoom, then up to 10x digital zoom.

Overall, it’s a massive step up on previous iPhone cameras, and better still than the cheaper iPhone 11. Apple’s new night mode brings it up to par with the best rivals on very low-light photography, while the new deep fusion technology rolling out with iOS 13.2 is getting closer than ever to the clarity of fine detail of an SLR with a large lens.

The photos used for this review were all shot on an iPhone 11 Pro running iOS 13.2 beta.

After lagging the ultra-competitive camera competition for some time, Apple is firmly up with the best with the iPhone 11 Pro line.
• None The iPhone 11 Pro Max is water resistant to IP68 standards of up to 4m for 30 minutes – which is 2m deeper last year’s iPhone XS Max
• None Bluetooth performance is much improved, with stronger connections to even the weakest of headphones
• None Face ID is still best-in-class, now slightly faster and working at slightly wider angles
• None The new U1 chip enables enhanced location abilities, but so far it’s only used for directional AirDrop file sharing
• None The highly polished stainless steel is easy to mark and dull in even careful general use
• None The pressure sensitive screen of previous iPhones is gone and with it 3D Touch, so you can’t press harder on things any more

The iPhone 11 Pro Max costs £1,149 for 64GB of storage, £1,299 for 256GB or £1,499 for 512GB in black, green, silver or gold.

For comparison, the iPhone 11 Pro costs £1,049, the iPhone 11 costs £729 and the iPhone XR costs £629.

The OnePlus 7 costs £499, the Samsung Galaxy S10 costs £799 and the Huawei P30 Pro costs £799.

There’s an excellent super-sized smartphone within Apple’s grasp, but unfortunately the iPhone 11 Pro Max isn’t it.

A design that works at the much smaller size of the 5.8in iPhone 11 Pro simply doesn’t at the gargantuan 6.5in iPhone 11 Pro Max, meaning Apple’s biggest phone suffers from terrible ergonomics.

I get that uniformity is Apple’s schtick, but in this case it actively makes the product worse. Of all the massive phones I’ve used across the years, the heavy, slippery iPhone 11 Pro Max and iPhone XS Max before it are the only ones to give me serious hand pain. It’s literally a crying shame, because everything else about it – from the camera, the screen and the performance – is great.

When it comes down to it, only the genuinely epic Huawei-level battery life salvages the iPhone 11 Pro Max from being a three-star product, and even then this is a four-star phone that is extremely expensive.

There are certainly better, easier-to-use big-screen smartphones available that cost significantly less than the jaw-dropping £1,149 and up Apple wants for the iPhone 11 Pro Max.

But if you must have an iPhone and the wonderful 5.8in iPhone 11 Pro doesn’t quite cut it, do yourself a favour and save £420 and buy the 6.1in iPhone 11. Only those that genuinely need two-day battery life should buy the iPhone 11 Pro Max, and even then I wouldn’t.

14,Football,A-League 2019-20 season preview: team-by-team guide,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/08/a-league-2019-20-season-preview-team-by-team-guide,2019-10-07T17:00:56Z,"After a period of stagnation, the A-League has set rancorous in-fighting over governance behind it and welcomed a first new club to the mix since 2012-13. A lack of marketing fanfare may have engendered a “soft launch” feel but with the winter codes finished things should quickly heat up. Western United will energise Melbourne fans, while the arrival of Robbie Fowler in Queensland could be the biggest thing to unite Brisbane since the Story Bridge.

Adelaide should be there or thereabouts again this campaign but the continued lack of quality options in the final third means new coach Gertjan Verbeek’s solid squad may struggle to last the course.

Verbeek has the firm foundations laid by Marco Kurz to build on during his first taste of the A-League. Under their former boss United were solid defensively and hardworking around the ground, but they lacked a cutting edge up front. That problem does not appear to have been rectified conclusively in the transfer window, and not helped by the departure of Craig Goodwin, last season’s top scorer. Even more significantly the Reds have lost their on-field talisman Isaias, one of the most influential leaders in the league during his six-year stint in South Australia.

The list of recruits is short with Michaël Maria and Kristian Opseth headlining the international signings, while Riley McGree’s return ensures the Reds boast one of the country’s brightest midfield prospects.

In the short-term, a home FFA Cup final could provide an early season boost. Looking further down the track, the decision to bring former stars Bruce Djite, Carl Veart and Eugene Galekovic into the fold suggests the club’s football department is in safe hands. (JP)

It’s hard to know exactly what to expect from Brisbane Roar. After an utterly abject 2018-19 the club has undergone wholesale change – a clean broom through the dressing room and the backroom too, with the well-known but simultaneously unknown “marquee manager” Robbie Fowler taking the reins. It could go spectacularly right. It could also go incredibly wrong.

In the positives column they have snaffled a proven A-League goalscorer. With 39 goals in 78 A-League starts, Roy O’Donovan is your literal one-in-two striker every team craves. Moreover, he could prove the perfect foil for rising star Dylan Wenzel-Halls, the unequivocal bright light amid last season’s drudgery. In midfield especially, Roar look solid. Aidan O’Neill was the diamond in Central Coast’s 2019-20 roughery, Brad Inman and George Mells could prove handy, while after an injury-ravaged last season Stefan Mauk is as good as a new signing.

The massive variable is Fowler’s foreign legion. Centre-back Tom Aldred has been handed the armband so should be sound, and if Aaron Amadi-Holloway, Macauley Gillesphey and Jay O’Shea fire, this team could be very competitive. If they flop though, it could be one of the worst collective use of visa spots the league has seen. On top of all this, the Bakries remain. Let’s hope off-field dysfunction won’t hinder on-field performance; again. (RP)

Almost rivalling Brisbane in the “clean broom” off-season stakes, Central Coast have put behind them one of the worst seasons in A-League history with player, coach and agent disruptions making 2018-19 a train wreck for the faithful. Coach Alen Stajcic put aside his own tumultuous year to steady the ship; now we find out whether his off-season recruitment and pre-season planning have been up to scratch to make the Mariners competitive once again.

Mark Birighitti is a massive in. They either do keepers brilliantly or awfully in Gosford, and the one-time Premier League signing could prove to be worth at least five to 10 points. The prodigiously talented Danny De Silva needs to stamp his mark on the A-League. This is the season to do it. While Giancarlo Gallifuoco, Dylan Fox and Sam Silvera are talented locals who could blossom with regular football.

Ziggy Gordon, Milan Duric and Kim Eun-sun bring much-needed experience, but there’s still the feeling this squad is desperately short up-front. Matt Simon, Jordan Murray and Tommy Oar boasted seven goals between them last season from open play. If they struggle again, it could be another long, long season on the Coast. (RP)

The revolving door at Melbourne City has been spinning furiously since the end of last season with players, coaches and backroom staff coming and going at a rate of knots. This means City begin the new campaign as something of an unknown quantity with a remodelled squad under the guidance of a new gaffer, Erick Mombaerts.

The run to the FFA Cup final has confirmed Jamie Maclaren remains a goalscoring certainty at this level, and that Craig Noone looks among the highest quality signings of the offseason. More broadly, there should be real excitement at the potential minutes afforded to City’s rich crop of young Australians. Connor Metcalfe has been pencilled in as Josh Brillante’s midfield partner while Ramy Najjarine, Nathaniel Atkinson, Denis Genreau and others should all further their development.

Arguably City’s biggest task lies off-field. Last season was a disaster with fans voicing their discontent with the club’s hierarchy. With a new coach and a squad full of youthful promise, this is a golden opportunity for the City Football Group to demonstrate the merits of its ownership model, and bring a community along with them for the ride. (JP)

For the first time in A-League history Melbourne Victory go into a season without Kevin Muscat’s fingerprints on the team as either a player or coach. That reflects a broader reset with the core of last year’s first XI also moving on to new pastures.

But that doesn’t mean a drop in expectations at the competition’s standard bearers. Proven A-League quality in the form of Andrew Nabbout, Robbie Kruse and Adama Traore have returned to the club, but it is Victory’s visa players that will hold the key to immediate success for new coach Marco Kurz. Kristijan Dobras, Migjen Basha, and Jakob Poulsen will be expected to combine in midfield and provide the ammunition for new skipper Ola Toivonen.

We know from his time at Adelaide that Kurz can organise a defence and with greater attacking talent at his disposal a much-changed Victory should once again be a force to be reckoned with. (JP)

There is reason to be worried about Newcastle Jets this season. Roy O’Donovan has flown the coop, Daniel Georgievski and Ronnie Vargas are massive outs, and even rising talent Joey Champness reckons his future is on the mic.

Dimi Petratos could cut an increasingly forlorn attacking presence upfront – especially with the news that star recruit Wes Hoolahan could be out for the best part of half a season due to injury. The ever-wily Merrick may have a late transfer up his sleeve, but there’s a lurking suspicion with a few loan deals and free transfers the only business done so far that owner Martin Lee’s precarious financial situation might limit the veteran coach’s options.

The back seven will remain relatively solid, but the front four remain a huge concern. Let’s hope Abdiel Arroyo can bring Pana-mania to the A-League, not seen since his similarly alliterative countryman Yairo Yau. Otherwise beating the Mariners might be the only joy for the faithful this campaign. (RP)

Last season’s premiers boast a squad full of depth and character, a first XI to rival anybody’s, and a coach with a proven winning formula. Perth Glory will be near the top again in 2019-20.

It’s a testament to the Glory administration that departures as potentially painful as Andy Keogh and Jason Davidson have been salved by the recruitment of Bruno Fornaroli and James Meredith, while the loss of Shane Lowry simply means more minutes for Tomi Mrcela.

The Asian Champions League campaign could throw a spanner in the works after Christmas, especially with a squad containing so many players nearer the end of their careers than the start, but that’s nit-picking for a side that displays no obvious weak links, be it in personnel or tactics. (JP)

A picture of quiet rejuvenation the last three seasons, Sydney FC have been the most consistent in their recruitment, and despite a few big name outs, the business they’ve done has not only improved the squad, but been a finger in the eye to several of their rivals.

Retiring skipper Alex Brosque was always going to leave a hole, but with the signings of Kosta Barbarouses and Alexander Baumjohann they’ve more than able replaced the 35-year-old, as well as the injured-plagued Siem De Jong. Moreover, they’ve also already lit the sky blue touchpaper on the Sydney derby and the Big Blue – look forward to those.

Josh Brillante for Luke Brattan is a high pedigree trade, while the return to Australia of Ryan McGowan is more than a handy replacement for last season’s rare flop, Dutchman Jop van der Linden. With the back office stable and the academy starting to produce consistent young talent, it bodes as another good season for Sydney. And that’s before you even mention Miloš Ninković and Adam Le Fondre. (RP)

Nobody gave Mark Rudan’s rag-tag gang much of a chance last season; nobody will fancy his good friend Ufuk Talay’s mob this season either. And yet across the ditch there’s a quiet confidence to Phoenix’s off-season recruitment. Matti Steinmann and Ulises Davila come with a pedigree that could take the league by storm, while David Ball is the kind of hardworking striker that thrives in the A-League.

And yet. There’s one cavern-sized hole the Phoenix haven’t – and in truth – might never replace: Roy Krishna. A genuine x-factor, the Johnny Warren medallist could single-handedly turn a contest. Take out David Williams, the mercurial Sarpreet Singh, Max Burgess and the best keeper in the league, Filip Kurto, and last season’s heroics may be hard to repeat.

Australian fans may not be familiar with Stefan Marinovic, but the All Whites keeper is the real deal. If fit, Luke DeVere could form a tough-as-teak centre pairing with new skipper Steven Taylor, while Callum McCowatt and Reno Piscopo are genuine talents. A marquee striker is allegedly on his way: fingers crossed for that. They’re down 35 goals from Krishna, Williams and Singh – they’ll have to come from somewhere. (RP)

Markus Babbel has overhauled the squad that so disappointed during his debut season as coach ahead of a decisive campaign for Western Sydney Wanderers. After three years without a home the Wanderers can finally enjoy the spectacular Bankwest Arena and with it the raucous home support that provided the soundtrack to the club’s early successes – that is if Babbel can entice fans back after poor form and unsatisfactory temporary homes drove plenty away.

Recruitment had to focus on defence and in Daniel Lopar, Daniel Georgievski, Matt Jurman and Dylan McGowan dramatic improvements have been made, while Pirmin Schwegler offers the experienced foil the promising Keanu Baccus requires to flourish in the centre of midfield. In contrast to last season, Babbel’s headaches may now come in the final third following the departure of Alex Baumjohann and the long-term injury to his replacement Radosław Majewski robbing him of an obvious playmaker. Nonetheless, a much stronger Wanderers – and a push for the finals – must be expected. (JP)

The A-League’s newest club have nothing to lose in their opening campaign, and their mere presence has put a spring in the step of the football community. Their true potential will not be realised until their standalone stadium has been built, but there are grounds for optimism before then.

Under the direction of Steve Horvat and Lou Sticca, Western United have snapped up the most impressive young Australian manager going around and handed him a squad with the building blocks for immediate results. There’s experience and character in the likes of Andrew Durante, Ersan Gülüm and Scott McDonald, international class in the shape of Alessandro Diamanti and Panagiotis Kone, proven A-League quality in Filip Kurto, Josh Risdon and Besart Berisha, and a sprinkling of exciting youngsters with Seb Pasquali, Dylan Pierias and Apostolos Stamatelopoulos all stars in the making.

Ups and downs are inevitable in a debut season, but on paper at least Western United have the raw materials to hold their own from the get-go. (JP)",0.9995,
15,Technology,iPhone 11 Pro review: the best small phone available,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/07/iphone-11-pro-the-best-small-phone-available,2019-10-07T06:00:43Z,"Apple’s iPhone has gone “pro” for its 11th iteration, with dramatically improved cameras and longer battery life, which make the smaller iPhone 11 Pro the king of more manageable phones.

Costing from £1,049 the iPhone 11 Pro is one of a rare breed: a premium flagship smartphone that doesn’t have a ginormous screen and is therefore small by today’s standards.

Everything is relative, of course. The iPhone 11 Pro’s 5.8in screen is considerably larger than the 4in iPhone SE, but compared with the monsters of the modern smartphone era with their 6.5in-plus screens the iPhone 11 Pro is positively pocketable.

The iPhone 11 Pro is essentially the same on the outside as the mould-breaking iPhone X from 2017, with a stainless steel and glass body, Face ID notch and 5.8in screen.

The new phone is 0.4mm taller, 0.5mm wider, 0.4mm thicker and 11g heavier than the iPhone XS that came before it, but you’d be very hard pressed to tell, even side-by-side. While the 188g weight is fairly heavy compared with rivals, the rest of the dimensions compare favourably, making the iPhone 11 Pro one of the easiest of devices to pocket, hold and use with one hand.

Apple’s Super Retina XDR “Pro level” OLED screen is new for this year and is considerably brighter during regular usage and when displaying Dolby Vision or HDR10 content.

It’s a gorgeous display. Sharp, bright, colour-rich and full of contrast. At 60Hz it isn’t quite as smooth a screen as the 90Hz display on the OnePlus 7 Pro, but it wins on all other counts against everything else, particularly at this size.

Flip the phone over and you will see a new frosted glass back, which is more grippy when the phone and your hands are cold, but less so than the previous glossy coating when both are warm. The camera lump is now a square raised glass section in the top right with three cameras arranged in a triangle. If you suffer from trypophobia (that’s an aversion to clusters of small holes) the iPhone 11 Pro is definitely not for you.

The iPhone 11 Pro has the same A13 Bionic chip, 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage as the rest of the iPhone 11 line, and performs similarly. Everything happens promptly, including intensive tasks such as video editing and gaming.

The iPhone 11 Pro will handle everything you need now, and will likely be a top performer for years to come. There are two small disappointments, however. Despite being “Pro” the new phone still uses the old Lightning connector for charging, not the much more powerful and adaptable USB-C to which Apple switched all its MacBook laptops and the recent iPad Pro.

The starting storage of 64GB is also disappointing. For anyone shooting any amount of 4K video you’ll very quickly fill 64GB, and even if you’re not a “pro” creative, then apps, games and movies will make short work of the space.

Apple says that it’s managed to make the iPhone 11 Pro last four hours longer between charges than the iPhone XS, which only just managed 24 hours in my testing – which itself was worse than the iPhone X at 30 hours.

I’m pleased to report that the iPhone 11 Pro beats Apple’s estimates and lasts eight hours longer than the iPhone XS, at just shy of 32 hours. It will get me from 7am on day one until almost 4pm on day two. Attaching an Apple Watch Series 5 made negligible difference to the battery life of the iPhone too.

That was after the iOS 13.1.2 update, while using it as my primary device without a smartwatch attached, sending and receiving 150 emails and messages, 80 push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.

The iPhone 11 Pro is the first Apple smartphone to ship with an 18W USB-C fast charger and a USB-C to Lightning cable in the box. A full charge from flat took just over two hours 10 minutes, but a 50% charge was reached in 28 minutes and 70% in 43 minutes. As with the iPhone 11, Apple is clearly slowing charging to a trickle above 95%, meaning that charging much beyond 90% unless you need it probably isn’t worth it.

The phone also gets pretty hot when fast charging. It can wirelessly charge too, but can’t charge other devices.

It’s also worth noting that iOS 13 includes a battery optimising feature, which is designed to learn your habits and only charge the battery past 80% when it thinks you need it to extend its longevity.

The iPhone 11 Pro shipped with iOS 13 but was quickly updated three times to iOS 13.1.2, following the same issues suffered with the iPhone 11.

The big new features for iOS 13 are dark mode, which switches the interface a predominately black or dark background with white text. Dark mode theoretically has a battery benefit for the iPhone 11 Pro thanks to the OLED screen, which only consumes electricity for pixels that aren’t black, making white text on a predominantly black background more power efficient than black on white. But you’ll only see a meaningful benefit if the background is truly black and not a dark shade of grey.

Other highlights include the ability to swipe-type on the default keyboard, a long-press on control centre buttons now opens up quick connect menus for Bluetooth or wifi, as well as quickly jumping to the settings app. Photos now has an improved view of all your photos. You can silence unknown and spam callers, while location permissions for apps have been improved and there’s menstrual cycle and headphone audio level tracking in the Health app, which also now has a new more useful summary view.

Apple leads the industry in software updates, providing at least five years of support from release, where other manufacturers cap out at about three years, and has recently shown a surprising ability to rapidly push out bug-fix updates in quick succession.

The iPhone 11 Pro has Apple’s first triple 12-megapixel camera setup. It has the same normal and 2x telephoto configuration as previous models, but adds the new ultrawide camera from the iPhone 11.

The combination gives you the ability to shoot at 0.5x, 1x or 2x optical zoom then up to 10x digital zoom.

Apple calls this a “pro camera system” and like the dual-camera system fitted to the iPhone 11, it is a noticeable step up from last year, producing some of the best images I’ve had the pleasure to shoot across a range of different lighting conditions.

Apple’s new night mode brings the iPhone 11 Pro up to par with the gold-standard of Google’s Pixel 3 in very low-light photography, but note that it only operates on the main camera not the ultrawide or telephoto.

The automatic mode takes multiple frames between one and three seconds when handheld, depending on available light and how much you’re shaking the phone. Stick it on a tripod and you can set it to up to 30 seconds, which is best illustrated with starry sky shots - something I couldn’t test in dank, rainy Britain.

Smart HDR has been improved in bright lighting conditions too, producing well controlled highlights with detail in both shadow and bright spots. Images are slightly less flat and more dramatic than the XS last year too, which is a good thing.

The deep fusion technology, which will be enabled on the iPhone 11 series with iOS 13.2 (tested in beta for this review), also made a huge difference in fine detail particularly in middling light. For the first time with any smartphone, including the Pixel 3, we’re approaching the level of sharpness and clarity at full crop that only a proper camera with a large lens has managed in the past.

Video capture from the rear camera is fantastic, arguably the best in the business, including 4K at 60 frames per second. With a third-party app you can also shoot from more than one of the cameras at once, which might be useful for filmmakers, but I can’t ever see myself needing to do that.

The selfie camera is also improved, bumped to 12-megapixels and capable of capturing an almost terrifying level of detail in good lighting. The front-facing camera can also do slow motion selfies, which kids and big kids will love.

Overall the camera on the iPhone 11 Pro is a big step up, levelling to or exceeding rivals from the first half of 2019 in the most important features.
• None The iPhone 11 Pro is water resistant to IP68 standards of up to 4 metres for 30 minutes, which is 2 metres deeper than last year’s iPhone XS
• None Bluetooth performance is much improved, with stronger connections to even the weakest of headphones
• None Face ID is still best-in-class, now slightly faster and working at slightly wider angles
• None The new U1 chip enables enhanced location abilities, but so far it’s used only for directional AirDrop file sharing
• None The highly polished stainless steel is easy to mark and dull after even careful general use
• None The pressure sensitive screen of previous iPhones is gone and with it 3D Touch, so you can’t press harder on things anymore

The iPhone 11 Pro costs £1,049 for 64GB of storage, £1,199 for 256GB or £1,399 for 512GB in black, green, silver or gold.

For comparison, the iPhone 11 Pro Max costs £1,149, the iPhone 11 costs £729, the iPhone XR costs £629, the OnePlus 7 costs £499, the Samsung Galaxy S10 costs £799 and the Huawei P30 Pro costs £799.

After a misstep last year, Apple is back on top with what is simply the best smaller phone available. The iPhone 11 Pro has longer battery life, a better screen and excellent performance all round.

The camera is also a big improvement in terms of clarity and performance, particularly in fine detail and very low light, with the added night mode now matching rivals. It won’t yet replace a digital SLR for my professional photography, but it’s closer than anything there has been before.

The design is still a winner at this size, but is starting to look a little dated three years on from the mould-breaking iPhone X. And there’s no 5G to be seen either, when we’re right on the cusp of it being a key differentiator for 2020.

It’s not perfect, but in the sea of ever-larger, hand-stretching phones, it’s refreshing to have a model that’s comparatively easy to pocket, hold and use one-handed that doesn’t compromise on power or features.

The biggest issue with the iPhone 11 Pro is its price. The starting cost of £1,049 comes with only 64GB of storage, meaning you will likely have to rely heavily on cloud storage if you shoot a large number of photos, videos or download apps or movies.

I won’t pretend the iPhone 11 Pro is even remotely good value, because it’s not. Even if you do get five years of software support. For £1,049 and up you’re buying a product that is unrivalled at this size and paying a hefty premium price for the privilege.

16,Technology,'We are hurtling towards a surveillance state’: the rise of facial recognition technology,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/05/facial-recognition-technology-hurtling-towards-surveillance-state,2019-10-05T09:00:43Z,"Gordon’s wine bar is reached through a discreet side-door, a few paces from the slipstream of London theatregoers and suited professionals powering towards their evening train. A steep staircase plunges visitors into a dimly lit cavern, lined with dusty champagne bottles and faded newspaper clippings, which appears to have had only minor refurbishment since it opened in 1890. “If Miss Havisham was in the licensing trade,” an Evening Standard review once suggested, “this could have been the result.”

The bar’s Dickensian gloom is a selling point for people embarking on affairs, and actors or politicians wanting a quiet drink – but also for pickpockets. When Simon Gordon took over the family business in the early 2000s, he would spend hours scrutinising the faces of the people who haunted his CCTV footage. “There was one guy who I almost felt I knew,” he says. “He used to come down here the whole time and steal.” The man vanished for a six-month stretch, but then reappeared, chubbier, apparently after a stint in jail. When two of Gordon’s friends visited the bar for lunch and both had their wallets pinched in his presence, he decided to take matters into his own hands. “The police did nothing about it,” he says. “It really annoyed me.”

Gordon is in his early 60s, with sandy hair and a glowing tan that hints at regular visits to Italian vineyards. He makes an unlikely tech entrepreneur, but his frustration spurred him to launch Facewatch, a fast-track crime-reporting platform that allows clients (shops, hotels, casinos) to upload an incident report and CCTV clips to the police. Two years ago, when facial recognition technology was becoming widely available, the business pivoted from simply reporting into active crime deterrence. Nick Fisher, a former retail executive, was appointed Facewatch CEO; Gordon is its chairman.

Gordon installed a £3,000 camera system at the entrance to the bar and, using off-the-shelf software to carry out facial recognition analysis, began collating a private watchlist of people he had observed stealing, being aggressive or causing damage. Almost overnight, the pickpockets vanished, possibly put off by a warning at the entrance that the cameras are in use.

The company has since rolled out the service to at least 15 “household name retailers”, which can upload photographs of people suspected of shoplifting, or other crimes, to a centralised rogues’ gallery in the cloud. Facewatch provides subscribers with a high-resolution camera that can be mounted at the entrance to their premises, capturing the faces of everyone who walks in. These images are sent to a computer, which extracts biometric information and compares it to faces in the database. If there’s a close match, the shop or bar manager receives a ping on their mobile phone, allowing them to monitor the target or ask them to leave; otherwise, the biometric data is discarded. It’s a process that takes seconds.

Facewatch HQ is around the corner from Gordon’s, brightly lit and furnished like a tech company. Fisher invites me to approach a fisheye CCTV camera mounted at face height on the office wall; he reassures me that I won’t be entered on to the watchlist. The camera captures a thumbnail photo of my face, which is beamed to an “edge box” (a sophisticated computer) and converted into a string of numbers. My biometric data is then compared with that of the faces on the watchlist. I am not a match: “It has no history of you,” Fisher explains. However, when he walks in front of the camera, his phone pings almost instantly, as his face is matched to a seven-year-old photo that he has saved in a test watchlist.

“If you’re not a subject of interest, we don’t store any images,” Fisher says. “The argument that you walk in front of a facial recognition camera, and it gets stored and you get tracked is just.” He pauses. “It depends who’s using it.”

While researching theft prevention, Fisher consulted a career criminal from Leeds who told him that, for people in his line of work, “the holy grail is, don’t get recognised”. This, he says, makes Facewatch the ultimate deterrent. He tells me he has signed a deal with a major UK supermarket chain (he won’t reveal which) and is set to roll out the system across their stores this autumn. On a conservative estimate, Fisher says, Facewatch will have 5,000 cameras across the UK by 2022.

The company also has a contract with the Brazilian police, who have used the platform in Rio de Janeiro. “We caught the number two on Interpol’s most-wanted South America list, a drug baron,” says Fisher, who adds the system also led to the capture of a male murderer who had been on the run for several years, spotted dressed as a woman at the Rio carnival. I ask him whether people are right to be concerned about the potential of facial recognition to erode personal privacy. “My view is that, if you’ve got something to be worried about, you should probably be worried,” he says. “If it’s used proportionately and responsibly, it’s probably one of the safest technologies today.”

Unsurprisingly, not everyone sees things this way. In the past year, as the use of facial recognition technology by police and private companies has increased, the debate has intensified over the threat it could pose to personal privacy and marginalised groups.

The cameras have been tested by the Metropolitan police at Notting Hill carnival, a Remembrance Sunday commemoration, and at the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London. This summer, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, wrote to the owners of a private development in King’s Cross, demanding more information after it emerged that facial recognition had been deployed there for unknown purposes.

In May, Ed Bridges, a public affairs manager at Cardiff University, launched a landmark legal case against South Wales police. He had noticed facial recognition cameras in use while Christmas shopping in Cardiff city centre in 2018. Bridges was troubled by the intrusion. “It was only when I got close enough to the van to read the words ‘facial recognition technology’ that I realised what it was, by which time I would’ve already had my data captured and processed,” he says. When he noticed the cameras again a few months later, at a peaceful protest in Cardiff against the arms trade, he was even more concerned: it felt like an infringement of privacy, designed to deter people from protesting. South Wales police have been using the technology since 2017, often at major sporting and music events, to spot people suspected of crimes, and other “persons of interest”. Their most recent deployment, in September, was at the Elvis Festival in Porthcawl.

“I didn’t wake up one morning and think, ‘I want to take my local police to court’,” Bridges says. “The objection I had was over the way they were using the technology. The police in this country police by consent. This undermines trust in them.”

During a three-day hearing, lawyers for Bridge, supported by the human rights group Liberty, alleged the surveillance operation breached data protection and equality laws. But last month, Cardiff’s high court ruled that the trial, backed by £2m from the Home Office, had been lawful. Bridges is appealing, but South Wales police are pushing forward with a new trial of a facial recognition app on officers’ mobile phones. The force says it will enable officers to confirm the identity of a suspect “almost instantaneously, even if that suspect provides false or misleading details, thus securing their quick arrest”.

The Metropolitan police have also been the subject of a judicial review by the privacy group Big Brother Watch and the Green peer Jenny Jones, who discovered that her own picture was held on a police database of “domestic extremists”.

In contrast with DNA and fingerprint data, which normally have to be destroyed within a certain time period if individuals are arrested or charged but not convicted, there are no specific rules in the UK on the retention of facial images. The Police National Database has snowballed to contain about 20m faces, of which a large proportion have never been charged or convicted of an offence. Unlike DNA and fingerprints, this data can also be acquired without a person’s knowledge or consent.

“I think there are really big legal questions,” says Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch. “The notion of doing biometric identity checks on millions of people to identify a handful of suspects is completely unprecedented. There is no legal basis to do that. It takes us hurtling down the road towards a much more expansive surveillance state.”

Some countries have embraced the potential of facial recognition. In China, which has about 200m surveillance cameras, it has become a major element of the Xue Liang (Sharp Eyes) programme, which ranks the trustworthiness of citizens and penalises or credits them accordingly. Cameras and checkpoints have been rolled out most intensively in the north-western Xinjiang province, where the Uighur people, a Muslim and minority ethnic group, account for nearly half the population. Face scanners at the entrances of shopping malls, mosques and at traffic crossings allow the government to cross-reference with photos on ID cards to track and control the movement of citizens and their access to phone and bank services.

At the other end of the spectrum, San Francisco became the first major US city to ban police and other agencies from using the technology in May this year, with supervisor Aaron Peskin saying: “We can have good policing without being a police state.”

Meanwhile, the UK government has faced harsh criticism from its own biometrics commissioner, Prof Paul Wiles, who said the technology is being rolled out in a “chaotic” fashion in the absence of any clear laws. Brexit has dominated the political agenda for the past three years; while politicians have looked the other way, more and more cameras are being allowed to look at us.

Facial recognition is not a new crime-fighting tool. In 1998, a system called FaceIt, comprising a handful of CCTV cameras linked to a computer, was rolled out to great fanfare by police in the east London borough of Newham. At one stage, it was credited with a 40% drop in crime. But these early systems only worked reliably in the lab. In 2002, a Guardian reporter tried in vain to get spotted by FaceIt after police agreed to add him to their watchlist. He compared the system to a fake burglar alarm on the front of a house: it cuts crime because people believe it works, not because it does.

However, in the past three years, the performance of facial recognition has stepped up dramatically. Independent tests by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (Nist) found the failure rate for finding a target picture in a database of 12m faces had dropped from 5% in 2010 to 0.1% this year.

The rapid acceleration is thanks, in part, to the goldmine of face images that have been uploaded to Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and captioned news articles in the past decade. At one time, scientists would create bespoke databases by laboriously photographing hundreds of volunteers at different angles, in different lighting conditions. By 2016, Microsoft had published a dataset, MS Celeb, with 10m face images of 100,000 people harvested from search engines – they included celebrities, broadcasters, business people and anyone with multiple tagged pictures that had been uploaded under a Creative Commons licence, allowing them to be used for research. The dataset was quietly deleted in June, after it emerged that it may have aided the development of software used by the Chinese state to control its Uighur population.

In parallel, hardware companies have developed a new generation of powerful processing chips, called Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), uniquely adapted to crunch through a colossal number of calculations every second. The combination of big data and GPUs paved the way for an entirely new approach to facial recognition, called deep learning, which is powering a wider AI revolution.

“The performance is just incredible,” says Maja Pantic, research director at Samsung AI Centre, Cambridge, and a pioneer in computer vision. “Deep [learning] solved some of the long-standing problems in object recognition, including face recognition.”

Recognising faces is something like a game of snap – only with millions of cards in play rather than the standard deck of 52. As a human, that skill feels intuitive, but it turns out that our brains perform this task in a surprisingly abstract and mathematical way, which computers are only now learning to emulate. The crux of the problem is this: if you’re only allowed to make a limited number of measurements of a face – 100, say – what do you choose to measure? Which facial landmarks differ most between people, and therefore give you the best shot at distinguishing faces?

A deep-learning program (sometimes referred to more ominously as an “agent”) solves this problem through trial and error. The first step is to give it a training data set, comprising pairs of faces that it tries to match. The program starts out by making random measurements (for example, the distance from ear to ear); its guesses will initially be little better than chance. But at each attempt, it gets feedback on whether it was right or wrong, meaning that over millions of iterations it figures out which facial measurements are the most useful. Once a program has worked out how to distil faces into a string of numbers, the algorithm is packaged up as software that can be sent out into the world, to look at faces it has never seen before.

The performance of facial recognition software varies significantly, but the most effective algorithms available, such as Microsoft’s, or NEC’s NeoFace, very rarely fail to match faces using a high-quality photograph. There is far less information, though, about the performance of these algorithms using images from CCTV cameras, which don’t always give a clear view.

Recent trials reveal some of technology’s real-world shortcomings. When South Wales police tried out their NeoFace system for 55 hours, 2,900 potential matches were flagged, of which 2,755 were false positives and just 18 led to arrests (the number charged was not disclosed). One woman on the watchlist was “spotted” 10 times – none of the sightings turned out to be of her. This led to claims that the software is woefully inaccurate; in fact, police had set the threshold for a match at 60%, meaning that faces do not have to be rated as that similar to be flagged up. This minimises the chance of a person of interest slipping through the net, but also makes a lot of false positives inevitable.

In general, Pantic says, the public overestimates the capabilities of facial recognition. In the absence of concrete details about the purpose of the surveillance in London’s King’s Cross this summer, newspapers speculated that the cameras could be tracking shoppers and storing their biometric data. Pantic dismisses this suggestion as “ridiculous”. Her own team has developed, as far as she is aware, the world’s leading algorithm for learning new faces, and it can only store the information from about 50 faces before it slows down and stops working. “It’s huge work,” she says. “People don’t understand how the technology works, and start spreading fear for no reason.”

This week, the Met police revealed that seven images of suspects and missing people had been supplied to the King’s Cross estate “to assist in the prevention of crime”, after earlier denying any involvement. Writing to the London Assembly, the deputy London mayor, Sophie Linden, said she “wanted to pass on the [Metropolitan police service’s] apology” for failing to previously disclose that the scheme existed, and announced that similar local image-sharing agreements were now banned. The police did not disclose whether any related arrests took place.

Like many of those working at the sharp end of AI, Pantic believes the controversy is “super overblown”. After all, she suggests, how seriously can we take people’s concerns when they willingly upload millions of pictures to Facebook and allow their mobile phone to track their location? “The real problem is the phones,” she says – a surprising statement from the head of Samsung’s AI lab. “You are constantly pushed to have location services on. [Tech companies] know where you are, who you are with, what you ate, what you spent, wherever you are on the Earth.”

Concerns have been raised that facial recognition has a diversity problem, after widely cited research by MIT and Stanford University found that software supplied by three companies misassigned gender in 21% to 35% of cases for darker-skinned women, compared with just 1% for light-skinned men. However, based on the top 20 algorithms, Nist found that there is an average difference of just 0.3% in accuracy between performance for men, women, light- and dark-skinned faces. Even so, says Carlo of Big Brother Watch, the technology’s impact could still be discriminatory because of where it is deployed and whose biometric data ends up on databases. It’s troubling, she says, that for two years, Notting Hill carnival, the country’s largest celebration of Caribbean and black British culture, was seen as an “acceptable testing ground” for the technology.

I ask Fisher about the risk of racial profiling: the charge that some groups may be more likely to fall under suspicion, say, when a shop owner is faced with ambiguous security footage. He dismisses the concern. Facewatch clients are required to record the justification for their decision to upload a picture on to the watchlist and, in a worst-case scenario, he argues, a blameless individual might be approached by a shopkeeper, not thrown into jail. “You’re talking about human prejudices, you can’t blame the technology for that,” he says.

After our interview, I email several times to ask for a demographic breakdown of the people on the watchlist, which Fisher had offered to provide; Facewatch declines.

Bhuwan Ribhu grew up in Delhi, in a small apartment with his parents, his sister Asmita, and many children who had been rescued from slavery and exploitation. Like Gordon, Ribhu followed his parents into the family business – in his case, tracking down India’s missing children, who have been enticed, forcibly taken or sold by their parents to traffickers, and end up working in illegal factories, quarries, farms and brothels. His father is the Nobel Peace laureate Kailash Satyarthi, who founded the campaign Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save Childhood Movement) in 1980, after realising that he could not accommodate all of the children being rescued in the family home.

The scale of the challenge is almost incomprehensible: 63,407 child kidnappings were reported to Indian police in 2016, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Many children later resurface, but the sheer numbers involved mean it can take months or years to reunite them with their families. “About 300,000 children have gone missing over the last five or six years, and 100,000 children are housed in various childcare institutions,” says Ribhu. “For many of those, there is a parent out there looking for their child. But it is impossible to manually go through them all.”

He describes the case of Sonu, a boy from India’s rural Bihar region, 1,000km from Delhi. When Sonu was 13, his parents entrusted him to a factory owner who promised him a better life and money. But they quickly lost track of their son’s whereabouts and began to fear for his safety. Eventually they contacted Bachpan Bachao Andolan for help. Sonu was tracked down after about two years, hundreds of miles from home. “We found the child after sending out his photo to about 1,700 childcare institutions across India,” Ribhu says. “One of them called us back and said they might have the child. People went and physically verified it. We were looking for one child in a country of 1.3 billion.”

Ribhu had read a newspaper article about the use of facial recognition to identify terrorists at airports and realised it could help. India has created two centralised databases in recent years: one containing photos of missing children, and the other containing photos of children housed in childcare institutions. In April last year, a trial was launched to see whether facial recognition software could be used to match the identities of missing and found children in the Delhi region. The trial was quickly hailed a success, with international news reports suggesting that “nearly 3,000 children” had been identified within four days. This was an exaggeration: the 3,000 figure refers to potential matches flagged by the software, not verified identifications, and it proves difficult to find out how many children have been returned to parents. (The Ministry of Women and Child Development did not respond to questions.) But Ribhu says that, since being rolled out nationally in April, there have been 10,561 possible matches and the charity has “unofficial knowledge” of more than 800 of these having been verified. “It has already started making a difference,” he says. “For the parents whose child has been returned because of these efforts, for the parents whose child has not gone missing because the traffickers are in jail. We are using all the technological solutions available.”

Watching footage of Sonu being reunited with his parents in a recent documentary, The Price Of Free, it is hard to argue against the deployment of a technology that could have ended his ordeal more quickly. Nonetheless, some privacy activists say such successes are used to distract from a more open-ended surveillance agenda. In July, India’s Home Ministry put out a tender for a new Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) to help use real-time CCTV footage to identify missing children – but also criminals and others, by comparing the footage with a “watchlist” curated from police databases or other sources.

Real-time facial recognition, if combined with the world’s largest biometric database (known as Aadhaar), could create the “perfect Orwellian state”, according to Vidushi Marda, a legal researcher at the human rights campaign group Article 19. About 90% of the Indian population are enrolled in Aadhaar, which allocates people a 12-digit ID number to access government services, and requires the submission of a photograph, fingerprints and iris scans. Police do not currently have access to Aadhaar records, but some fear that this could change.

“If you say we’re finding missing children with a technology, it’s very difficult for anyone to say, ‘Don’t do it’,” Marda says. “But I think just rolling it out now is more dangerous than good.”

Debates about civil liberties are often dictated by instinct: ultimately, how much do you trust law enforcement and private companies to do the right thing? When searching for common ground, I notice that both sides frequently reference China as an undesirable endpoint. Fisher thinks that the recent disquiet about facial recognition stems from the paranoia people feel after reading about its deployment there. “They’ve created digital prisons using facial recognition technology. You can’t use your credit card, you can’t get a taxi, you can’t get a bus, your mobile phone stops working,” he says. “But that’s China. We’re not China.”

Groups such as Liberty and Big Brother Watch say the opposite: since facial recognition, by definition, requires every face in a crowd to be scanned to identify a single suspect, it will turn any country that adopts it into a police state. “China has made a strategic choice that these technologies will absolutely intrude on people’s liberty,” says biometrics commissioner Paul Wiles. “The decisions we make will decide the future of our social and political world.”

For now, it seems that the question of whether facial recognition will make us safer, or represents a new kind of unsafe, is being left largely to chance. “You can’t leave [this question] to people who want to use the technology,” Wiles says. “It shouldn’t be the owners of the space around King’s Cross, it shouldn’t be Facewatch, it shouldn’t be the police or ministers alone – it should be parliament.”

After leaving the Facewatch office, I walk along the terrace of Gordon’s, where a couple of lunchtime customers are enjoying a bottle of red in the sunshine, and past the fisheye lens at the entrance to the bar, which I now know is beaming my face to the computer cloud. I think back to a winky promise I’ve read on the Gordon’s website: “Make your way to the cellar to your rickety candlelit table – anonymity is guaranteed!”

Out in the wider world, anonymity is no longer guaranteed. Facial recognition gives police and companies the means of identifying and tracking people of interest, while others are free to go about their business. The real question is: who gets that privilege?

17,Technology,Microsoft launches Surface Pro X and previews folding phone,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/02/microsoft-launches-surface-pro-x-and-previews-folding-phone,2019-10-02T17:37:00Z,"Microsoft has launched the Surface Pro X, a redesigned thin and light two-in-one Windows 10 PC running on custom ARM chips rather than traditional Intel processors, plus the Surface Pro 7 and Surface Laptop 3, and previewed a folding phone and dual-screen tablet.

The products were unveiled at an event in New York on Wednesday, where Microsoft sought to grab attention from rivals including Apple and Samsung.

The Surface Pro X is Microsoft’s next-generation mobile tablet-laptop hybrid. It fits a larger high-resolution 13in screen into the 12in frame of the existing Surface Pro, is only 5.3mm thick at its thinnest point and weighs 762g. It retains the detachable Type Cover keyboard from Microsoft’s existing line, but introduces a new Surface Slim Pen stylus that fits between keyboard and tablet for charging and storage.

The biggest change is the use of the Microsoft SQ1 chip instead of Intel chips. The new custom ARM-based processor has an integrated AI engine and was developed with Qualcomm based on mobile device technology but running full Windows 10. Microsoft said the chip is three times more powerful per watt than the processor in the existing Surface Pro 6.

“What does that mean? Better battery life, faster, thinner, lighter with unprecedented performance, all while running the full power of Windows, Office, Edge and Chrome,” said Panos Panay, the chief product officer of Microsoft.

The new tablet PC also has always-connected 4G, similar to a smartphone, and promises battery life far in excess of traditional Intel computers.

The Surface Pro X will start at £999 in the UK and $999 in the US, where it will ship in early November.

Alongside the new ARM-powered Surface, Microsoft also announced an updated version of its traditional Windows tablet, the Surface Pro 7. It will use Intel’s 10th generation Core chips, making it more powerful than the outgoing Surface Pro 6. But the addition of USB-C connectivity to the tablet and a new fast-charging technology that will mean the battery can reach 80% in under an hour, are the biggest changes.

The Surface Pro 7 will cost from $749 in the US and will ship on 22 October. It will cost £799 in the UK.

Microsoft also unveiled updated traditional laptops with a refreshed 13.5in and brand new 15in Surface Laptop 3.

The 13.5in Surface Laptop 3 has a 20% larger trackpad, comes in either aluminium or Microsoft’s fabric Alcantara finish, and has USB-C for the first time. It also uses 10th-generation Intel Core chips, which Microsoft said are twice as fast as those found in the outgoing Surface Laptop 2 and three times more powerful than those found in Apple’s MacBook Air.

The larger 15in Surface Laptop 3 bucks the trend with options for an Ryzen Surface Edition processor made by Intel’s longtime rival AMD, which Microsoft said has the fastest graphics of any laptop in its class.

Geoff Blaber of analysts CCS Insight said: “Broadening its silicon partners to include AMD and Qualcomm will inevitably raise eyebrows and cause Intel to look over its shoulder.

“The reality is that this is about choice, control and flexibility as Microsoft widens the Surface portfolio to address a growing range of devices and use cases.”

Both laptops feature all-day battery life and Microsoft’s new fast-charging technology. They are also repairable, with removable hard drives and other components designed to be easily taken apart.

In a clear dig at rival Apple, which has had problems with its laptop keyboards that are difficult to repair, Panay said: “Being able to repair and service a product without impacting the beauty and elegance is critical. Serviceability, repairability, we did things so we can replace the screen or the keyboard without affecting the beauty.”

The 13in Surface Laptop 3 costs from $999 and the 15in version costs $1,199 in the US, shipping on 22 October. In the UK it will cost £999 and £1,199.

Microsoft also announced a new set of true wireless earbuds, called the Surface Earbuds, which are direct competitors to Apple’s AirPods and Samsung’s Galaxy Buds and join its existing Surface Headphones.

The Bluetooth earbuds feature one-clip pairing, multi-device compatibility – meaning they can be used with PCs, phones and tablets from all brands – and have up to 24-hour battery life with a charging case. A dual-mic array in each ear is designed to pick up the user’s voice and cancel the background noise, which was demoed though voice dictation in Office for real-time captions and translation.

They also have direct Spotify integration for starting playback without having to reach for the phone on Android, and gesture controls for playback and volume – something missing on many wireless earbuds.

The Surface Earbuds will cost $249 later this year in the US.

Alongside products due to go on sale this year, Microsoft also took the wraps off two products it is working on for Christmas 2020.

The Surface Duo is a two-screen folding phone, which has two 5.6in screens bolted together with a hinge that folds a full 360 degrees. The phone opens like a book then folds all the way round.

Microsoft pitched the Surface Duo as having the benefits of a phone, but also a computer on which you can do more because it has two screens. However, with folding devices such as Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, which have one continuous flexible screen that opens like a book instead of two screens bolted together, the Duo may be out of date before it ships.

Panay said the firm had partnered with Google to bring Android apps and the Play Store to the Duo, “bringing the absolute best of Microsoft with the absolute best of Google”.

“You’re more productive on two screens, much more than one screen can ever be, but it has to be elegant, it has to be robust,” he said, in a vague reference to Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, which has had problems with the robustness of its flexible screen.

Microsoft also unveiled the Surface Neo, which it said would be the evolution of its Surface computer line. It too has dual screens, with a hinge in the middle, but will run a new version of Microsoft’s operating system called Windows 10X.

The firm said the new device will have a detachable keyboard and can be opened like a book, used as two screens or one, used like a laptop with a virtual trackpad on one screen, or folded all the way over. It also supports the Surface Thin Pen, which attaches to the back of the device, and uses a new Intel chip designed to support dual-screen devices. The Surface Neo will be 5.6mm thick and weigh 655g.

“I believe this is the next category to adapt to you in form and function, creating unlimited and interrupted flow,” said Panay.

However, neither the Surface Duo or Neo will be available until Christmas 2020. More than a year is a long time in technology.

Blaber said: “Surface Duo is a bold new category of device and will take time to build developer and carrier support.

“The launch of Surface Duo will inevitably draw comparison with its doomed Windows Phone investments. Duo is not without risk, but Microsoft isn’t trying to repeat history and reinvent the wheel. It’s using an established platform to deliver a new category that is optimised for a Microsoft experience.

“This is the start of a journey for Microsoft and expectations should be set accordingly.”",0.9973,
18,Technology,iPhone 11 review: an iPhone XR with a better camera,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/01/iphone-11-review-iphone-xr-dual-camera-a13-smartphone,2019-10-01T06:00:39Z,"Apple’s lower cost model has latest chips and longer battery life but is identical on outside to predecessor

The iPhone 11 is Apple’s latest lower cost smartphone for 2019 that’s clearly aimed at a broader market, offering most of what its top phones do but for £320 less.

Costing from £729, the iPhone 11 is also £20 cheaper than last year’s iPhone XR was on launch – the phone it has now replaced.

In fact the iPhone 11 is identical on the outside to the iPhone XR in almost all the ways that matter. It’s the same size and weight. It’s got the same glass and aluminium design, same 6.1in LCD screen with rounded corners, the same large notch at the top and same thick bezels around the sides.

Flip it over and it’s got the same glass rear, except that “iPhone” is no longer written on the back and the Apple logo is positioned lower. The biggest difference is the new large, square camera lump in the top left corner, which on the iPhone 11 houses a new dual camera system.

The phone is well built, feeling extremely solid and it has the best LCD screen you’re likely to see on a phone although it isn’t as good-looking, colour rich, bright or high contrast as the OLED screens fitted to the iPhone 11 Pro or Apple’s many rivals costing £500 and up.

The iPhone 11 also suffers from the same disadvantages as the iPhone XR before it, namely it’s fairly heavy and wide with rounded edges that provide little in the way of grip. Compared to Samsung’s Galaxy S10, which has the same size 6.1in screen, the iPhone 11 is 5.3mm wider and 37g heavier and significantly harder to use one-handed.

The iPhone 11 shares the same core as the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max: Apple’s latest A13 Bionic chip, 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage. It’s the fastest and most efficient of Apple’s chips yet, but the reality is that it’s very difficult to tell. The iPhone 11 doesn’t feel any faster than last year’s iPhone XR/XS, or in fact the iPhone X in day-to-day usage.

That’s not surprising as Apple focuses its chips on doing the things you’d normally do more efficiently, with power to do something unusual if you need it. That means the iPhone 11 should still be a top-performer in two, three, maybe four years from now. So really the only thing you need to know is that the iPhone 11 will handle everything you are likely to do, and then some.

Apple also says that it’s managed to make the iPhone 11 last an hour longer than the iPhone XR, which lasted 32 hours between charges in my testing.

I’m happy to report that’s a bit of an underestimate. The iPhone 11 lasts closer to 35 hours between charges, which makes it the longest-lasting iPhone to have crossed my test bench, getting me from 7am though until 6pm the following day.

That was after the iOS 13.1.1 update, while using it as my primary device without a smartwatch attached, sending and receiving 150 emails and messages, 80 push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.

Charging the iPhone 11 with the included 5W charger is glacially slow, taking well over four hours to hit 100% from zero. Why Apple still ships a £729 phone with such a pathetic charger, I don’t know. With the £29 18W USB-C charger and £19 USB-C to Lightning cable that ships in the box with the iPhone 11 Pro, the iPhone 11 fully charged in just over 100 minutes, reaching 80% in well under and hour, which is more like it. Any USB-C power delivery chargers of 18W or higher will achieve the same results and can be had for one-third less.

It’s also worth noting that iOS 13 includes a battery optimising feature, which is designed to learn your habits and only charge the battery past 80% when it thinks you need it to extend its longevity. Apple is also clearly slowing charging down to a trickle above 95% regardless of charger, meaning that it’s probably not worth trying to charge it much beyond 90% if you don’t need to.

The iPhone 11 came out of the box with iOS 13 but was quickly updated to iOS 13.1 and then iOS 13.1.1, which was a good thing, as prior to the updates it was filled with bugs giving me all kinds of issues on three different iPhone 11 series phones.

First off, the camera confirmation for restoring it from another iPhone didn’t work. Then I was immediately stuck in a password-demand loop for an email account, which ended up with me having to hit the cancel button and then quickly enter one character of my 35-character password before the password demand popped back up blocking me from entering more. Hit cancel, rinse and repeat. Absolutely infuriating.

I had issues with location permissions getting stuck on “ask every time” for some apps. I also had several hard lockups of the phone prompting the three-button combo force restart procedure (up, down, hold power for ages), text in widgets and other areas was compressed and overlapping each other, and sometimes the camera failed to activate when launched.

Most of the problems have been solved since the update to iOS 13.1.1, and it even added an extra hour to my battery tests.

The big new features for iOS 13 are dark mode, which turns the interface from a predominately black text on white background to white text on a dark background, either manually or on a schedule.

You can now also long-press on control centre buttons such as Bluetooth or wifi, first to open a up more detail, then a second time to open up a quick connect menu as well as a button to take you straight to the appropriate place in the settings app for more extensive changes. It is a user-friendly feature that Android has had for years, so it’s good to finally see Apple catch up.

A few new privacy options are welcome, including the ability to silence unknown and spam callers and finer-grain location permissions. Menstrual cycle tracking is now integrated into the Health app alongside headphone audio level, and there’s a new summary view, which makes the app more friendly and useful at a glance.

It’s worth pointing out that Apple still provides the industry’s longest software support lifecycle of about five years from release where the best rivals cap out at about three years. It means you can safely use the phone for longer as you will continue to get important security updates as well as new features via iOS version updates.

The iPhone 11 has a new dual 12-megapixel camera on the back. Oddly you get an ultra-wide camera alongside a standard camera, not the more typical 2x optical zoom camera. That means you’ve effectively got 0.5x and 1x optical zoom then up to 5x digital zoom, which is good, but doesn’t hold a flame to real optical zoom.

Apple has significantly upped its game in the camera department this year, particularly in poor lighting conditions. Photos in good lighting conditions are some of the best on a smartphone, producing detail-rich and colour-accurate photos. The main camera is good, but the ultrawide is arguably the best in its class and is a lot of fun to shoot with.

Other than your typical ultra-wide vistas, you can also use the new camera to photograph more of a building or object you can’t get far enough away from to use the main camera.

Portrait mode is good too, and unlike on the XR can be used on more than just people. Apple’s smart HDR mode is also improved, producing images that are closer to class-leading Google Pixel cameras. But the biggest boost is Apple’s new night mode, which finally brings the iPhone’s very low-light performance up to scratch with the very best.

It’s not as fast as Huawei’s P30 Pro, which doesn’t need a special night mode to shoot similar photos, nor quite as dramatic as Google’s Pixel 3, but produces images that are often lighter and better controlled.

The automatic mode takes multiple frames between one and three seconds when handheld, depending on available light and how much you are shaking the phone. Stick it on a tripod and you can set it to 30 seconds, which is best illustrated with starry sky shots – something I couldn’t test in dank, rainy Britain.

The iPhone still struggles a little with indoor lighting where it’s not quite dark enough to benefit from night mode so produces images that are a little dark and lacking in detail. The selfie camera in particular produces somewhat grainy images here, but shoots great photos in better lighting conditions.

Video capture from the rear camera is fantastic, and easy to use, arguably better than rivals. The front-facing camera can also offers slow-motion selfies, which kids will love.

Overall the camera on the iPhone 11 is a big step up, equalling or exceeding rivals from the first half of 2019 in the most important features, although the lack of an optical zoom is disappointing.
• None The iPhone 11 is water resistant to IP68 standards of up to 2 metres for 30 seconds, which is 1 metre deeper than last year’s iPhone XR
• None Bluetooth performance is much improved, with stronger connections to even the weakest of headphones
• None The volume slider shows you a bespoke icon of the headphones you are wearing – if they are made by Apple
• None You can swipe to type on Apple’s default keyboard in iOS 13
• None Face ID is still best-in-class, now slightly faster and works at slightly wider angles
• None The new U1 chip enables enhanced location abilities, but so far it’s only used for directional AirDrop file sharing, which will be most useful for narrowing down which iPhone you want to send a file to in a cluster of iPhones – not something I do very often

The iPhone 11 costs £729 for 64GB of storage, £779 for 128GB or £879 for 256GB, and is available in white, black, green, yellow, purple or red.

For comparison, the iPhone XR costs £629, the OnePlus 7 costs £499, the Samsung S10e costs £669, the Honor 20 Pro costs £550, the iPhone 11 Pro costs £1,049 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max costs £1,149.

The iPhone 11 is an excellent but boring smartphone. It’s got a three-year-old design, which Apple broke the mould with in 2017 when it launched the iPhone X but now looks dated against the competition, particularly with the thicker bezels on the LCD screen. Things have moved on in the era of the all-screen smartphone.

It’s fairly large, heavy and difficult to grip and use with one hand, but is also extremely well made and feels solid. These are all attributes shared by its predecessor the iPhone XR, as the iPhone 11 is essentially new guts in last year’s design.

At £729 the iPhone 11 isn’t exactly cheap, costing the same as the top-of-the-line phones from competitors. But what you get for your £729 is Apple’s latest top-of-the-range processor with performance to match. Battery life that will easily see you into a second day, maybe a third if you’re careful. Camera performance that is up there with the very best, but lacking an optical zoom, replaced instead by a fun ultra-wide angle camera.

You also get five years of software updates, which can’t be sniffed at. With a battery swap at some point there’s no reason an iPhone 11 won’t last you five years if you’re careful with it. In some tests the glass appears fairly tough to break, but less so in others, so whether it will survive real-world drops remains to be seen.

So the iPhone 11 is the iPhone for people who don’t really care about smartphones and just want a new iPhone. Except that it’s not that simple. Apple still sells the iPhone XR, which is essentially the same phone minus a second camera and one year less of software support, which is still at least four years, for £100 less at £629. And then there’s the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max, which have a third camera, a significantly better screen and the cachet of being “the best iPhone”.

If your primary driver is to buy the best, cheapest iPhone you can get, that’s the iPhone XR in 2019. If you want the best iPhone you can get, that’s one of the new iPhone 11 Pro line. So where does that leave the iPhone 11?

19,Education,I returned to uni for freshers’ week 20 years after leaving. Here’s what has changed,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/30/i-returned-to-uni-for-freshers-week-20-years-after-leaving-heres-what-has-changed,2019-09-30T09:59:09Z,"In the autumn of 1997, I was a fresher at the University of Glasgow. Months after the Labour landslide, weeks after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, I was an 18-year-old British-Indian made up of equal parts teenage kicks, terror and Topshop – and on my way to Scotland for the first time, to live and study in a city I had never even visited. I was a 90s Londoner in every sense: geographically ignorant, cocky, earnestly carrying a pager. North, to me, meant north of the Thames. Yet there I was, on a train nosing true north on the west coast mainline.

At Euston station, I was waved off by my parents. I remember nothing of this momentous goodbye. In Carlisle, I felt a great sense of occasion because I thought we had crossed the border. By Motherwell, I was all grown up. In Glasgow, seeing the towering gothic spire of the fourth oldest university in the UK from my cab window, I thought it was the cathedral. When the driver informed me that it was, in fact, my university, I gasped. Had I even seen the prospectus?

Twenty-two years later, I am on another train. Forty years old, less cocky, the pager replaced by a scratched Samsung A5, but once more on my way to my alma mater – as no one in Glasgow calls it. This time, I am heading west from Edinburgh: I never did go back to England.

I am off to meet some freshers and do the things that freshers in 2019 do. Which is, according to my assumptions, drink less. Work more. Do more interacting on social media than freshers’-flu-inducing socialising. Worry about the financial burden of a degree, an unstable job market, rent hikes, epidemic levels of sexual harassment on UK campuses, climate crisis, Brexit and whatever fresh hell is playing out in Westminster. My abiding sense is of a generation of young people carrying a lot more on their young shoulders than mine did. Many have voted in neither a general election nor a referendum, yet find themselves living in the most turbulent period of British history since well before their parents were born.

On campus, at first glance, freshers’ week is as it ever was. Crazy busy, strewn with Domino’s branding (free pizza is being handed out at the main gate), soundtracked by tinny beats pumped out of who knows where, filled with a sea of friendly and daunted faces. The fashion, too, has come full circle: jeans, T-shirts, check shirts, trainers, a surfeit of blue- and pink-dyed hair. The front page of the university newspaper, the Glasgow Guardian, carries a splash about the university’s £3m investment in the arms trade, plus stories about tackling Glasgow stereotypes and where to get cheap cocktails. Wandering along University Avenue, I am offered a free bible, a copy of Socialist Worker and a flyer for pole-dancing classes. Plus ça change.

In room 243 – found despite the directions “between cloisters and south front” that I still find incomprehensible – I meet the four freshers I will be hanging out with. “It’s overwhelming,” says Nina Smith, 17, from Paisley, six miles south-west. “But it’s a nice place to be lost.” It is her first day and she is finding freshers’ week “a bit scary”. Studying German and music, she works part-time in Ikea (16 hours a week, often jumping to 25) and is starting a shift at 5pm. All four students have a part-time job or are looking for one. When I started, the year before tuition fees were introduced UK-wide and at the tail end of grants, I worked only during the summer holidays, pulling pints in a pub back home, and it was for spending money, not to get by. Smith, on the other hand, wasn’t even sure she was going to apply to university. What would she have done instead? “I was thinking about taking a gap year and working full-time. Saving money. Then I thought: ‘If I do that, I won’t want to go to uni.’”

Lewis Hannah, 17, is from Airdrie, to the east of Glasgow, and studying physics. Like Smith, he will be staying at home and commuting. “All my friends except one are staying at home,” he says. The next day, after an Abba/Queen “Massaoke” night – in which a live band played the bands’ hits and the lyrics were projected on to a giant screen for a singalong; you could attend only with a £48 freshers’ wristband – I phone to see how it went. “The union was packed. You could barely move.” Was it fun? “Yeah, I was there until the end, about 2am.” How did he get home? “My mum picked me up.”

Rachel Christie, 18, is the only one of the four staying in university accommodation. “Perth is too far,” she explains. What are her halls like? “A bit overpriced,” she says. “I would have preferred private accommodation.” Cooking for herself is “OK, but the kitchen is a mess. No one cleans up after themselves. And my oven doesn’t work.” She concedes that it is good for meeting people. When I phone her the following day, to see how her night out at an Iyaz gig went, the social benefits of halls are clear. “First I went to another flat with my friends and we drank there for a bit,” she says. Is she hungover? “No, just a bit tired,” she laughs.

She and Hannah are the first people in their families to go to university. Three out of four of the group are part of the UK-wide Widening Participation programme, which aims to attract people who live in certain postcode areas; have been in care; have caring responsibilities, a disability or an impairment; or are estranged from family.

Murrin Duggan, from outside Port Glasgow, 15 miles west of Glasgow, is one of a handful of 16-year-olds enrolling as a first-year undergraduate in 2019. She and Christie are studying French, Spanish and Portuguese. Although it is common for freshers to be 17 in Scotland, 16 is unusually young. Why did she come so early? “When Brexit comes, we don’t really know what’s going to happen,” Duggan says. “So that’s why I left school early. I just want to make sure I get into uni, because you never know. You might start getting charged for it, and it’s quite a lot of money.”

“I probably wouldn’t have come if you had to pay for it,” Christie adds.

“Same,” says Smith. “Go while you can.”

In Scotland, Scottish students get free university tuition, for which they have to re-apply each year. At Glasgow, half the students come from Scotland. I remember being struck not only by the university’s Scottishness, but also how Glaswegian it was. It also felt very white, especially in the arts and humanities departments where I studied English literature and philosophy. Everyone tells me how radically different the university is now, which is clear from the multitude of languages I hear on campus. There are about 6,500 international students, 3,000 EU students and 1,300 European staff. How this might change after Brexit remains to be seen. “EU students pay no tuition fees here,” explains Rachel Sandison, a vice-principal at the university. “It’s allowed us to welcome really high-quality European talent into Stem [science, technology, engineering and maths] subjects.” The consequences of a no-deal Brexit, she says, would be “huge”.

Memory is an unearthly form of archeology. I thought I remembered almost nothing of freshers’ week, but when I got off the tube at Hillhead subway station in the West End I experienced what the novelist Muriel Spark described as “an inpouring of love” for those intense days. The smell of hormones, disinfectant, cigarette smoke and club smoke machines. An excruciating traffic-light party at the GU union. (I wore amber.) The sound of Chumbawamba’s Tubthumping everywhere. A poster fair where I bought a Steve McQueen still from Bullitt, even though I had never seen the film and didn’t fancy its hypermasculine lead.

What I really remember, though, is drinking. A lot. It felt like an expectation and really good fun. A 1997 freshers’ guide sent to me by the archive department introduced the week as a “pre-term drinking and entertainment extravaganza organised in your honour”. One of the biggest changes in the two decades since I was a student is the way alcohol is perceived and consumed. According to a survey by University College London, 36% of 16- to 24-year-olds in full-time education abstain from drinking. “I was a bit nervous, because I don’t drink,” says Duggan. “But I’ve met a lot of people who don’t drink, either. It’s not what I expected.”

In the cloisters, after the surreal experience of stroking a pony with rainbow hair and a silver horn stuck to its forehead, we fight our way past a stall signing freshers up to six months’ free Amazon Prime. In 1997, the internet amounted to sitting in front of a Netscape Navigator screen and pretending to “do” the world wide web. None of the students I meet worry about online harassment. Yet, earlier this month, Dr Emma Short, the director of the National Centre for Cyberstalking Research at the University of Bedfordshire, said a watershed had been reached with the first generation of digital natives entering higher education. “The thresholds in universities for what has become normalised behaviour very often exceed criminal prosecution thresholds,” she tells me. “Things like persistent messaging, flooding messaging across platforms, pushing for DMs [direct messages]. The moment a person on the receiving end begins to feel fear and unease, you’re in the realm of harassment. And students will tolerate much higher levels of risk than I would say are safe levels.”

For Duggan, though, online interaction has helped make starting university less intimidating. “We’ve been in group chats on Facebook, so we already know people without going to a lecture yet,” says Duggan, who makes YouTube videos to take her mind off stress. “I’m a bit nervous coming to new places, so the uni’s YouTube campus tours really helped.”

“Since primary school, we’ve been taught how to take care online,” Hannah says. “It’s ingrained in the same way as looking left and right before crossing the road.”

We head to the freshers’ fair, which, depending on your personality, is a treasure trove of information and freebies or a sensory nightmare. All the world is here, from Women in Stem to the Grim Reapers quidditch club. I can’t remember attending it myself, but what is immediately apparent is the focus on what is referred to as “the student experience”. In my time, this would have been a euphemism for sex, drugs and booze; now, it means mental health and wellbeing, among other things.

When I was an undergraduate, if we were struggling, all the unspoken feelings spilled out as bravado and drunkenness – if you were lucky. If it got serious, it tended to be hushed up. Now, when one in five students has a mental health condition, the number of students seeking help has soared and mental health is at the top of the agenda. “There are unprecedented pressures on children and young adults that are flowing into universities,” says John de Pury, the assistant director of policy at Universities UK. “We have to be exemplary in terms of care and inclusiveness.” At Glasgow, where waiting times for assessment are nine days compared with the UK average of 52, all four freshers I speak to say they would not hesitate to tell someone if they were struggling.

In the English literature department, I track down my old lecturer, Dr Vassiliki Kolocontroni, in her book-lined office. How does she think students have changed since she taught me? “The pressures are much greater now,” she says. “Everything is a lot more quantified. In the 00s, students became a bit smug and apathetic. There was a sense in which university was a world in its own right. Now, I find students are more radicalised and prepared to understand what’s going on in the world. The level of engagement in politics is much greater.”

I didn’t know it at the time, but I went to university in a golden age. No one paid tuition fees. The future was secure enough to be uninteresting: I simply didn’t consider it. I was free to think, find out more about myself and have an obscene amount of fun. None of the freshers I speak to have voted. All would do so. They are ready to vote, march and have their say in a referendum, whether on Scottish independence or the EU.

For now, though, they need to go. There are vouchers to collect, events to attend, shifts to work and preparations to make for nights out. Duggan and Christie are off to a language cafe, where dozens of students from all over the world will sit around tables in a strip-lit canteen, talking to each other in more than 20 languages. Smith has to go to work. Hannah has to head home to get ready for tonight. Student life goes on. Meanwhile, I head for the train with a middle-aged spring in my step. The kids may not always be all right, but they give me hope for the future.

20,Technology,"Amazon launches Alexa smart ring, smart glasses and earbuds",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/26/amazon-launches-alexa-smart-ring-smart-glasses-and-earbuds,2019-09-26T10:23:41Z,"Amazon wants its Alexa voice assistant to leave the home and be with you everywhere you go, and is turning to wearable technology to achieve this.

Unveiled at an event in Seattle on Wednesday, Amazon’s new Echo Frames smart glasses, Echo Loop ring and Echo Buds aim to put Alexa on your face, your hand or in your ears.

The $179.99 (£146) Echo Frames are equipped with directional speakers similar to the Bose Frames smart glasses, and have microphones for Alexa, which connects to a phone to read out emails, text messages and other information. The smart glasses do not have a display or camera – seeking to avoid the stigma associated with Google’s Glass – but can be equipped with prescription lenses.

The $129.99 Echo Loop is a smart ring that vibrates to alert users of notifications, while built-in microphones and a speaker can be used to interact with Alexa – an experience attendees in Seattle described as being akin to “whispering a secret to Alexa”.

The Loop and Frames will have a limited release in a trial from its skunkworks hardware development division. But the Echo Buds, competitors to Apple’s AirPods, will get a wide release costing £119.99 in the UK and $129.99 in the US.

They feature a true wireless design, Bose active noise reduction technology and, of course, integrated Alexa functionality similar to that provided by Siri with second-generation AirPods.

Geoff Blaber, the vice-president of research for the Americas at market analysts CCS Insight, said: “Amazon is doing what it does best. Entering new categories with new features and disrupting aggressively on price.

“With Echo Frames and Echo Loop Amazon is offering consumers the opportunity to help it experiment in new areas. The more Alexa usage grows, the lower hardware pricing becomes. This should be a significant concern for Amazon’s competitors.”

Amazon also launched a deluge of other Alexa-powered devices, including a smart oven, an updated Echo Dot (£59.99) with an integrated clock, an improved standard Echo (£89.99), the smaller and cheaper Echo Flex (£24.99) that plugs straight into the wall, a premium sound Sonos One competitor called the Echo Studio (£189.99), an 8in Echo Show 8 (£119.99) smart display and the Echo Glow smart lamp for kids. It also launched a pet tracker called Fetch powered by its new long-range, low-power networking technology called Sidewalk.

Amazon’s Ring also launched a cheaper indoor security camera and its Eero division launched a line of mesh wifi systems that integrate with Alexa and aim to undercut the competition on price.

Looking to assuage privacy fears as Alexa ventures out of the home and into every part of customers’ lives, Amazon also announced some changes to the way it handles voice data, including the ability to automatically delete voice recordings every three or 18 months.

Amazon also said it has improved the software responsible for listening out for the wake word “Alexa”, increasing accuracy by 50% in the last 12 months and reducing false activations as a result. Errant activations and the potential for them to end up recording private conversations have been a focus of privacy concerns.

Amazon’s head of devices, Dave Limp, said the company was committed to privacy, making it “foundational” to every device, arguing a service “can’t be private unless you give [customers] this control” over use of their data and recordings.

The firm also launched its first celebrity voice for Alexa: actor Samuel L Jackson, which will cost $4.99 and be available in a “clean” version for those who do not want to hear Jackson curse. Amazon said other celebrity voices would be added next year.

21,Technology,"Best true wireless earbuds 2019: AirPods, Samsung, Jabra, Beats and Anker compared and ranked",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/01/best-true-wireless-earbuds-airpods-samsung-jabra-sennheiser-anker-compared-and-ranked,2019-09-26T06:01:39Z,"Our updated list of great bluetooth truly wireless earbuds – at the best prices right now

It wasn’t long ago that true wireless earbuds, those that don’t need any wires even between the earphones, weren’t very good. Solid connectivity was a challenge, dropouts were infuriatingly common and battery life was woeful.

But they all offered that taste of freedom from wires that is like a ratchet – once you’ve experienced tangle-free listening, you’ll never go back.

Now there are loads of truly wireless earbuds on the market offering all sorts of features, designs and sound. None of them are bargain basement, and it’s difficult to know which ones are worth buying. So here’s a guide to separate the wheat from the chaff.

This Guardian buyer’s guide to true wireless earbuds was last updated on 26 September, and represents the best available models at the time. As new models are released and tested, this guide will be updated to help you choose the right earbuds for you.

Nailing the combination of connectivity, sound, in-ear comfort, controls and case size has proved far more difficult for truly wireless earbuds than you might expect. Thankfully Samsung has managed it on the third try.

The Galaxy Buds are small, light and comfortable earbuds, with a traditional silicone tip on one end and a small body that sits within your concha, even if you have fairly small ears, allowing you to completely forget about them. They come with a series of soft stabilising wings if you need them, but stay put perfectly fine without them.

A touchpad on the outside takes care of controls. Tap to pause or play, double and triple-tap to skip track. A touch and hold gesture can be switched between turning on or temporarily piping ambient sound into the earbuds, triggering your voice assistant or to change the volume (left to go down, right to turn it up). Take both earbuds out and the music automatically pauses. It all works very well, although I wish you could trigger ambient sound on pause.

The Galaxy Buds sound pretty good too, with reasonable sound isolation and a well-rounded tone most will like. They’re fairly balanced, not overly dominated by bass or treble, with good separation and punch where needed. The buds are capable of uncomfortable volume levels when cranked right up and there’s a limited EQ available in the Galaxy Wearable app. Audiophiles might turn their noses up, but they sound good compared with the competition at this price.

Bluetooth connectivity between the buds and to the phone is rock solid, regardless of whether you’re using a Samsung or other phone. They can be used as a stereo pair, individually and hot-swapped between left and right in mono without skipping a beat, even when on a call – something only Apple’s AirPods have been capable of until now. The Galaxy Buds support AAC and Samsung’s proprietary scalable codec for high-quality music, with no noticeable lipsync issues even when connected to a non-Samsung device. Call quality is good, but a little distant similar to when you’re on speaker phone.

Even the case is really good. It flips open and closed with a satisfying snap, is small enough to fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans and provides just over one full charge of the earbuds. Combined that means the Galaxy Buds will last up to six hours of continuous playback with an additional seven hours in the case. In practice that means having to charge them once a week for the commute via the USB-C port or even wireless charging on any Qi-compatible pad or phone.

Pairing with an Android phone with Samsung’s Galaxy Wearable app installed is as easy as opening them up and waiting for the prompt. Everything else needs a quick trip into the settings menu like any other Bluetooth device. They worked well with various Android phones, PCs, iPads and iPhones.

When paired with an Android phone you can also get the Galaxy Buds to read out notifications, which is far more useful than it sounds; if you limit the number of apps, that can interrupt your music to just a few. There’s no iOS app for changing settings, which means you need at least one Android, PC or Mac in your life to make sure they’re up to date.

Why should I buy them?

The Galaxy Buds offer the best combination of sound, connectivity, size, comfort case and price, making them the ones to buy for Android unless you don’t like canal-buds.

Buy if: you want a simple set of truly wireless earbuds that just work

Don’t buy if: you only use iOS or don’t like canal-buds

Third time’s the charm for Sony. The WF-1000XM3 finally live up to the Sony heritage with not only effective noise cancelling but truly great sound too.

The M3 part of the name aligns them with Sony’s excellent WH-1000XM3 headphones, which have class-leading sound and noise cancelling. The true wireless earbud version inherits the same noise cancelling chip and are almost as effective, reducing or eliminating train, road and plane noise, leaving you free to listen to your music at lower, more comfortable volumes.

The sound sparkles with detail, energy and clarity, while punchy bass produces a lovely full sound, just edging out the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless.

Bluetooth 5 means connectivity is strong and lipsync issues have been eliminated. While the design is attractive, particularly in the black and copper colour, the earbuds are massive and took a bit of trial and error to get the fit right with the correct earbud tip (seven pairs are included). Controls are good, but lack volume on the earbud. Touch and hold one to activate ambient passthrough to listen out for announcements.

Battery life is solid too, lasting up to six hours with noise cancelling active or eight with it off, and up to 32 hours with trips in the case. Like the earbuds the case is also fairly large and difficult to pocket. They’re not cheap, but if you want genuinely great sound, the WF-1000XM3 are the ones to buy.

Why should you buy them?

Brilliant sound, excellent noise cancelling and solid connectivity, complemented by solid battery life and an attractive design, the WF-1000XM3 are the best-sounding true wireless earbuds yet.

Buy if: you want the best sound and great noise cancelling

Don’t but if: you want something smaller and more pocket-friendly

If you don’t like blocking out the world, or can’t get on with canal-bud style earphones that enter your ear, look no further than Apple’s AirPods, now in their second generation.

They gently rest in your ear with little white stalks sticking down, projecting the sound down your ear holes rather than sitting directly in them. As a consequence you can hear everything happening around you meaning you won’t be able to hear your music on something as loud as the tube in London, and if cranked up to maximum they bleed sound, although not as badly as Apple’s non-wireless EarPods. They sound pretty good considering the lack of isolation, with reasonable bass and clarity.

The AirPods work best with Apple gear, automatically syncing pairing across any Apple devices you might have, but can also be paired with Android or other devices. Connectivity is rock solid with an iPhone and recent Android devices and PCs.

Where they fall down is on-board controls - there’s basically just one, a double tap. When connected to a non-iPhone it pauses or plays music. Hooked up to an iOS device you have the option to trigger Siri, pause or skip track on each earbud, which means one can summon Siri while the other pauses. There’s no volume control. Take them out and it pauses the music.

With the second generation AirPods you can also just say “Hey Siri” at any time without having to tap anything to activate Apple’s voice assistant. After having to re-teach Siri to recognise my voice, it generally worked well, even with music blasting out. But Siri can be a little slow, particularly when you have poor connectivity on your smartphone. You also get odd looks doing so on public transport.

The AirPods’ other strengths are that you can use either of the earbuds in mono, call quality is pretty good, and the charging case is the best in the business. The AirPods last about five hours of music and can be fully charged around five times by the case, which itself is charged via a Lightning cable. They are also available with a new wireless charging case (£40/$40 extra) for powering up on Qi-compatible chargers.

Why should I buy them?

Seamless connectivity with Apple products is key, but they sound pretty good, have an excellent case and are a decent alternative to canal-buds, even for Android users

Buy if: you use Apple products and don’t need sound isolation

Don’t buy if: you want to block out the sounds outside world

If you want the smallest, most discreet wireless earbuds available, the Earin M-2 deliver. These tiny earbuds sit within your ear with only a flat touch-sensitive surface visible.

Available in black or white, they’re light and easy to forget you’re wearing them. They produce a balanced, relatively flat sound with good treble and fairly crisp highs. Those looking for pumping bass or truly sparkling audio will have to look elsewhere, but they make a good go of most music genres.

An Android or iOS app sorts updates, and tweaks transparency settings, but there are no equaliser settings.

Noise isolation is good but not great. The M-2s can feed ambient sound in when the music pauses, but it sounds like you’re listening to the world down an old phone line - fine for listening to an announcement but it takes some getting used to.

Unusually, there’s no left or right earbud. They can be inserted in either ear with the buds working out which way round they are, and either can be used on its own for mono listening. They support AAC and aptX, and maintain a stable connection to your phone and between the earbuds, which communicate via magnetic induction, not Bluetooth. The result is lag and lipsync issue-free audio. Call quality is good, but a little quiet, meaning you’ll have to speak up, and there’s no sidetone, so it’s difficult to know how loud you’re talking.

Tap once to pause, twice to skip track or tap and hold to invoke Google Assistant or Siri on either bud. The controls work well, but there’s no volume control at all, so you’ll have to reach for your phone for that.

They last a good three hours of constant playback and charge about three times in the cylindrical aluminium case, which slides open and shut with a satisfying clunk.

Why should you buy them?

If you want your truly wireless earbuds to be as small as possible, but still have good sound, great connectivity and a good case, the Earin M-2 are it.

Buy if: you want the the smallest of truly wireless earbuds

Don’t buy if: you want a smaller case or better sound

If you wish Apple’s AirPods had better isolation and gripped on to your ear like a vice, look no further than the Beats PowerBeats Pro.

Like the AirPods the PowerBeats Pro have great connectivity with an iPhone, which courtesy of the Beats app even extends to Android. Rock solid connectivity in all conditions is paired with excellent controls. Both earbuds have proper volume rocker controls, plus a multifunction button for controlling playback, skipping tracks or activating Siri or Google Assistant.

The flexible ear hook loops over the back of your ear and with a bit of adjustment holds them firmly in place on your head - no amount of jumping, giggling or pounding the tarmac is going to shake these free. They’re also sweat resistant so will be fine in the rain or hard workout; just don’t run them under a tap.

The silicone earbud tip offers some isolation from the world around you. The forward, energetic sound is ideal for powering through a run or gym session, while also doing a good job with most music genres, banishing the all-bass Beats sound profile to the history books.

Call quality is excellent too, while battery life is a class-leading eight hours with another 1.5 charges in the case.

The enormous case is the worst thing about them. It’s robust and works just fine, but you’re not going to be able to fit it in a pocket. They’re also pricy, so if you just want basic buds for the gym, these aren’t for you.

Why should you buy them?

You want the AirPod-like convenience of connectivity and features with an iPhone (or Android with app), with class-leading battery, good sound, excellent controls including a real volume rocker, plus an ear hook design that’s unshakeable.

Buy if: you want rock-solid all-rounders that won’t come off no matter what you do

Don’t but if: you want something smaller and cheaper

Creative, known for PC soundcards and MP3 players from the 90s and 2000s and now gaming headsets and headphones, produces some of the best value true wireless earbuds around.

The Creative Outlier Air (also available in a more expensive “gold” variant) manage to tick almost every box. They’re light and comfortable to wear for extended periods, with a kidney shape that keeps most of the hard plastic body away from the fleshy bits of your ears. A traditional silicone earbud tip holds it in place fairly well, but only two sets are included in the box, meaning you might need to buy some extra ones if it doesn’t make a good enough seal.

They have excellent connectivity with Bluetooth 5, SBC, AAC and aptX support, can be used independently and best of all last up to 10 hours between trips in the case, which is about double the average battery life of most true wireless earbuds.

The case is fairly big, but is light, just about pocketable and holds two full charges of the earbuds, making up to 30 hours before needing to be topped up by USB-C.

The Outlier Air sound surprisingly good for the money too, producing well-rounded audio with punch in the bass (once you get a good seal at least) and good clarity in the mids and highs. They won’t touch the best-sounding, but they are a cut above the competition at this price and will even give the likes of the Galaxy Buds and AirPods a run for their money.

A button on either bud takes care of playback and volume control, which is a bit stiff, requiring you to grip the bud with your index finger and press the button with your thumb. Press once to pause/play, twice on the left to skip back or on the right to skip forward. Pressing and holding on the left turns the volume down or on the right turns the volume up.

Call quality is surprisingly good, with only a little bit of background noise audible by the recipient while speaking. The earbuds are also IPX5 sweat-proof so fine for a run or similar. Small niggles include poor selection of earbud tips, a slight hiss on pause and hints of lipsync issues with Amazon Prime Video and YouTube.

Why should you buy them?

Great sound, connectivity and long battery life, plus solid controls including volume, combine with an OK case to make some excellent value true wireless earbuds.

Buy if: you want great-sounding truly wireless earbuds on a budget

Don’t buy if: you want a small case (buy the Anker Liberty Air instead)

These truly wireless earbuds are still worth buying, if the top five don’t fit the bill.

Anker’s AirPod-like true wireless earbuds are second only to the Creative Outlier Air as the best budget option. They have good but not great sound, solid connectivity and AAC support in a light and comfortable earbud design with stalks.

Controls are basic, with no volume control, but call quality is excellent and the case is one of the smaller and easier to pocket variety. You’ll get four hours out of the earbuds and an extra three charges in the case.

Anker’s smaller true wireless earbuds are an excellent budget option, but have a larger case and are bettered on sound and call quality by the Liberty Air. They can be found for slightly cheaper and don’t have the AirPod-like stalk design, so are still worth buying if the price or earbud design suits you better. Not good for phone calls though.

B&O’s second-generation E8 are a solid mix of sound quality and connectivity with a fairly small case. They last just under four hours’ playtime, with two full charges in the case, which itself is charged via USB-C or Qi wireless charging. Touch panels on each earbud take care of controls, including volume, and they have an reasonable transparency mode too. They support AAC, can connect to two devices simultaneously, but can’t be used independently. Call quality is reasonable.

The biggest issue is their size: the E8s are massive for earbuds and don’t feel all that stable in your ears unless you use the included Comply foam tips. They’re also expensive and bettered by the Sennheisers on the audio quality front.

If you want more isolation than the AirPods but can’t get on with canal-bud style tips, the Bose SoundSport Free provide a good halfway house. The StayHear+ tips rest in your concha but don’t enter your ear canal, holding themselves in-place with a flexible fin.

They sound good, connectivity is rock solid with AAC support, call quality is really good, and they last more than four hours between charges. The large case provides two full charges. The biggest problem is that they’re huge and stick out your ear a mile. At least the call quality is good.

The Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 come very close to delivering on all counts. They have rock-solid Bluetooth 5 connectivity with AAC and aptX support, long eight-hour battery, good controls including a way to adjust volume and they even sound good, with balanced, rounded audio.

The case is also one of the best available, adding up to 36 hours of playback to the earbuds while still being very pocketable, fitting into the money pocket of a pair of jeans long with only a handful of the best.

The problem is, they’re huge. They have a really large aperture making getting the earbud tip to fit without blocking your ear canal a bit of a chore and they stick out a mile, looking like something Nichelle Nichols’s Uhura would use in classic Star Trek. The big trunk is uncomfortable in my ears, meaning any 30-minute-plus listening becomes painful. A real shame.

The Jabra Elite 65t are a good alternative to the Samsung Galaxy Buds. They have rock-solid connectivity, support for AAC, no noticeable lipsync issues and sound good, with punchy, controlled bass plus a full equaliser in the Jabra Sound+ app.

There are volume/track skip buttons on the left earbud and a pause/play button on the right, which activates ambient sound when double pressed. Call quality is good with clear voice, but background noise bleeds into the mic a little. The case is pretty compact and charges the buds twice totalling to 12 hours’ playback.

The Elite 65t twist to lock in place in the ear, but are fairly large and uncomfortable for longer listening sessions for smaller ears.

Some of the best true wireless earbuds available, the Track Air+ are narrowly beaten by the Samsung Galaxy Buds for general earbuds on price and Sony’s WF-1000XM3 on noise cancelling.

The Libratones have it all: attractive design, rock-solid Bluetooth 5 connectivity with aptX support, great sound and even reasonably effective noise cancelling. Add to that a tiny case that’ll fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans just like the Galaxy Buds and AirPods, and has wireless charging. Plus battery life of just shy of six hours and three charges in the case. They’re even sweat resistant.

The downsides are lack of volume control on the earbuds, lack of AAC support for an iPhone and an easily marked case. Still, if you wish Apple made noise-cancelling AirPods with silicone earbud tips for a better fit, the Libratone Track Air+ are the ones to buy.

If the Sennheiser Momentum Wireless don’t fit the bill but you want great sound, then the Master and Dynamic MW07 are worth a look.

They sound good, with pronounced bass and crisp highs, but fall slightly short of the better-sounding Sennheiser. There’s a slight hiss when nothing is playing, but have rock-solid connectivity with AAC and aptX support. The buds are also fairly large and certainly a statement in piano gloss. The wings are a bit uncomfortable, but I didn’t need them.

The case is medium sized, and feels good in the hand, but is heavy and the earbuds don’t quite snap into place unless the lid is closed. Physical buttons for controls are great, including volume. Calls sounded echoey.

Like black Apple AirPods but with a traditional isolating earbud on the end to enter your ear, the RHA TrueConnect sound good with strong bass and solid isolation, but poor call quality.

Connectivity is pretty good including AAC support, with only a very occasional blip while suffering only minimal lipsync issues with video. Latency is more of an issue with games. They last four hours per charge, with four full charges in an attractive, medium-sized case.

A button on each earbud handles volume, track skip, pause, play and the voice assistant all accessible with multiple clicks. The button felt mushy on one set requiring replacement.

Previously ranked as the best-sounding true wireless earbuds, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless are still great. The earbuds are quite large, but are comfortable with a solid set of earbud tips. They last up to four hours between trips in the case, which itself is one of the better ones, although not quite as pocketable as the best.

Connectivity is excellent, supporting Bluetooth 5 with AAC, aptX and the new aptX Low Latency codecs, and no hint of latency issues. Call quality was good but a bit distant. Silver touch pads handle playback and volume control.

The best bit is how they sound: rich, lively and warm, with produce crisp highs and deep bass, sounding great with most music genres.

The Tranya T3 are a solid set of budget true wireless earbuds with a reasonably bassy sound, good connectivity and AAC support. A button on each earbud takes care of controls. Isolation is fairly weak and the case is pretty bulky and easily marked. Call quality was abysmal and there was a small lipsync issue with YouTube on an iPhone.

Jabra Elite Sport – Big, bulky and bettered by the newer Jabra Elite 65t – £200

NuForce BE Free8 – OK sound, but constant hiss and connectivity issues – £200

Rowkin Ascent Micro – small, sound OK, but serious latency issues – £125

Skullycandy Indy – Sound ok, but get stuck in the case and suffer lag with an iPhone – £70

Taotronics BH053 – sound OK, but cheap plastic with questionable durability and lag with YouTube – £38

22,Film,Midnight Traveler: a powerful refugee documentary filmed on a phone,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/24/midnight-traveler-refugee-documentary-afghanistan,2019-09-25T05:00:18Z,"In 2015, Hassan Fazili, an Afghan film-maker, and his family – his wife and fellow film-maker Fatima Hussaini and their young daughters, Nargis and Zahra – were running out of time. They had fled Afghanistan for Tajikistan 14 months earlier after the Taliban targeted their Kabul arts cafe, and soon Tajikistan would send them back. As their choices narrowed, the Fazilis consulted with Emelie Mahdavian, a California-based documentarian they met in Tajikistan, on the possibility of documenting their journey with the only equipment available: their mobile phones.

Four years later, what began as a few cellphone videos has emerged as Midnight Traveler, a feature-length documentary on one family’s still unfinished journey to safety and stability. The plight of Europe’s largest refugee crisis since the second world war – a million refugees in 2015 alone – is well documented and gutting, on film and in print. Countless headlines on the risks of travel to Europe – downed boats, the photo of Alan Kurdi, a two-year-old who drowned, on the beach in Greece – serve as shorthand for an experience many understand in broad strokes, in unspecific sympathy for someone else’s unfathomable pain and stress.

Midnight Traveler is, intentionally, not one of those stories. The movie, shot entirely by Hassan and his family on three Samsung phones, is less a migration story than the story of a family’s formative years; their liminal status as refugees without a home country is relegated from headline to the background. “There’s already so much information out there in the press that’s journalistic and valid; documentary films made by outsiders who are trying to document what’s happening,” Mahdavian told the Guardian. “What this film can offer is that other side of the story.”

Midnight Traveler is a film not only of the Fazili family’s own words, but of their own creation – what one would record of a family trip, to remember its highlights and mundanities later. Under the Fazilis’ direction, Midnight Traveler steers attention from the collar-grabbing to the soft, nostalgic, logistical and specific. “We wanted the audience to be closer to our happiness, unhappiness, dreams and feelings,” Hassan Fazili told Filmmaker Magazine in January 2019. “We wanted the viewer to feel that they are by our side during the film, to laugh and cry with us, to feel homeless and confused with us so they would not just watch us from a distance.” His camera follows a range of emotions, beyond fear. Nargis, the older daughter, revels next to the foaming sea in Turkey; later, a year into their journey, she bursts into tears from sheer boredom. Hassan films Zahra, the younger daughter, laughing in the Serbian snow and developing boils from the filthy conditions of a refugee camp. The trials of a prolonged migration emerge through details, sometimes terrifying (vile anti-immigrant thugs in Bulgaria threatening to punch Nargis), sometimes subdued (a pages-long list, tacked to a wall, of families waiting for entry to Hungary).

But a trove of home movies do not make a film. Enter Mahdavian, who kept in touch with the family throughout their journey through Afghanistan, Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia and the film’s conclusion in Hungary, and who sorted through all 300 hours of their footage. (The Fazilis periodically delivered their phones’ memory cards to a messenger, who sent a hard drive to Mahdavian, who speaks Afghan Persian).

From there, she would watch and catalogue all the footage, pulling out the most pivotal and quietly characteristic scenes. “What makes this film what it is is not the dramatic things that happen to them that we expect to see,” she said of her editing process. “For me, it’s the small things – the family fights, the kids playing and dancing and crying.” Thus the footage of running through European fields at dawn to avoid police is kept spare and unheralded; scenes in which Hassan and Fatima bicker and laugh over his compliment to another woman, or in which Nargis discusses with her parents whether or not to cover her hair, are allowed to breathe.

But despite its DIY aesthetic, “a film like this doesn’t become the film that you’re seeing if all it was is mobile-phone footage cut together in Premiere and exported”, said Mahdavian. It’s no small feat of post-production to make phone videos, with no external microphone, both watchable and audible. “The film is really built on the editing and the extensive post-production,” said Su Kim, the film’s producer, who shepherded it through sound editing and re-coloring. Ironically, while Mahdavian cut the film to “unclean it up – to avoid editing norms, and to make you aware that they were mobile phones”, the sound team worked to buffer up the audio enough to translate the experience of cell video to a bigger screen.

The phone itself is a constant presence within the film, its screen – showing maps of Turkish countryside, WhatsApp, video of Nargis dancing to Michael Jackson’s They Don’t Care About Us played through another phone – shaping both the perception and direction of their journey. “A lot of people have documented how central [the mobile phone] is to the migrant experience,” said Mahdavian. “Whether you are or are not a film-maker, it’s a lifeline for so many people.” A lifeline, and a semblance of control; every member of the Fazili family takes their turn capturing the experience – Fatima films Hassan, Hassan films Zahra, someone films Nargis filming her stuff bear, framed with barbed wire at a detention center on the Hungarian border. “This was a family-generated portrait, not just a father-generated portrait,” Mahdavian said.

As such, the ethics of filming – autobiography of your own family’s painful and vulnerable moments – grow into one of Midnight Traveler’s biggest, and most potent, themes. In a pivotal, masterful scene (one that shouldn’t be spoiled), Hassan recalls a particularly dramatic and scary moment in the family’s journey. The story is told in voiceover, over peaceful footage of the moon and birds. Hassan loves film-making, he says, “but sometimes cinema is so dirty”. For one moment, he thinks not of his family’s safety, but of the drama’s potential on screen. “What a scene you’re in!” he thinks. “This is the best scene in the film.” And in that moment, he says, he hates himself so much.

What happens when the processing of experience becomes inextricable from its recording, when living in the moment becomes simultaneous with understanding how you can use the moment in the story you will tell others? It’s the strange warping of reality familiar to many, whether you’re capturing a “candid” shot of your friends at the bar for Instagram or in the vastly heightened stakes of a migrant’s journey.

For the Fazilis, the ethics of autobiography remain fraught and unresolved, as does the family’s immigration status. In his imagination, Hassan says, the film ends when they reach their destination; in reality, the film ends in Hungary, with their case in limbo. In April 2018, the Fazilis arrived in Germany, where they remain today, both girls in school, according to Mahdavian and Kim. But their asylum application was restarted, putting them back at back square one, still in limbo.

23,Technology,Libratone Track Air+ review: the noise-cancelling AirPods Apple won’t give you,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/20/libratone-track-air-review-the-noise-cancelling-airpods-apple-wont-give-you,2019-09-20T06:01:11Z,"Libratone has given us the better fitting AirPods that Apple wouldn’t, with great sound and noise cancelling.

The Danish audio firm’s Track Air+ are a set of true wireless earbuds, priced at £179, that follow the familiar design of earbud with stalk but no cable.

Unlike the vast majority of AirPod-a-likes the Track Air+ actually look different, with triangular-shaped metallic stalks that almost look like an earring mounted on a pill-shaped lump with an earbud tip sticking out one end. Even in white you’re not going to confuse these with Apple’s earbuds, and that’s a good thing.

The simple, attractive design is subtle enough to go fairly unnoticed in your ear, but different enough to be attractive, particularly in black and silver.

The lump containing most of the workings fits beautifully in the concha of your ear, with the earbud tip slotted into a secure and comfortable position down your ear canal with a small twist. Even the stalks fit nicely in the gap between your lobe and tragus. At 5.6g each the earbuds are pretty small and light, and not once did they feel like they would fall out.

Everyone’s ears are different, but the Track Air+ are some of the most comfortable earbuds of any size or shape I’ve worn.

The Track Air+ magnetically slot into a charging case that’s one of the best in the business. It’s small enough to fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans, making it one of only a handful of truly wireless earbuds that are that pocketable with the Samsung Galaxy Buds and Apple’s AirPods.

The case charges via USB-C or wireless charging, which is handy, and will charge the earbuds up to three times. The Track Air+ lasted just shy of six hours with noise cancelling active, meaning you get about 24 hours of playback with trips in the case.

The only slight niggles on the case are that, while the lid shuts securely with magnets, the hinge feels a little flimsy and will need a little bit of care in handling and the plastic body is easily marked.

The Track Air+ support Bluetooth 5.0 and can be used individually. They also support the standard Bluetooth audio format SBC and Qualcomm’s high-quality aptX, but strangely not AAC. While that’s not an issue for Android and Windows users, as aptX is built into both, Apple devices do not support aptX, with AAC their highest-quality supported Bluetooth audio codec, meaning the Track Air+ default to SBC.

Most will not notice, but SBC has a higher latency, which means the Track Air+ suffered from a more noticeable audio delay with games on iOS than on Android. Lipsync issues were minimal with all major video apps on Android and there was only a minor delay noticeable with YouTube on an iPhone.

Connectivity was rock solid with the majority of phones, including a OnePlus 7 Pro and iPhone XS, even in the most challenging of situations. Only once did I notice a momentary blip with a Google Pixel 3XL exiting the London underground at Liverpool Street.

One of the weak points of the Libratone are the onboard controls. A double tap on either earbud can do one of the following: play/pause, switch noise cancelling mode, skip track forward or activate your phone’s voice assistant. I set the left bud to skip track and the right bud to pause, but there’s no volume control, meaning it’s a trip to your phone to turn the music up or down.

Removing both earbuds pauses the music and it resumes when you put one back in. A button in the case puts the buds into pairing mode, while the Libratone app takes care of settings. You can also check the battery of the earbuds and the case in the app.

One of the best bits is how the Track Air+ sound, with a good amount of punchy bass and clarity rivalling some of the better sounding true wireless earbuds, while falling slightly shy of the big Sony WF-1000XM3 as the best. Feed them some aggressive rock or electronica and be richly rewarded, but they manage to do a good job of most genres.

A basic EQ allows you to switch between neutral, extra bass or enhanced treble profiles, sounding best left in neutral. The silicone earbud tip, of which you get four sizes in the box, also does a good job of blocking out noise, but the Track Air+ also have noise cancelling built in. While it isn’t anywhere near as effective as that deployed by Sony’s new top earbuds or Bose, it dealt with the drone of plane engines well and managed to make a dent in most commuting noise too.

You can adjust the noise cancelling through 30 levels, either manually or automatically based on your environment using the Libratone app on your phone. The earbuds sounded slightly less full in the mid-range with noise cancelling cranked up to maximum, but the trade-off seemed worth it in noisy environments.

The Track Air+ struggled with wind noise with noise cancelling active. The ambient monitoring mode is excellent, sounding natural enough to hold a conversation fairly easy. I mainly used it to listen out for announcements.

Call quality was pretty good too, with recipients saying I sounded fairly clear with only a little bit of loud background noise audible.
• None The Track Air+ are sweatproof (IPX4), so fine for running or the gym.
• None The angle of the stalks can clash with some larger earrings.
• None The case has an LED on the inside that shows when it’s charging, but you have to have the lid open.
• None If you have Bluetooth 5.0 on your phone then when you pair the left earbud the right one requests automatic pairing immediately afterwards so you can use them independently.
• None You can only connect to one device at a time (but can pair many).

The Libratone Track Air+ cost £179 in white or black.

For comparison, Apple’s AirPods cost £159, or £199 with wireless charging case, Sony’s WF-1000XM3 cost £220, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless cost £280, the B&O E8 2.0 cost £300 and the Master & Dynamic MW07 cost £279.

The Libratone Track Air+ are some of the best true wireless earbuds available at the moment – very nearly the isolating, noise-cancelling AirPods Apple won’t give us.

They have a stalk design but are attractive and don’t look like AirPod clones. They are some of the most comfortable earbuds I have ever worn: small and light enough you simply forget they’re in, but stay put and block out noise. The case is one of the best in the business too; truly pocketable with USB-C and wireless charging, and you can check the battery level in an app.

Connectivity was rock solid to both phones and tablets, with aptX for Android and Windows. Sound quality was really good, falling just shy of the very best true wireless earbuds available. And they have pretty effective noise cancelling.

They are not quite perfect, but the only minus points are lack of volume control on the earbuds and the curious lack of AAC support, which is only a fairly small issue for iOS users.

At £179 they’re not cheap, but undercut Apple’s AirPods with wireless charging case by £20 and Sony’s WF-1000XM3 by £40, making them pretty good value by comparison.

If you want great-fitting, great-sounding true wireless earbuds that last a long time and fit into an excellently pocketable case then the Libratone Track Air+ tick every box, and have noise cancelling as the cherry on top.

24,Technology,Huawei forced to launch Mate 30 phone without Google apps,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/19/huawei-forced-launch-mate-30-android-smartphone-no-google-apps-donald-trump,2019-09-19T15:18:53Z,"The launch of Huawei’s latest smartphone, the Mate 30, has been hampered by the ongoing trade war between China and the US, which has resulted in Google pulling its apps and services from the company’s new devices.

Announced in Munich on Thursday, the high-end Mate 30 series, which features Huawei’s latest class-leading camera and 5G technology, runs Android 10 but not the Google version. It lacks Google’s apps, such as Gmail and Chrome, Google’s Play Store and the associated Google Play Services, which increasingly form the backend of all Android apps developed for a western audience. Instead Huawei is pushing its own “fully open” mobile services platform for Android.

That is because Huawei is still on Donald Trump’s blacklist, which prevents US companies doing business with it including issuing licences to use software, as Google does for its apps and services. Despite the US government issuing two temporary 90-day reprieves for Huawei, they only cover existing products, not new ones.

While Google services are not included on phones sold in China, where they are loaded with alternatives from Chinese companies, Google’s apps are considered essential for the western market. It is possible enterprising users may be able to load Google’s app suite on to the phones, but the lack of out-of-box support could be a dealbreaker for many.

“Huawei has already developed a strong brand in Europe and I’m sure there will be a market for any new products given Huawei’s good track record in slick design and leading edge features such as multiple cameras with great zoom capability,” said Ben Wood, the chief of research at CCS Insight. “However, not having Google services will mean it’s a huge challenge for customers. There is also a risk consumers will buy a new Huawei and then find it does not offer everything they expected and will decide to return it.”

As such it may be a killer blow to sales of the Mate 30 and therefore Huawei’s ambition to be the largest smartphone manufacturer by volume. It was second behind only Samsung until Trump’s action, but its market share has since dropped by 5% in Europe. Huawei expects the US ban to cost it £8bn.

“It is very hard to see how Huawei can become the world’s biggest mobile phone maker at present given it is banned in the US market and it has suffered serious reputational damage as a result of being added to the US ‘entity list’,” said Wood. “Until those issues are resolved its main focus will have to be on its home market in China where it has a very strong position and is already selling tens of millions of units every quarter.”

Huawei has attempted to get around the US restrictions outside of China by launching a revamped version of its existing P30 Pro, with new colours and new Android 10 software complete with Google apps. It has also pledged to bring Android 10 – in the guise of its custom version, EMUI 10 – to many of its existing models by the end of the year.

The new top-of-the-line Mate 30 Pro features a 6.53in Horizon Display flexible OLED, which curves to 88 degrees around the left and right sides of the device and replaces the physical volume buttons with virtual sliders. It features both a second-generation in-display fingerprint sensor and 3D face recognition.

A circular array of cameras on the back includes a 40MP main camera, a 40MP ultra-wide, an 8MP 3x optical zoom camera and a depth sensor. Huawei said it was capable of professional video capture and up to 7,680 fframes per second super-slow motion – where competitors are limited to 960fps.

Huawei has said the new 5G version of phone also has some of the widest support of 5G bands of any device, enabling it to work in more regions around the world, and faster than any other phone including the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G. It also supports dual-sim 5G, for using two networks at once, and has a large 4,500mAh battery to keep it running for longer.

Huawei also introduced new vegan leather editions, alongside various glass colours, and continued its design collaboration with Porsche Design, previously seen in the Mate 30 RS.

It also launched a new smartwatch and the AI-powered Vision TV. The Mate 30 will cost €799, while the Mate 30 Pro will be €1,099 or €1,199 with 5G, but the company did not announce when or where it would go on sale.",0.9742,
25,Technology,Fairphone 3 review: the most ethical and repairable phone you can buy,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/18/fairphone-3-review-ethical-phone,2019-09-18T06:01:10Z,"Dutch firm asks £200 above the norm for a smartphone that might help change the industry

What if you could buy a phone that will last five years, can be easily repaired and is made as ethically as possible? That’s the aim of the latest Fairphone 3 – and on many counts it succeeds.

Ethically creating a phone is a lot harder than it may sound, but you have to start somewhere. Amsterdam-based Fairphone turned from an awareness campaign about conflict minerals into a phone company in 2013, and aims to source as many materials as possible in both human and environmentally kind ways.

Now in its third iteration, the £420 Fairphone 3 is making progress, not only in responsible sourcing of materials, but in manufacturing and longevity, with a modular, repairable design. It even comes with its own screwdriver.

There’s no two ways about it: the Fairphone 3 has a dated design. Big chunks of body at the top and bottom of the screen are reminiscent of smartphones from five years ago. The LCD display is fairly small by today’s standards at 5.7in, but is reasonable with pretty good colours and excellent viewing angles, and is just about bright enough – most of the time you’ll see the brightness cranked up to maximum. It’s covered by Gorilla Glass 5, which isn’t the latest, but at least should make it fairly scratch-resistant.

The rest of the body is utilitarian and boxy. At almost 1cm thick, the Fairphone 3 is certainly a chunky beast. The big chin and forehead, as well as fairly thick bezels each side of the screen, make the phone a lot larger than its small screen dimensions might suggest too. It’s closer in size to a phone with a screen over 6.4in, and so requires similar hand-stretching to use it.

The translucent black plastic body feels well made and hard-wearing. Being able to see the usually hidden components through the plastic makes it all the more interesting. There’s very little flex or give anywhere on the phone, which is all the more impressive give you can take the back off and remove modules.

The volume buttons and power button are all on the left side of the phone, which took some getting used to. The speaker, too, is mounted in the left side of the phone, which means you’re more likely to block it with an errant finger.

Through the back of the phone you can see the phrase “Change is in your hands” written on the battery, which is a little bit self-congratulatory for my tastes.

A USB-C socket in the bottom handles charging, while there is a (now rare) headphone socket in the top. There’s also a fingerprint scanner on the back, which works fairly well but is a bit high up the back to be easily reachable without moving the phone down your hand a little each time you need to touch it.

The Fairphone 3 won’t win any prizes for performance. It has Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 632 chip from last year, which is a lower-performance mid-range processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, plus a microSD card slot for adding more.

General performance isn’t terrible, but it certainly isn’t fast, even compared with mid-range smartphones costing less. There are elements of lag and stutter all over the system. You quickly run into slowdown when simply trying to find your way to a meeting, as launching the calendar app to find an address, then Google Maps and Citymapper to compare directions was enough to repeatedly introduce significant lag. Press a button and nothing happens long enough to make you question whether you managed to actually activate the button.

Battery life is equally middle of the road at about 26 hours between charges, meaning it lasts from 7am on day one until 9am on day two. That is while using the Fairphone 3 as my primary device with a total screen time of just over four hours, lots of email and messages, browsing in Chrome, four hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 40 minutes of offline Amazon Prime Video and a few photos.

The Fairphone 3 doesn’t ship with a charger or cable. It charges in about 2 hours 10 minutes using a standard 30W USB-C charger, or faster using one that supports Qualcomm’s QuickCharge 3 (€19.95 from Fairphone). But there’s also the possibility of just swapping in another charged battery, given you can remove it in less than five seconds.

The Fairphone 3 ships with its own Fairphone OS, which is a standard version of Android, free of bloat or duplicated apps and all the better for it. The only minor disappointment is that it ships on Android 9, not the new Android 10, although Fairphone aims to provide security and software updates for five years from release.

Anyone who has used Android in the last five years will be familiar with it, while switching to it from an iPhone is fairly straightforward. It’s clear that Fairphone needs to do a better job at optimising the performance of the software, however, as the issues of lag are likely to be avoidable with a bit of work.

The Fairphone 3 has a fairly standard 12-megapixel camera on the back, which is technically the same as that fitted to Google’s Pixel 3a, but doesn’t come anywhere close, lacking the software magic that makes Google’s camera so good.

In good lighting the Fairphone 3 shoots reasonable pictures with a solid amount of detail and colour. The same goes for selfies and portraits. Unfortunately that’s not the case in middling to low light conditions. Shots taken indoors at night with a mixture of overhead and lamp lighting produced dark, grainy and indistinct images.

Overall, the Fairphone 3’s camera performance is similar to today’s budget phones: fine on a sunny day, but poor indoors.

Other than efforts from the company to source materials ethically, and to pay the factory workers who put together the phone a top-up to a living wage, the most exciting thing about the Fairphone 3 is its modular nature. It’s not some Google Ara reinvention of the wheel, but rather the ability to take out and replace or repair parts when they go wrong.

Starting from the removable back and battery, the rest of the phone can be pulled apart with standard screws. Fairphone even includes the correct screwdriver in the box. If a part breaks, buy a replacement module, screw it in place and away you go. That’s the idea, anyway, and repair guide masters iFixit gave it a big thumbs up recently.

The individual parts aren’t that cheap, of course, but given you can place them yourself without breaking everything else in the process it seems like a fair trade-off. A replacement camera costs €49.95, the speaker €19.95, the bottom module with the USB-C socket in it costs €19.95 and the top module with the selfie camera, headphone socket and other bits costs €29.95. Probably more widely used parts are the screen for €89.95, the battery for €29.95 or the back cover for €24.95.
• None Fairphone includes a bumper case in the box that wraps the sides of the phone while leaving the back open
• None The vibration motor is strong but imprecise, feeling like one from four years ago
• None Bluetooth performance is poor, causing hiccups with headphones that are rock-solid with other devices
• None The Fairphone 3 is not water-resistant

The Fairphone 3 costs €450 direct, or £420 from the Phone Co-op, and is available for pre-order now delivering in mid-September. The Fairphone 3 is also available on Sky Mobile on contracts starting at £21 per month.

For comparison, Google’s Pixel 3a costs £399, the OnePlus 7 costs £499 and the Motorola Moto G7 costs £220.

The Fairphone 3 is a device full of compromises with one massive advantage: being ethical.

The design is a bit more interesting thanks to its translucent finish, but it’s chunky and dated-looking. The 5.7in screen is pretty good, but the big chin and bezels make the phone considerably larger and harder to use than it could be. It has USB-C and a headphone socket, both of which are welcome, but the odd speaker placement makes it easy to block.

The inside is the same. The clean, bloat-free Android software is good, but it’s only Android 9 not the new Android 10, and it has performance issues. Dual-sim and microSD card support is great too, but Bluetooth performance was pretty poor.

If you were to look at the Fairphone 3 simply as a £420 smartphone, you’d say it costs about £200 too much and isn’t even a great £220 phone at that. You can buy a phone with more modern design, similar specifications, performance and software for around £220 such as the Motorola Moto G7, or phones that are infinitely better at £420.

But the Fairphone 3 isn’t just another smartphone: it’s an entirely different way of thinking about how a phone and its creation fits into the world.

You can genuinely repair this phone yourself with modular components you simply unscrew and replace. If the battery is worn out, swap it out for a new one in less than 10 seconds. The Fairphone 3 is arguably the most sustainable phone you can buy, and that’s without even looking at the firm’s efforts to source all materials and manufacture the phone in as ethical manner as possible.

But I worry that a phone that has performance issues now won’t be serviceable in five years, and so all the reparability in the world won’t make it a device people still want to use in 2024. If buyers use the Fairphone 3 for two years, then dump it for a new one, that defeats the object of the exercise.

Until now it’s not been possible to put a real price on the ethical side of a smartphone in the same way you can with a Fairtrade chocolate bar. Thanks to the Fairphone 3, we now know it’s about £200. So the question is whether people are prepared to pay £200 extra to support a worthy movement. I hope they are.

26,Technology,iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro review roundup: buy the cheapest one,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/17/iphone-11-and-iphone-11-pro-review-roundup-buy-the-cheapest-one,2019-09-17T12:50:08Z,"The early reviews of Apple’s iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max are in from publications with early access to the three models.

While the iPhone 11 Pro is the most impressive technically, with a new triple camera system catching up to the competition, it is the iPhone 11, the cheapest of the bunch, that is winning the majority of people over. Questions remain as to whether it’s worth upgrading at all, however, if your iPhone is less than five years old.

The Guardian will have its own reviews of the new iPhones in the next week or so once they have gone on sale, but in the meantime here’s what those given early access by Apple had to say.

Costing from £729, the iPhone 11 has a 6.1in LCD screen, two cameras on the back but the same processor and storage sizes as the more expensive iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max.

Nilay Patel from the Verge praised the iPhone 11’s battery, but wasn’t so happy about the included charger:

In our tests, the iPhone 11 easily lasted a full day at a time and then some. It’s possible you could manage to kill this battery in less than a day, but you’d have to really try. The battery life is great, just like the iPhone XR’s battery life was great. What’s less great is the fact that Apple is still putting its ancient 5W charger in the box, even though the iPhone 11 Pro has an 18W USB-C fast charger. If Apple isn’t going to update the entire line to a fast charger, it should just do the environment a favour and stop putting the 5W charger in the box entirely; there are literally billions of them in the world, and odds are, you have more than one in a drawer already.

Britta O’Boyle and Stuart Miles from Pocket-lint said most will be happy with the LCD display of the iPhone 11, but corners had been cut:

In reality, the iPhone 11 has a display that will more than satisfy most users. It’s not as sharp in resolution as the likes of the iPhone 11 Pro, or the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 for example, and it doesn’t offer mobile HDR compatibility like these other devices either, but the iPhone 11 still offers a decent screen with ample brightness and arguably more realistic colours than the Pro models and other OLED smartphones. The omission of HDR on the iPhone 11 means that while it tries to deliver a HDR-like experience for compatible content, it’s not the real deal. Smart HDR pictures don’t pop as much when viewing on screen as they do on the iPhone 11 Pro, and you can’t see as much detail on a dark TV show or movie that’s available in HDR, as you can on the 11 Pro – but it’s also one of the few compromises the iPhone 11 makes to the Pro models.

The iPhone 11’s improved selfie camera now with slow-motion selfies was a magnet for Cnet’s Scott Stein’s kids:

The wider-angled front-facing camera is welcome, and digitally zooms in or out to accommodate a wider view that fits in more people and background. The 12-megapixel front-facing camera looks better, and I was happy with the results, but you have to be artful with the wider camera. Sometimes I ended up looking like a little face in a mountain of shirt. My kids instantly started messing around with slow-motion selfie feature. Yes, that’s the Slofie. It’s not a Live Photo, though. It’s just a video mode. That makes it hard to do much with, because the file sizes get large. I do, however, have a lot of extended 240-fps slow-motion scenes of my kids sticking out their tongues.

Wired’s Lauren Goode was impressed by the new dual camera on the iPhone 11:

This year’s iPhone 11 has two rear lenses, a wide-angle lens and an ultrawide lens with a 120-degree field of view. Last year’s iPhone XR had a single lens, and any depth effects added to photos were done computationally. This means the iPhone 11 now captures enough information to take better photos from the start – and especially portrait photos. Case in point: last year’s iPhone XR could capture a portrait photo of a person but not a pet or object. The iPhone 11 now takes portrait photos of my cat, which he is pleased about. Just kidding: he is indifferent, per usual. The iPhone 11 is a very good camera, and in a lot of situations it even performed better than last year’s top-of-the-line iPhone XS. But the iPhone 11 Pro takes noticeably better photos, whether standard photos, portrait images, or night mode pics.

Rhiannon Williams from the i predicts the splash of colour on the new iPhone 11 models will be a big draw, as the smartphone industry moves away from dull black and grey:

Like the XR and 5c series before it, a large part of the iPhone 11’s appeal lies in its range of six shades: red, black, white, yellow, green and purple. This is the first ever purple iPhone, and Apple has chosen the Instagram-baiting shade of lilac popularised by the likes of Ariana Grande and South Korean pop sensations BTS – Generation Z’s equivalent of millennial pink. It’s pretty – a stylish splash of lavender Apple knows will have aesthetically-minded iPhone owners clamouring to upgrade (as evidenced by its new range of transparent cases). These are phones to be shown off, not hidden behind rubber or leather sheaths, and even if you do cover it up with a case, Apple is banking on the satisfaction of owning a phone in a colour you’re attached to.

Gareth Beavis from TechRadar was won over by the iPhone 11:

Overall the iPhone 11 is a triumph for Apple – if, for nothing else, the fact it’s managed to lower the price year-on-year. We feel enough people are going to be won over by the hard-working camera … and the safety that buying a modern smartphone gives you. You should be able to achieve years of use from this phone, and sure, you could also consider the iPhone 11 Pro or iPhone 11 Pro Max if you want more power and higher spec, but we found the iPhone 11 to be fun to use and often outperformed what we would expect given the price – and that’s a feat some wouldn’t have expected from Apple.

Brian X Chen from the New York Times has a slightly different view, asking whether it’s still worth upgrading your iPhone every two years:

Based on my tests of the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, the answer is no. Don’t get me wrong: the newest models are nice. Apple has made them speedier, improved the cameras and lengthened their battery life. The new lineup also starts at a lower price of $700, down from $750 a year ago, which is a relief in an era of skyrocketing smartphone costs. But none of this is enough to warrant an immediate upgrade if you have had your smartphone for only two years. The latest iPhones just aren’t a big leap forward from last year’s iPhones or even the iPhone X from 2017. So here’s what I ultimately suggest: you should definitely upgrade if your current device is at least five years old. The iPhone 11 models are all a significant step up from those introduced in 2014. But for everyone else with smartphones from 2015 or later, there is no rush to buy. Instead, there is more mileage and value to be had out of the excellent smartphone you already own.

The £1,049 iPhone 11 Pro and £1,149 11 Pro Max top the iPhone 11 with higher resolution 5.8in and 6.5in OLED screens respectively. They also have a new triple camera system on the back – their main differentiator over the significantly cheaper model.

Patel was less complimentary about the battery life on the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. It’s better but not quite enough to prevent battery anxiety:

The iPhone 11 Pro Max I’ve been using every day for a week has consistently run for 12 to 14 hours on a single charge, with over 10 hours of screen-on time reported in the battery settings per 24-hour period. That’s compared to eight to 10 hours of battery life at most for my iPhone XS Max, which is a marked improvement. It’s not enough to make me stop charging at my desk throughout the day, and I’ll definitely still carry a battery pack on trips.

Williams could see the Super Retina XDR making an excellent screen better in a small but meaningful way:

Apple has chosen to stick to the same resolution as last year’s handsets but has spruced them up with a new OLED panel with a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio called Super Retina XDR. In practice, this means the displays are both bolder and brighter and display colours more accurately. I found this was best exemplified when examining skin tones in the same pictures side-by-side with the iPhone XS Max. Caucasian skin on the XS Max appears pinker and more flushed, whereas the same picture looks truer-to-life. Likewise, the 11 Pro Max picks out facial highlights and hair undertones not as apparent in the same picture over on the XS Max. It’s a small difference, but an impressive one.

Stein says there are essentially two reasons to pick the iPhone 11 Pro Max over the smaller 11 Pro:

This year’s most expensive iPhone is the $1,449 (£1,499) iPhone Pro Max with 512GB of storage. Even with 256GB of storage – the minimum you’ll likely want for a high-end phone like this – it will set you back $1,249 (£1,299). There are two main reasons to go for this year’s most extreme iPhone: either you want that larger OLED display (2,688×1,242 versus 2,436×1,125 for the Pro) or you want that extra hour of battery life. I wouldn’t want to spend this much. But if you really are using your phone as a professional camera and you want to see every pixel, you want the best viewfinder and editing display you can get. And, well, this would be that phone. It’s also more fun for movies and games, but at these prices, I’d just buy a separate iPad for that.

Beavis felt that the expense of the iPhone 11 Pro was difficult to justify:

Overall, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is a real step forward, and the most advanced iPhone yet. However, when thinking about what’s truly new here, we weren’t able to single out much beyond the improved camera (especially night mode) and the slightly upgraded cinematic experience. If you want to save some money, we’d suggest checking out the iPhone 11 – while we constantly found little nuggets of impressive performance throughout our testing of the 11 Pro Max, we couldn’t shake the feeling that this is really only a phone for the Apple fan who wants the best of everything, with no compromises.

Goode found the all-important camera on the iPhone 11 Pro Max to be a mixed bag:

While Apple says frequently that its integrated hardware and software enable it to do magical things with cameras – and in some cases, that’s true – that doesn’t mean every shot taken on the iPhone 11 Pro phones was the best photo. In some cases, the photos I took on the iPhone 11 Pro Max were clearly sharper, brighter, and even more (you hate to say it) professional-looking than the iPhone 11 photos of the same scenes or subjects. The iPhone 11 Pro Max captured the best portrait mode photo of my colleague Lydia, showing accurate colours, picking up on details like wisps of hair and freckles, and handling highlights and sunlight well. A beach sunset photo captured on the same phone expertly captured the contrast between dark rocks, a glassy ocean and the sunburnt sky. A photo of yaki onigiri captured in harsh overhead light showed excellent detail, right down to the charred rice. But when pitted against other leading smartphones, the iPhone 11 Pro Max wasn’t always the standout. The Google Pixel 3, a less expensive and soon-to-be-outdated phone, took better, crisper photos of a floral arrangement in a very dark bar. An iPhone 11 Pro Max photo of my friend Kayla, captured in a dark sushi restaurant, showed a lot of detail in easy-to-miss spots like her hands, or the slight wrinkles of her shirt. But Kayla, a video producer, and I both agreed that the colour and temperature of the photo was off, whereas the Pixel 3’s photo was more true-to-life.

27,Technology,"Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 review: less business, more modern design",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/16/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-review-less-business-more-modern-design,2019-09-16T06:00:48Z,"Bose’s new top-of-the range 700 noise-cancelling headphones attempt to be the new gold standard, with a new design, new technology and a shift in focus.

Launched to sit atop the long-standing kings of noise-cancelling cans, the £300 QuietComfort 35 II, the new £350 Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 look to shift Bose’s rather staid image toward something more modern and fashionable.

Out goes the segmented headband and folding arms, and in comes a slimmer, seamless metal band terminating in two arms that slide smoothly through the outside of the ear cups for height adjustment.

It’s a sleeker design that removes harsh lines, junctions and breaks. Even the bunching of the ear pads has been smoothed out. The shape of the ear cups forces the headband, which is lined with a soft-touch silicone pad, to sit further back on your head. Wear them too far forward and they’ll slide off.

And they no longer fold in half. Instead the ear cups simply rotate, fitting into a wedge-shaped case, which Bose says is thinner at one end than the QC35 II’s and therefore easier to fit into a flight bag. But not folding means they are harder squeeze into an every-day bag without the case. A small step back in my opinion.

On the head they feel slightly heavier than the QC35 II. The ear pads are slimmer and the ear cups feel more airy, which helped keep my ears cooler, but they grip the sides of my head noticeably harder. They were comfortable for extended periods, but they didn’t feel as immediately snug and relaxed as the QC35.

The controls have been redesigned too. Two buttons on the right take care of power, pairing and voice assistant control – Google Assistant, Alexa or Siri - with advanced Google Assistant or Alexa functionality baked-in if you’d like.

A button on the left ear cup controls the noise-cancelling level. Press and hold to activate conversation mode, which pipes in sound from outside so you can talk to someone – although you look exceptionally rude doing so.

The new touch controls are the best I’ve used on any headphones, and worked reliably even in inclement weather, but not at all with non touch-enabled gloves. Double tap the Bose logo on the right ear cup to pause or play. Swipe forward or back for track skip, and up and down to adjust volume. Seven full swipes takes you from minimum to maximum volume with a continual progression in between.

Connectivity was rock solid to phones and tablets, both Android and iOS. The headphones support Bluetooth 5, but only the SBC and AAC audio codecs. That’s fine for Apple users, because AAC is the highest quality an iPhone or iPad can support, but Android or Windows PC users looking for more advanced formats such as Qualcomm’s aptX series or Sony’s LDAC will have to look elsewhere.

Audio latency control was good, with audio and video perfectly in sync with all the major video apps and services, including the often problematic YouTube. Games showed a little bit of audio delay.

The Headphones 700 can also connect to two devices at once, which means you can watch a video on an iPad and then take a call on your phone or similar. It worked great with mobile devices, but connecting them to a computer and a phone simultaneously caused audio issues.

You can pair lots of devices and hot swap between them using the Bose Music app or you can simply disconnect and reconnect your devices manually using their Bluetooth settings.

The original QC35 pushed noise-cancelling technology to the next level and the Headphones 700 match them, competing favourably with Sony’s best, particularly on commutes, handling wind noise better than any other. Turned up to maximum, the noise cancelling is very effective, blocking or diminishing even the most difficult of sudden or loud noises. The difference between the Headphones 700 and even mid-range models is night and day. You get what you pay for.

Bose has re-engineered its noise-cancelling system for greater flexibility. Now you can choose from 11 levels from maximum noise blocking to fully open, piping ambient sounds from your environment into the headphones using the microphones on their surface.

That means if you want some awareness of what’s happening around you, such as conversations in an office, but without the hum of air conditioning or computers you can adjust the level accordingly. The ambient sound mode is a cut above too, sounding far more natural and open than any other similar technology I’ve used.

Press the noise-cancelling button on the left ear cup to switch between three favourite noise-cancelling levels, which default to zero, five and 10. Every time you switch levels or in and out of conversation mode, the noise-cancelling ramps smoothly up and down again like someone turning a big analogue volume knob. It’s a small detail that makes the whole experience feel all the more luxurious.

Bose products always have a signature sound that has proven divisive in audiophile circles. The Headphones 700 are no different. If you didn’t like how the QC35 or even the original TriPort headphones sounded, you won’t like these.

If you do, then you’ll be treated to well-balanced audio with punch in the low end for a fully rounded sound and clarity in the highs to make tracks sparkle. You’ll also hear an almost clinical separation of tones, which allows individual instruments and notes to stand boldly on their own, not blended into a mush.

The Headphones 700 can handle most music genres well, with an easy listening and open sound that’s slightly more spacious than the QC35. Overall they are some of the most consistent and best-sounding headphones you can buy, right up their with Sony’s MX-1000M3.

There is no equaliser control yet, but Bose said it was working on the ability to adjust the sound of the headphones as part of its new architecture.

Voice calling, as well as voice assistant access, is a new focus for the Bose headphones. Using a series of microphones they perform a similar beam-forming noise cancellation on your voice as smart speakers. The result is clear and loud voice pickup even in the noisiest of environments. If you make a lot of calls or talk to Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri all the time these are for you.

The Headphones 700 last just shy of 20 hours between charges when using Bluetooth and noise cancelling turned up to maximum, but longer when used via cable. While not industry leading, given Sony’s MX-1000M3 last in the region of 30 hours. That’s long enough to last a week’s commuting or a transatlantic flight.

It takes just under 2.5 hours to charge them via USB-C, which is fairly slow compared to the fast-charging smartphone. A 15-minute quick charge provides over three hours of playback time though, which is handy if you forget to charge them.
• None There’s a strum on a double bass when you turn them on, which I found annoyingly loud in quiet environments
• None Occasionally it took several attempts to get the Bose Music app to connect to the headphones
• None You can independently adjust the volume on the headphones when using the wired connection, handy for use as a gaming headset or with a headphones splitter sharing a tablet
• None The case has a small pouch inside that holds the USB-C and analogue headphones cable
• None Bose no longer supplies an aeroplane headphones adapter in the box, but you probably don’t need one anymore

The Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 cost £349.95 and are available in black or silver.

For comparison, the RRP for the Bose QuietComfort 35 II is £300 (currently £260), Sony’s WH-1000XM3 cost £329, Beats Studio 3 Wireless cost £300, with cheaper models such as Lindy’s BNX-60 starting around £90.

The Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 mark a shift for the company, attempting to diverge from a perception of being bought by business travellers towards a design-led luxury offering with a £350 price tag to match.

They’re certainly sleeker and more expensive-looking. The way they operate is smoother too, whether it’s the fading and in and out of sound modes or the best-in-class swipe touch controls.

They are also the best-sounding Bose headphones to date, with a consistent refined performance. Audiophiles may still be put off by the Bose sound signature. Noise cancelling is top notch, but now adaptable with a sliding scale of levels available, and voice calling or voice assistant control is best-in-class. If you make calls or talk to Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri a lot, these are for you.

But part of the seamless design is the removal of folding arms. The ear cups still rotate to flat, but the headphones are harder to fit into a general commuting bag than the QC35. The ear cups feel more spacious and cooler when wearing, but the headband squeezes your head noticeably harder than the QC35, and as a result weren’t quite as comfortable. They are still more comfortable for extended periods than key competition though.

The Headphones 700 support Bluetooth 5 for better connectivity, can connect to two devices at once, which is extremely handy, but they struggle connecting to both a computer and a smartphone. Hopefully an update can solve those problems, but stick to mobile devices for now and everything works fine.

The lack of higher quality or low-latency Bluetooth audio formats beyond SBC and AAC is slightly disappointing for non-Apple users, and while battery life is solid at just shy of 20 hours, it’s not class leading.

They’re pricey, but the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are some of the best headphones you can buy. They just don’t quite transform the market in the same way the original QC35s managed in 2016.

28,Technology,Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ review:  bigger and now with a magic wand,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/12/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review-bigger-and-now-with-a-magic-wand,2019-09-12T06:00:51Z,"The king of Samsung smartphones has finally arrived, but is the Galaxy Note 10+ and its S-Pen stylus really still the super phone for super fans of the South Korean brand?

For a long time the Galaxy Note line was used to push the boundaries of what could be done with a smartphone, siring the big-screen “phablet” category in the process. I’m sad to report that’s no longer the case. The £999 Note 10+ might technically be the biggest screen on a Samsung flagship phone, but it’s really only by a smidgen.

Underneath the glass and metal body the Note 10+ is essentially a Galaxy S10+ from March. That’s not a bad thing, as the S10+ is a very good phone, but it means that the Note 10+ is no longer the specs monster it was. If you always bought the Note because it was “the best Samsung” your decision is no longer that clear cut.

What you get is a slight change of design. The striking 6.8in QHD+ AMOLED screen is enormous, but it’s actually only 0.1in bigger than the one in the S10 5G. Still it’s gorgeous to look at, videos look particularly great, and the hole cut in the top for the selfie camera is smaller than any other. But it’s not as smooth nor impressive as the notchless (Samsung made) 90Hz AMOLED screen on the OnePlus 7 Pro.

The Note 10+ has stereo speakers, which are surprisingly good – all the more so because the top one projects its sound out of a nearly imperceivable gap at the top of the screen,.

The build quality is exceptional. The phone is thin, feels lighter than it is at 196g and the glass front and back curve at the edges to a thin metal band with squared-off ends at the top and bottom. There’s absolutely no give anywhere, making the Note 10+ feel the closest yet to that all-glass slab of a phone we’ve been promised in sci-fi for a decade.

But those squared-off ends, harder corners and giant screen make the Note 10+ harder to use one-handed than any other phone. This is decidedly a two-hand phone. Use it one-handed without an aid at your peril. If ever there was a phone that should have shipped with one of those lanyards of old, this is it.

I also got a lot of accidental touches from my palm on the bottom right of the screen. Accidentally zooming into web pages, exciting apps when trying to reach something and even pausing the music when trying to scroll in Spotify was a regular occurrence. Taking photos without hitting the back or home button was particularly difficult, resulting in quite a few missed photos.

The Note 10+ comes with the same processor as the S10+ in the US (Qualcomm Snapdragon 855) and a slightly updated one (Exynos 9825) with the same performance but marginally improved energy efficiency in Europe. It also has 4GB more RAM at 12GB total (which is a bit of overkill).

One big difference is the use of the newer UFS3.0 storage technology, which makes the 256GB of built-in storage significantly faster than that used in the Galaxy S10+ (and most other phones, except the OnePlus 7 Pro and a handful of others).

As such the Note 10+ is a very powerful phone on paper, but it doesn’t feel any faster in use than an S10+, and certainly not as snappy or fluid as the OnePlus 7 Pro.

Battery life on the Galaxy Note 10+ is good, lasting more than 32 hours between charges on average with reasonably heavy usage. With the screen on in excess of five hours and set to FHD+ with the always-on display (AOD) setting off, the phone lasts from 7am on day one until after 3pm on day two. That is while browsing and using apps for four hours with a hundred or so push messages, watching 40 minutes of Netflix, shooting about 10 photos a day and listening to around five hours of music via Bluetooth headphones.

Lighter usage sees the battery last another few hours, as did activating one of the many battery-saving modes. The Note 10+ has wireless charging and powershare (for charging headphones and other devices from the back), but has faster cabled charging than previous Samsung phones. From completely flat the battery reaches 80% charge in 40 minutes with the included 25W charger. The Note 10+ can charge up to 45W, but requires a special charger that supports Power Delivery 3.0 with PPS and isn’t included in the box.

The Galaxy S10 line was the first to launch with Samsung’s revamped version of Android called One UI, which is based on 2018’s Android 9, not the recently launched Android 10.

Most of the customisations Samsung makes to Android are welcome, with a focus on using the bottom of the screen for things you have to touch and the top for information, which aids in using phones with large screens.

However, it’s held back by the use of the old Android navigation keys or swipe pads in their place, instead of the more modern gesture control used by other manufacturers such as Huawei and OnePlus or the ones now baked into Android 10. It’s very difficult to reach the bottom left corner with your right thumb or bottom right with your left for the navigation keys on this size of screen.

Different for the Note 10+ is the addition of S-Pen features for drawing on the screen and accessing various apps from pop-out menus. New for this year on the S-Pen is greatly improved handwriting recognition in the Samsung Notes app, which was thoroughly impressive accurately translating even scrawl into pristine text, and what Samsung calls Air actions.

Last year Samsung added remote control functionality to the S-Pen; this year that includes using the stylus like a magic wand for gestures in mid-air. You can change tracks, change cameras and take photos, and generally navigate or activate features using swipes and twirls of the S-Pen. It’s fairly impressive, but after a brief play around I found it simply easier to press a button on the screen, apart from taking photos with the phone mounted in a tripod, which I have done precisely once to see whether it would work.

The S-Pen remains one of the best styluses available, and slots neatly into the body of the Note 10+ when not in use. If you never use it, the S-Pen doesn’t get in the way at all, but it is essentially the reason to buy the Note 10+.

The Note 10+ has the same ultrasonic fingerprint scanner embedded under the screen as the S10+. When it works it’s great. It doesn’t feel fast, but appears to unlock faster than Samsung’s software is set up to react, giving rise to a sluggish response, particularly in comparison to the OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro’s excellent optical in-screen fingerprint sensor.

However, it is the Note 10+’s inconsistency which is extremely annoying. About one in five times it simply refuses to work, which always happens to be when you’re in a hurry. Others have proven that in-screen fingerprint sensors can be as fast and accurate as traditional ones on the front or back, but Samsung’s isn’t as good.

The Note 10+ has a triple rear camera system that’s aided by a new depth sensor, which enhances portrait mode shots and other depth effects, including for video.

The main 12-megapixel camera is joined by a 12-megapixel telephoto (2x optical zoom) camera and a 16-megapixel ultrawide angle camera, which is one of the best in the business. Together they allow lossless zoom from 0.5 to 2x, and on to a 10x hybrid zoom.

The Note 10+ therefore has one of the better cameras available taking shots with an excellent amount of detail and generally good exposure and colour. It falls down in low light and zoom capabilities next to the Huawei P30 Pro. Samsung’s night mode doesn’t match Google’s for the Pixel either.

Video capture quality is top notch at up to 4K at 60fps, and can now do live focus effects similar to Samsung’s still images, but in real time. Samsung’s new AR Doodle lets you draw on your or someone else’s face in real-time too with the S-Pen, which your kids will love.

The selfie camera was a bit of a let down, taking fairly good photos outdoors in good lighting, but struggling indoors and at events, where a crappy photo can’t be taken again.
• None The stereo speakers are really good
• None The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is incompatible with most screen protectors, but a compatible one comes included in the box
• None Haptic feedback (vibrations) are the best yet on a Samsung phone
• None A little pop-up when you take the S-Pen out of the slot shows you the gestures you can use in the current app or that they won’t work here, which is handy
• None You can hook it up to a PC or just a screen/mouse/keyboard to use the Note 10+ as a computer
• None The power button has been moved to the left side next to the volume buttons, which took a little getting used to, and by default it can activate Bixby rather than fully power-off the phone

The Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ costs £999 with 4G and 256GB of storage, £1,099 with 5G and 256GB of storage or £1,199 with 5G and 512GB of storage in either black or aura glow.

For comparison, the recommended retail prices of the competition are now £799 for the Galaxy S10+ with 128GB of storage, £1,099 for the 256GB Galaxy S10 5G, the 128GB Huawei P30 Pro is £799, the 64GB Google Pixel 3 XL costs £869, the 64GB iPhone XS Max costs £1,099, and the 256GB OnePlus 7 Pro costs £699.

The Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is some piece of hardware. An enormous screen and a feeling of solid glass seems simply futuristic. But that giant screen is also its downfall - it’s just too big to use with one hand.

It’s also plagued with accidental touches, which are downright irritating. A case will probably solve those, but make the phone bigger and less sleek in the process.

The phone performs well, has solid battery life, the screen looks great and Samsung’s new aura glow colour option is interesting. But where the old Notes used to be the pinnacle of everything Samsung could achieve in a phone that year, the S10+ offers practically everything the Note does minus the S-Pen and for at least £200 cheaper.

So the reason the Note still exists is for those who love the productivity and fun of the stylus, which Samsung has only added to with the wand-like S-Pen Air gestures. Note fans will love it. But for everyone else, the S10+ is probably the better Samsung phone, while the competition from the likes of OnePlus and Huawei is exceedingly strong.

29,Technology,iPhone 11: Apple launches new Pro smartphones with better cameras,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/10/iphone-11-apple-launches-new-pro-smartphones-with-better-cameras,2019-09-10T19:04:55Z,"Apple has launched its latest iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max featuring new cameras, improved screens, faster processors and longer battery life.

Announced at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California on Tuesday, the iPhone 11 series of smartphones carries on where the iPhone XS, XS Max and XR left off last year.

The new iPhones feature similar designs and screen sizes with slim bezels and the Face ID notch at the top, which was first introduced in 2017 with the iPhone X. A variety of new colours will also be available, with a new matt finish on the back of the iPhone 11 Pro.

The iPhone Pro will be available in two sizes, with either a 5.8-inch (147mm) or 6.5-inch (165mm) screen. The improved Super Retina XDR OLED displays have a higher resolution, are brighter and have better colour, and are more efficient on battery.

The big new addition for this year’s iPhone is a square lump on the back, which contains a triple camera system for the iPhone 11 Pro. The three 12-megapixel cameras work together in a similar way to the dual-camera system of the previous iPhones, combining an ultra-wide angle, a main and a telephoto camera for zooming from 0.5x to 2x, similar to rivals’ products.

Apple said it paired all three cameras for colour and exposure in the factory, pushing the iPhone as a film-making system for both shooting and editing video.

The new cameras also offer better low-light performance with a new night mode – a current pain point for consumers – as seen in rival phones. Apple says the phones also produce better all-round, more detailed images using advanced computational photography, and that its new HDR system allows superior lighting.

Apple also upgraded the TrueDepth selfie camera to 12 megapixels, enabling wider photos and shooting up to 4K at 60 frames per second. The selfie camera can also now shoot slow-motion video.

Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said: “For those that want something that truly pushes the limits, this is the iPhone 11 Pro. The most powerful and advanced iPhones we’ve ever produced in a stunning new design.”

The 6.1-inch iPhone 11 – the direct replacement for the iPhone XR – gains a dual-camera version of Apple’s new system, supplanting the single camera from last year and adding a 12-megapixel ultra wide-angle camera to the traditional 12-megapixel camera.

The new cheaper iPhone can also capture video from both cameras at up to 4K at 60 frames per second. Apple claimed it shoots the highest quality video in a smartphone, apart from the iPhone 11 Pro.

The iPhone 11 has the same 6.1-inch LCD as the iPhone XR, and the same aluminium and glass build, but now with tougher glass.

All the new iPhones also have the new, faster A13 Bionic chip, which Apple says is both the fastest CPU and GPU in a smartphone ever.

Apple said the battery on the iPhone 11 was capable of lasting one hour longer than the iPhone XR, which was already the longest-lasting iPhone in the firm’s history. It said the iPhone 11 Pro would last four hours longer than the iPhone XS, and the iPhone 11 Pro Max five hours longer than the iPhone XS Max.

Both iPhone 11 Pros also ship with a faster 18W charger in the box, something others have been doing for years.

Apple has also improved its Face ID facial recognition system, implemented the new wifi 6 standard and faster wireless charging.

One big missing feature for the iPhone is support for the latest 5G networks, which recently launched in the UK, US and elsewhere. While the availability of the new significantly faster mobile networks is limited at the moment, the rollout is expected to reach many major towns and cities by the end of 2019.

Samsung, OnePlus and other predominantly Chinese smartphone manufacturers all have at least one 5G model on sale, giving them a significant advantage in the new era of mobile connectivity.

Last year’s iPhone revision ditched the old-style design with home button for the iPhone X-like screen, adding the larger, but cheaper 6.1-inch iPhone XR and 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max at the top end. But from launch until the end of June, that range of iPhones sold 26% fewer handsets globally than the iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus the previous year, according to data from Canalys, with three straight quarters of shipment decline.

With a trade war between the US and China likely to affect Apple’s growth in the Chinese market, and potentially increasing the cost of the iPhone elsewhere thanks to tariffs, the next few years may prove difficult. Apple will be banking on the top-end appeal of its most expensive iPhone 11 Pro to continue where the iPhone XS Max left off, while the cheaper iPhone 11 appeals to a wider market by competing more directly on price with the likes of Samsung.

The iPhone 11 will cost $699 in the US (£729 in the UK, A$1,199 in Australia), $50 less than the iPhone XR from last year. The iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max will cost from $999 (£1,049 in the UK, A$1,749 in Australia) and $1,099 (£1,149 in the UK, A$1,899 in Australia), and will ship on 20 September.

30,Television & radio,Little Mix's Jesy Nelson on surviving the trolls: 'People were saying horrific things',https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/08/little-mixs-jesy-nelson-on-surviving-the-trolls-people-were-saying-horrific-things,2019-09-08T16:00:46Z,"When Jesy Nelson was 19 and working behind the bar at a pub in Dagenham, Essex, she remembers watching The X Factor on TV, and thinking: “I know I could win that.” In 2011, she did just that, as part of the girl group Little Mix – and thought: “This is the worst day of my life.”

Competing in Simon Cowell’s singing contest unleashed ceaseless criticism of her appearance and weight (although rarely her voice). “All I cared about was what people were saying about me,” she says now.

Winning offered no respite. When Little Mix were crowned, the first Facebook message she saw was from a stranger. It read: “You are the ugliest thing I have ever seen in my life. You do not deserve to be in this girl band, you deserve to die.”

“I should have been on cloud nine,” she says. “I had Leigh-Anne [Pinnock, also of Little Mix] in my room being like: ‘This is the best!’ and I was like: ‘No, this isn’t.’”

Little Mix went on to become the biggest British girl group since the Spice Girls, but Nelson was consumed by the trolling and abuse on social media. Within two years of the finale, she had depression and an eating disorder and had attempted suicide.

The downward spiral and her eventual, slow recovery are the focus of an intensely personal BBC Three documentary, Jesy Nelson: Odd One Out. Before shooting it, she says, she had never spoken publicly about her struggles in the spotlight.

When we meet in a corner of BBC Broadcasting House in central London, Nelson, now 28, is friendly and glamorous, dressed in a double-breasted tangerine suit. It is the eighth anniversary of her X Factor debut and #8YearsofLittleMix has been trending on Twitter all morning, thanks to their fans, the “Mixers”.

Within minutes of sitting down, she says that, had she known the consequences of appearing on The X Factor, she wouldn’t have done it: “I don’t think anything is worth your happiness, and it was a lot of my life that I won’t get back.”

As a child growing up in Romford, Essex, Nelson was intent on becoming a performer, be it singing, dancing or acting. “I didn’t really have any reason to not be confident,” she says.

In mid-2011, she auditioned for The X Factor as a solo entrant, and was eventually placed in a group with three others: Pinnock, Perrie Edwards and Jade Thirlwall, all aged between 18 and 20.

Back then, social media was not as inextricably linked with reality TV as it is now. In fact, that eighth series was the first where applicants could upload their audition videos to YouTube; Nelson didn’t even know what YouTube was. She remembers being wowed when all the contestants were given new Samsung phones and told to get on Twitter to build their fanbase.

On the first live show 12 weeks in, Little Mix (then Rhythmix – the name was changed later) performed Nicki Minaj’s Super Bass to gushing praise from judges Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow and their mentor Tulisa Contostavlos. It was “the best feeling in the world”, said Nelson through happy tears on stage.

That night, off-camera, the contestants gathered to watch themselves on YouTube. Someone pointed out the comment section. “I was very naive,” says Nelson. “I thought it would be people giving their opinion on our performance. But nearly every comment was about the way I looked: ‘She’s a fat ugly rat’; ‘How has she got in this girl group?’; ‘How is the fat one in this?’” She remembers the air being thick with tension – “because no one knew what to do or how to react”.

“I felt a rush of anxiety, because I’d never experienced anything like that in my life. People were saying my face was deformed – just the most horrific things. I felt like I was heartbroken. I remember ringing my mum and saying: ‘Mum, I want to go home, I don’t want to do it.’”

At about 1am, a member of The X Factor team found Nelson crying alone and asked why she was so upset. A couple of days later, she was asked to explain again – on camera. She didn’t want to do it. “They told me it wasn’t recorded, and it was.”

A few weeks later, the clip of Nelson in tears over “a few nasty comments” was broadcast before Little Mix’s performance, the reality TV playbook of “sad piano” switching to upbeat pop music when Thirlwall comforts her: an uplifting moment of girl power. From then on, that was Nelson’s public narrative.

She does not hold that clip, or the producers, responsible: “I think it would have always happened – that just added fuel to the fire.” From the start, relatability had been billed as a central tenet of Little Mix’s appeal. Contostavlos introduced them as “the girl group to represent ladies in this country”; she framed Nelson’s tears as evidence of Little Mix having “the same insecurities as every other girl”.

Nelson, however, was the only member even remotely close to the average UK woman at size 16. Although the four bandmates have always been friends – “that’s why we’re still together” – she felt singled out. “I was with three other girls to be compared to. I don’t think it would have been as bad if I’d been on my own.”

After the clip presented her as Little Mix’s weakest link, the abuse snowballed. “It was like as soon as people knew that it was really affecting me, they wanted to do it more.” Nelson had been bullied at school, to the point of stress-induced alopecia – “but this wasn’t playground stuff”.

She was shocked by the cruelty from adults – some clearly parents. “Obviously everyone sits in their living room and will see someone on TV and make a comment. But to actually pick up your phone and go: ‘I’m going to make sure this girl sees it’ – even if they didn’t think I was going to see it – you have no idea the effect that one comment will have.”

Nelson became “obsessed” with reading criticism. The praise didn’t register. “It only got worse when I got Twitter. And that led to the Daily Mail, and reading the [below the line] comments – the worst you can read about yourself. It was like I purposely wanted to hurt myself.”

“I had a routine of waking up, going on Twitter, searching for the worst things I could about myself. I’d type in the search bar: ‘Jesy fat’, or ‘Jesy ugly’, and see what would come up. Sometimes I didn’t even need to do that, I’d just write ‘Jesy’ and then I’d see all the horrible things. Everyone told me to ignore it – but it was like an addiction.”

At one event, Nicola Roberts of Girls Aloud – who had seen the clip of her crying – took Nelson aside. “She said: ‘Can I just give you one bit of advice? Please don’t read stuff about you. It’s the worst thing you could do.’”

Contestants had been told help was available if they were struggling, but Nelson had learned that talking only made the problem worse. “I don’t think any of the team really knew how upset it was making me – it’s just go-go-go, from the car into hair and makeup, then rehearsals.”

It was also a popularity contest. “We just wanted to make everyone happy, and we wanted everyone to like us.”

In December 2011, Little Mix became the first group to win The X Factor. Their debut single entered the charts at No 1 seven months later; DNA, their first album, was released in November 2012. Scrutiny of Nelson only increased amid the pressure to maintain momentum.

Although she tried not to discuss it, she feels the abuse came to define her public image. “I’d become a bit of a joke. People would make memes, chopping my head off in a group photo and putting a monster or ET on there. I’d be in live Q&As and these things would pop up and I’d have to just sit there.”

Interviewers asked her how she dealt with it; fans said they looked up to her. She was depressed and in denial: she refused antidepressants, and therapy didn’t help. “Our schedule was so gruelling. I was going to see a therapist at six o’clock in the morning, crying, and then going to a photoshoot.”

Meanwhile, in public, she was “giving speeches about being confident”. Little Mix, as the guardians of girl power, were not only supposed to represent every woman, but defend every woman.

“I felt I had to be this person who was like …” Nelson juts her jaw, sashays from side to side, a facsimile of her sassy music-video persona: “‘I don’t care what people are saying about me, I’m this strong woman.’ That was the role I had to take on in the group, when really I was an absolute mess.”

In the lead-up to TV performances or video shoots: “I’d starve myself … I’d drink Diet Coke for a solid four days and then, when I felt a bit dizzy, I’d eat a pack of ham because I knew it had no calories. Then I’d binge eat, then hate myself.”

Yet she did not see herself as having an eating disorder. “I could see that I was losing weight and sometimes I’d see a few good comments and that spiralled me to be like: ‘This is how I need to stay.’ No one cares whether your performance was good, or if you sounded great.”

Nelson started skipping events where she knew she would be photographed. On one magazine shoot, the wrong size clothes were provided. “I had a meltdown. I cried so much, I had to wear sunglasses. I did one photo, then left.” She hid her misery well, she says now. “I think people just thought I was a miserable bitch.”

Her lowest point was in the lead-up to Little Mix’s second album, Salute, in 2013. Her mum, Janice, increasingly desperate, told her she had to quit the band. Yet Nelson worried that leaving – or even taking a break – would draw more attention to herself. “Everyone’s going to ask why.”

In November 2013, Little Mix returned to The X Factor to perform their new single, Nelson notably slimmed down. Coverage centred on one tweet from Katie Hopkins: “Packet Mix have still got a chubber in their ranks. Less Little Mix. More Pick n Mix.”

Increasingly, Nelson felt trapped. “I felt that I physically couldn’t tolerate the pain any more.” She attempted suicide.

Nelson’s family, her management and the rest of the group knew – but “once it was spoken about, it wasn’t ever spoken about again”, she says. She was offered time off, but once more was too frightened of drawing attention to herself to take it.

The turning point came in February 2014, when Little Mix spent six weeks travelling across North America, opening for Demi Lovato. One day, on the bus, the dancers pulled her aside and told her she had to quit Twitter, likening it to a book filled with “loads of nasty things” that Nelson always had her nose in. She finally deleted her account.

“It was a long, hard process, because I didn’t want to help myself. But it wasn’t until I deleted Twitter that everything changed for me and I slowly started to feel normal again.” Through more regular therapy and talking to friends and family, eventually she was able to stop reading articles about herself, and distance herself from her public image even as Little Mix’s star continued to climb. In 2016, Glory Days became their first No 1 album in the UK.

Since February, Nelson has been dating the 2017 Love Island contestant Chris Hughes, who has defended her publicly from online trolling and who she says is a positive influence on her feelings about fame: “It’s nice to be around someone who doesn’t give a shit about all that stuff.”

Making the documentary also contributed; she lights up while talking about meeting a body-image specialist, Liz Ritchie, to help her understand her relationship with social media and the “mask” that she had developed to withstand the spotlight. Part of this involved going over footage from The X Factor, which was a difficult experience, but ultimately empowering.

“Don’t get me wrong, I still have days when I feel shit in myself but instead of beating myself up about it and being miserable, I think: ‘OK, I’m going to have my moment of being sad, and I’ll be over it.’ Before, I didn’t let myself be sad.”

Talking to other young people who have experienced online abuse made her feel less alone. “A lot of people think ‘stop moaning’, but until you’ve experienced it, it’s hard to understand – and it doesn’t just happen to people in the limelight. There’s so many people struggling with social media and online trolling. People need to know about the effects it has.”

The turnaround in five years, she agrees, is remarkable: now, as Little Mix work on their sixth album, Nelson is less conscious of her weight, her appearance, what she’s eating – even what is being said about her. To shoot the documentary, she returned to Twitter, and discovered some new slurs. “I didn’t even know some people said that about me, but it’s because I don’t look for it – and also, I. Don’t. Care,” she says, leaning forward in her chair.

“Now I’m mentally a lot happier, I just think people are always going to have an opinion. But I only care about mine.” She flashes a smile from beneath all her hair, happy but defiant – and for a moment she looks exactly like the girl in the music videos.

Jesy Nelson: Odd One Out will be available on 12 September from 10am on BBC Three on iPlayer and on BBC One at 9pm.

32,Technology,Android 10 released: everything you need to know about Google's update,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/04/android-10-released-everything-you-need-to-know-about-google-update,2019-09-04T11:15:55Z,"Google has released its big new update to Android 10, and for the first time it is available for more than just a couple of Google-made smartphones.

Announced in May, Android Q – known as Android 10 – ditches the pudding-based names that have been used for versions of Google’s software for the past 10 years including Marshmallow, Nougat, Oreo and Pie.

But that’s not the only modernising shift in Android 10. Here’s everything you need to know.

When can I get it?

If you have a Google Pixel phone, simply check for updates in the system settings to download it over the next couple of days – or head to Google’s developer site if you are impatient.

Unusually for Android, other manufacturers have joined the early release schedule. A full Android 10 update is available for the Essential Phone globally and the Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro in China and India. Meanwhile, OnePlus has released Android 10 for the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro in “open beta”, which is part of the firm’s long-running early access software series.

Many other manufacturers are still running developer previews of Android 10 and are expected to release full versions soon. One of the biggest exceptions is Samsung, which is not expected to release Android 10 for at least a few months.

How much will it cost?

The update from Google and other manufacturers is free. If you are asked to pay to update it is likely to be a scam.

Will all my apps work?

The majority of the apps on your phone will work as normal. Some may need small updates for full compatibility, but many of those apps have already received the necessary updates including from companies such as Samsung for support of its smartphone accessories on other company’s phones.

Google has introduced a new gesture navigation system as part of Android 10, which sits alongside the traditional three-button and Google’s Android 9 Pie two-button navigation options.

The new navigation gestures are a blend of those used by Apple on its iPhone X, XS and XR lines and those deployed by manufacturers such as Huawei and OnePlus.

There is a new thin gesture bar at the bottom of the screen. Swiping up on it goes home, up and hold shows recently used apps; swiping left or right on the bar switches directly between the last-used apps. The back button has been replaced by a swipe from the left or right sides of the lower portions of the screen.

The new gestures are fast, smooth and make using large-screen phones much easier, particularly the back swipe gesture, which no longer forces a reach to the bottom left of the phone to tap the back button.

Many Android manufacturers have implemented their own dark themes, including Samsung, Huawei and OnePlus. But now Google has added a full dark mode baked into Android 10, which can be enabled all the time or through a schedule. It joins the dark theme added to a variety of Google and other apps available on Android.

For those with OLED screens, such as those used on higher-end smartphones, enabling the dark theme can help prolong battery life as only the pixels that are not black consume electricity. But most people will enable it for aesthetic reasons.

Smart replies have been expanded from a very limited number of Google apps to most messaging apps, which uses on-device machine learning to provide you with one-tap replies to messages straight from the notification area.

It can also open the appropriate app for things like an address, URL or video straight from the messaging app without having to copy or paste anything, such as giving one-tap access to navigation directions in Google Maps.

To help reduce notification overload, Android now has the choice of: general alerts as they always have been, which make a sound or vibration; silent alerts, which do not make a sound and are held in a cluster out of the way at the bottom of the notification shade; or no notification, which blocks an app from showing particular types of notifications or all notifications if you do not want to be bothered by them.

Silent notifications are useful for things such apps for accessories that you have attached to your phone requiring persistent notifications to work (sports watches are a good example) or mundane but useful things such as the weather.

Google is making great strides to give users greater control over the data they share with apps on their phone, catching up with many of the protections Apple employs in iOS. Android 10 introduces a raft of new controls including the ability to share your location information with an app only when you are using it. Android will also remind you that an app you do not use is accessing your location so you can stop it if you wish.

Privacy controls including an app permission manager, personalised ads, location history and Google account activity are now more easily accessible in the settings menu too, so it’s more straightforward to see what kinds of data is being collected and stop it.

Google is beefing up parental controls on Android using its Family Link feature, which will now be built into the Digital Wellbeing settings app on Android 10. Parents can set up a new phone or device for their child, link it to their account and take control over screen time limits, app installs, track their child’s usage and set a things like a bedtime when the phone shuts off.

The state of Android security updates, which are delivered by Google once a month but do not always reach other manufacturer’s phones in a timely manner, is getting better, with most devices getting at least bi-monthly updates.

In Android 10 a new system allows Google to push out crucial security and privacy fixes straight from the Google Play store. That means users won’t have to wait for their phone manufacturer to release a full Android system update to make sure their data is protected. Faster and more frequent security updates are becoming more and more critical as our phones are tempting targets for hackers and thieves the world over.

Android 10 includes a large collection of new emoji including gender-inclusive designs, such as gender non-specific representations of professions with the option of specifying male or female models if you’d like.

Focus mode, which temporarily silences specific apps you find distracting, is available in beta with a full rollout expected this year. Live Caption, which uses on-device machine learning to put real-time captions on videos, podcasts, audio messages and recordings in any app, will also roll out in the autumn, on Google’s Pixel devices at first.

33,Technology,The drama surrounding Google and Huawei's new phone – explained,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/30/huawei-mate-30-google-what-does-it-mean,2019-08-31T05:00:37Z,"Huawei, the number two smartphone maker in the world, will launch its next flagship device without licensed access to the top smartphone operating system in the world – Google’s Android – or any of Google’s ubiquitous apps.

The 5G-capable Mate 30 will be revealed at a 19 September event in Munich, CNBC reported on Friday. But the launch by a company that saw its share of the European smartphone market soar by 55.7% in 2018 is approaching under a cloud of uncertainty, thanks to the actions of the US government.

Here’s what you need to know about the dispute between the US and Huawei.

Huawei is a Chinese telecommunications company, founded in 1987, whose early history included updating China’s telephone infrastructure and helping the nation transition away from relying on importing foreign-made technology.

It has since expanded internationally and launched its own product lines, including smartphones that are increasingly competitive with Samsung and Apple.

Why is it controversial?

US intelligence services are suspicious that Huawei has close ties to the Chinese military and fear the company could provide the Chinese government with a backdoor into foreign communications networks. The US has pressured its allies not to use Huawei components in the 5G networks they are building, saying it may discontinue intelligence sharing if they continue to work with the firm. The US also arranged for the arrest of the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of its founder and chairman, in Canada in December 2018, on allegations of bank and wire fraud to violate US sanctions against Iran.

In May, the Trump administration escalated its attacks on Huawei with twin moves: an executive order that allows the government to ban technology from “foreign adversaries” if they are determined to pose “unacceptable risks” to national security, and the placement of Huawei on a commerce department “entity list” that bans it from acquiring components or technology from US companies without government approval.

The commerce department has since granted Huawei two 90-day reprieves to allow it to maintain existing infrastructure and provide support to existing Huawei devices. The latest temporary agreement is set to expire on 19 November.

What does this have to do with Google?

As a US-based company, Google is required to comply with the government’s decision to blacklist Huawei. Soon after Huawei was placed on the entity list, a number of American chipmakers confirmed that they would stop supplying Huawei with their products, including Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx and Broadcom. The ban also extends to software products and services, such as Google’s Android, the operating system used by Huawei’s smartphones.

An open-source version of Android is available, but the blacklist will bar Huawei from access to licensed versions that include technical support and pre-installation of Google’s apps, such as Google Maps and Gmail.

While the 90-day temporary licenses granted by the US commerce department have allowed existing Huawei smartphones to keep up to date on Android, the temporary license does not apply to new products, which means the Mate 30 cannot be sold with a licensed version of Android or any of Google’s apps installed.

So how will the phones operate?

It’s unclear. Huawei recently launched its own operating system, which it is calling HarmonyOS. But according to CNBC, the company does not plan to use HarmonyOS on the Mate 30, in part because it doesn’t want to damage its relationship with Google. A company spokesperson told CNBC that Android is still Huawei’s “first choice”.

If Huawei uses the open source version of Android on the phones, users in some parts of the world could be able to download Google apps themselves, but the apps will not come pre-installed. However, uncertainty remains.",-0.5372,
34,Australia news,Bob Hawke auction: true believers and bargain hunters do battle for belongings,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/28/bob-hawke-auction-true-believers-and-bargain-hunters-do-battle-for-belongings,2019-08-27T20:50:17Z,"It’s hard to put a price on what Bob Hawke meant to Australians, but at an auction of more than 200 of the former prime minister’s possessions in Sydney on Tuesday night they did their level best.

A curious mix of a few hundred bargain hunters and true believers gathered in an upstairs room at the Paddington RSL to bid for a piece of the people’s prime minister’s private life at an auction grandly titled “Bob Hawke & Blanche d’Alpuget: Mementos, Curiosities, Art and Design”.

What an odd event it was. Australia’s favourite PM has been dead only 104 days and yet here we were uncomfortably straddling the previously untested Venn diagram of memorial and garage sale.

“Bob was my favourite item but he’s gone so everything else can go,” d’Alpuget told the Sunday Telegraph matter-of-factly as the newly sold four-storey Northbridge mansion she shared with Hawke was thrown open for inspection at the weekend.

Indeed, it’s mawkish to be sentimental when buying a Vico Magistretti three-seater Maralunga sofa ($3,800) or, seriously, Hawke’s Samsung flat-screen television ($420, the catalogue did not specify dimensions). A custom-made office desk went for $9,500. The unremarkable burgundy leather swivel chair it accompanied? $3,200.

An art collector, Lachlan Astle, shrugged when asked what he thought of Hawke’s life being auctioned off: “It’s her stuff.” Astle was there to bid for a Trobriand Islands splashboard, which he secured for $750.

“I thought he was basically the best prime minister we had but I don’t need to have a piece of Bob,” he said.

Outside, Astle gossiped with an auction employee about some of the wilder bidding. A Hugh Sawrey painting that hung in Hawke’s office sold for $23,000 off a reserve of between $8,000 and $12,000. Immediately afterwards, Euan Macleod’s Lone Figure in Gully reached only $11,000, despite being expected to fetch as much as $18,000.

A nearby gallery had purchased the Macleod, she revealed. “So they can sell it, you know – so smart, they got such a good deal.”

But the lounges (plural, there were many lounges), furniture and paintings did not tell the whole story. Australians did – do – love Hawke, of course, and beyond the collectors and bargain hunters the greatest demand was for the things Australia’s 23rd prime minister might himself have cared about.

An inscribed mahogany chess box sold for $5,000. A silver-footed bowl presented to him by the then US Secretary of State Dick Cheney attracted $7,500. Two small silver dishes decorated with frogs sold for $22,000.

How else to explain Wendy Norris and Annette Zulian’s decision to travel up from Wollongong to spend $1,400 on Hawke’s crystal Versace ashtray?

“Everybody loved Bob Hawke,” Zulian said. “We saw him speak at a Labor function only a couple of years ago and he was just brilliant. He got up and sang Solidarity Forever. He was just a normal person, you know, have a beer, have a yarn have a smoke. He was one of us.”

Norris added: “Everybody loved him and everybody trusted him. And if he’d ever knocked on my door I’d have let him in.”

But why the ashtray?

“It’s Versace,” Norris explained. “But it’s also something he would have used and maybe cared about, you know?”

Vince Elias paid $1,400 for a Pakistani cigarette case. He conceded he probably paid “a little bit more” than it was worth – it had a reserve of between $100 and $200 – but, “it’s a piece of history”.

One of Hawke’s most profound legacies was his tearful promise to allow Chinese students to stay in Australia after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.

So it is perhaps unsurprising that anything with a link to China went for well above its reserve. A Chinese famille jaune porcelain vase sold for $4,600. A pair of carved Chinese bone horses fetched $6,000.

James Xie spent $20,000 on a miniature Chinese bookcase given to Hawke as a gift by Zhao Ziyang, China’s premier between 1980 and 1987. It had been listed with a reserve of between $300 and $500.

Xie, who came to Australia 30 years ago from China – but not because of Tiananmen – became emotional when explaining his affection for Hawke. “I have great, great respect for both men [Hawke and Zhao ],” he said.

“I was not one of the ones who came to Australia after but I know what he did for a lot of Chinese university students. When he died, I heard the speech he gave after when he cried and I also shed some tears.”

Was it worth paying so much?",0.9985,

The Galaxy S10 5G is the largest, most advanced and most expensive smartphone in Samsung’s current lineup, aimed not just at being “the 5G one” but also the best one.

Unlike the OnePlus 7 Pro, which comes in either 4G or 5G versions that are identical in size, weight and features, the S10 5G is its own phone. It’s bigger, heavier, thicker and has more cameras and sensors on the back and front than the S10+.

The front is filled by the 6.7in QHD+ AMOLED screen, which curves at the sides and has an large oval-shaped cut out in the top right of the display for two selfie cameras and a depth sensor.

The screen is really lovely, as you’d expect for a top Samsung: bright, crisp and colourful with good viewing angles. It is not quite as bright or smooth as the fantastic 90Hz screen on the OnePlus 7 Pro, but better than all the rest.

The massive screen means the S10 5G is a very big phone. At 77.1mm wide and 162.6mm tall the S10 5G compares similarly to 5G rivals such the OnePlus 7 Pro or the 4G-only iPhone XS Max. But the way the back tapers at the sides and its comparatively light 198g weight, which undercuts the competition by 8-10g, makes the S10 5G just about manageable. I could fit it in a men’s jeans pocket, but anything smaller was a struggle.

If you don’t want the biggest of phones and the downsides of weight, cost, size, one-handed use, etc that come with them, this is most definitely not for you.

The display hides Samsung’s ultrasonic fingerprint scanner for unlocking the phone with your thumb on the screen, which works well enough but isn’t as fast or accurate as the optical sensor on the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G or traditional fingerprint sensors.

The phone is water resistant to the international IP68 standard, or depths of up to 1.5 metres in fresh water for 30 minutes. Drop the S10 5G in the toilet and you’ll be able to rinse it afterwards. It also has a headphone socket, which is rare in 2019.

The Galaxy S10 5G has the same processor, memory and storage as most of the other Galaxy S10 versions and therefore performs similarly. In this US this means Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 processor, but in the UK, Europe and many other regions it means Samsung’s own Exynos 9820, as tested here.

It’s a fast-feeling phone, if not quite the fastest, and will handle most of what you can throw at it. Games and augmented reality experiences, which are being pushed hard with 5G, were smooth but made the phone heat up quite a bit.

The S10 5G has the largest battery in Samsung’s S10 phone line and so lasts the longest at 36 hours between charges. With the screen set to default FHD+ resolution and the always-on display (AOD) setting off, the phone made it from 7am on day one until 7pm on day two with fairly heavy usage, mainly on 4G with bursts on Vodafone’s new 5G network where available in London.

The S10 5G is also faster charging than Samsung’s other phones with a 25W charger included in the box. It hit 90% in an hour, which is still not the fastest charging phone but is a significant improvement over other Samsung devices. Wireless charging at up to 15W with a Qi charging matt works well, as does wireless power sharing charging something else from the back of the S10 5G such as Samsung’s Galaxy Buds.

The S10 5G proved great on Vodafone’s new 5G network, which was significantly faster than 4G when available, routinely managing 200Mbps download speeds in areas where Vodafone’s 4G network managed around 20-50Mbps.

But the S10 5G’s 4G performance on Vodafone’s network was poor, spending a significant amount of time dropping down to 3G in areas where a OnePlus 7 Pro and Huawei P30 Pro had strong 4G signal on the same Vodafone 4G network. The issue was particularly problematic on public transport.

This poor performance gave rise to further testing which revealed that the poor signal performance on Vodafone’s 4G network wasn’t isolated to Samsung’s new 5G phone – but also its regular 4G phones including the Galaxy S10. The 4G-only phones had a slight advantage of around half a bar of signal strength over their 5G counterparts on the same network.

However, when the Samsung phones dropped down to 3G their internet connection effectively became unusable causing everything from web pages and apps, to messages and even email, to time out. But it’s worse than simply being offline, as the phone thinks it has a working internet connection, leading to an extremely frustrating scenario where the phone continually tries over and over to perform the task you’ve set it before timing out after a minute or so.

To be clear, Samsung’s S10, S10+ and S10e performed the same as the OnePlus 7 Pro and Huawei P30 Pro (two of the best for network performance) on both EE and Three’s 4G network in and around London and the south of England. The problem appeared only to be on Vodafone. But neither Vodafone nor Samsung could explain the signal issues faced by the Samsung S10 5G and other S10 smartphones.

A Vodafone spokesperson said: “We’ve recalled the device and SIM for internal testing. We would welcome the opportunity to walk around with the Guardian in the areas they have visited to better understand the user experience found so as we can better understand any issues and implement improvements or fixes.”

A Samsung spokesperson declined to address the 4G problem and instead said: “The 5G user experience is only going to get better as 5G network coverage improves and expands. Samsung is working closely with our partners to provide updates to the device so that consumers can get the best network performance.”

The Galaxy S10 5G runs Samsung’s new One UI version of Android 9 Pie, which is the same as the other S10 variants.

One UI is a big upgrade over previous versions of Samsung’s software, refocused around making phones with large screens more usable, which was useful here. The top of the screen is generally for information display, while the bits you have to touch have been moved towards the bottom.

The only thing that hasn’t aged well are Samsung’s gesture navigation options, which replace the traditional three-key navigation bar at the bottom of the screen with swipe pads where the buttons would be. It’s not a fluid experience and is difficult to use one-handed on this size of screen.

While more beneficial for the larger Galaxy S10+, the S10 still benefits from generally having the top half of the phone for viewing information and the bottom half for touch-based interactions. Rival systems such as that used by OnePlus, Huawei or even Google’s upcoming Android Q are far better.

The Galaxy S10 5G has the same three regular cameras on the back as the S10 and S10+ but adds a 3D depth camera for good measure.

That means you get a main 12-megapixel camera, 12-megapixel telephoto camera and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle camera providing zoom from 0.5 to 2x, and then on to a 10x hybrid zoom.

There didn’t appear to be much difference between the cameras on the S10 5G and S10/S10+. It produced some excellent photos in good light, with solid but not class-leading low-light performance, despite the new night mode.

Video capture was very good, arguably better than many rivals, with fun depth effects using the extra sensors on the S10 5G. The selfie camera is the same as the S10+, which is excellent.

Overall, the camera on the S10 5G is good, but falls short of the best from Huawei.
• None The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is incompatible with most screen protectors, but a compatible one comes included in the box.
• None The haptic vibrations are sharper than last year’s model, but not as good as Apple’s iPhone or the OnePlus 7 Pro.
• None Palm rejection was good at preventing mis-touches on the curved screen edge, where your hand rests on the touchscreen when you grip.

The Samsung Galaxy S10 5G costs £1,099 in crown silver or majestic black on either EE or Vodafone. So far, the phone is not available to buy standalone and SIM-free in the UK.

For comparison, recommended retail prices for the competition include the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G on plans starting at £59 a month on EE, the 4G 6.4in Galaxy S10+ for £899, the 4G OnePlus 7 Pro from £649, the 4G Google Pixel 3 XL costs £744, the 4G Huawei P30 Pro for £899 and the 4G iPhone XS Max costs £1,099.

The Galaxy S10 5G has all the hallmarks of a range-topping Samsung. A big, bright screen, sleek design, solid performance and excellent battery life - the best of any of Samsung’s S10 variants.

The rear camera is also very good and Samsung’s One UI is great, as long as you’re happy using navigation buttons as the swipe gestures are hard to use on this size of phone. It is massive and expensive, meaning only big-phone lovers are going to want to even try and use it.

Its 5G performance is solid on Vodafone’s new 5G network. But the poor 4G performance on Vodafone of the S10 5G and its smaller S10 siblings, which neither the network nor Samsung have managed to explain, mean I strongly recommend not buying any top-end Samsung phone on Vodafone.

It may not quite be the best 5G experience available at the moment – that’s the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G – but it’s close run thing. And where the OnePlus is an EE exclusive in the UK, the S10 5G is available on a wider range of mobile networks.

The S10 5G is the biggest and best Samsung you can buy, at least until the recently launched Note 10 arrives in stores, which could take the crown.

36,Technology,Beats PowerBeats Pro review: Apple's fitness AirPods rock,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/19/beats-powerbeats-pro-review-apple-fitness-airpods-rock,2019-08-19T06:00:39Z,"The PowerBeats Pro are Apple-owned Beats’ first true wireless Bluetooth earbuds that cut the cable and seek to be the ultimate running and gym earphones.

As with Apple’s original AirPods, which looked like a set of the firm’s standard EarPods with the cables cut off, the £220 PowerBeats Pro are basically the firm’s popular PowerBeats 3 neckband Bluetooth earbuds without the cables joining the pair.

That includes the signature ear hook, which tucks behind the top of your ear to hold the earbuds in place. As such the PowerBeats Pro are neither small nor subtle. They come in black, but also a series of attractive colours such as a dark green. Still, if you were looking for a discreet set of earbuds you’ll need to look elsewhere.

In effect the PowerBeats Pro are the anti-AirPods, with an unshakable attachment to your ear and a traditional silicone earbud (of which there is a choice of four) to fill your ear canal and block out more ambient noise. It’s not obvious, but the ear hook is actually adjustable. With a bit of force you can bend it into a more comfortable position. It took me a while to get it right, but once bent to fit your ear properly you get a light yet sturdy hold for up to an hour, after which they caused pain in my left ear.

Due to the ear hook going over your ear, they weren’t comfortable with sunglasses and I expect the same with eyeglasses. It’s also worth noting that despite being marketed as fitness headphones, the PowerBeats Pro do not have any capacity to play music on their own. They are simply Bluetooth earbuds that need to connect to a phone or another device for music.

The biggest downside of the PowerBeats Pro is the giant case. Pocketable this thing is not, and that’s a bit of a problem for true wireless earbuds because once you take them out of your ear they’re easy to lose if you don’t return them to the case. Admittedly the large size of the earbuds makes that less likely than some smaller options, but why the case has to be so big I’m not sure.

Like most other true wireless earbuds, the case has its own battery that’s charged via Apple’s Lightning cable, which is convenient for iPhone users but not so much for Android or iPad Pro users. There’s no wireless charging.

The PowerBeats Pro have class-leading battery life lasting more than eight hours between charges, where most cap out at five. The case will charge the PowerBeats Pro over 1.5 times too, meaning they last for about 24 hours of playback all combined. A quick five-minute trip in the case is worth up to 90 minutes’ playback, which is handy if you forget to charge them.

What gives the PowerBeats Pro their longevity is Apple’s H1 chip – the same one found in the second generation AirPods. It handles the simultaneous attachment to your phone, meaning either bud can be used independently, and provides rock-solid connection even in challenging conditions.

It also handles the instant pairing you get with an iPhone. Open the case for the first time near an iPhone and up pops a pairing prompt on the screen. Once hooked up to one Apple device they can be connected to any others you own that are signed into your iCloud account without having to re-pair them each time.

Pairing with an Android phone is easy too. With the Beats app installed on your phone you can simply open the case near your phone and press and hold the button to pop up a prompt on your phone to pair with one tap. Otherwise simply find them in your standard Bluetooth settings to pair like anything else.

The Beats Android app also gives you the same battery information pop-up when you open the case as you get on an iPhone, which is handy. You can connect them to only one device at a time, but switching between devices is easy: simply demand the connection from another device’s Bluetooth settings and the PowerBeats Pro disconnects from one and connects to the other.

The earbuds also inherit one of Apple’s other features from the AirPods: Hey Siri support. You can simply say the wakewords “Hey Siri” while wearing them to access Apple’s voice assistant on an iPhone. Otherwise pressing and holding the multifunction “b” button on the earbuds fires up Siri or Google Assistant on an Android device.

Buttons are one of the strong points of the PowerBeats Pro. Unlike most other true wireless earbuds they have dedicated volume controls on both earbuds, while the main button takes care of playback controls with single, double and triple presses.

You can also set them to pause playback when you take one out and start again when you reinsert it into your ear.

Beats has a history of bass-heavy headphones. While the PowerBeats Pro have punch in the low-end they aren’t overly dominated by it, which is a good thing. They sound full of energy, with a very forward and spirited sound, which is most suited to listening while doing activity, whether it’s walking, running or working out.

They do fairly well with most music genres. The silicone earbud tips block out some noise, unlike the AirPods, but not a vast amount. It means you have to crank up the volume to hear your music on public transport more than you might with better isolating competitors. Those looking for the best-sounding earbuds might be a little disappointed at this price too – Sony’s WF-1000X or Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless sound better.
• None The PowerBeats Pro are only sweat resistant with an IPX4 rating, not water resistant to IP68 like many smartphones, while the case is not sweat or water resistant.
• None Getting the earbuds to snap into the right place in the case takes a little practice.
• None The lid of the case shuts with a reassuring clunk.
• None Call quality was good, coming across loud and clear to the recipient but with a little background noise.
• None Wind noise is a problem because they stick out of your ears quite far.

The Beats PowerBeats Pro come in black, white, navy or green, costing £219.95.

The PowerBeats Pro are an excellent set of earbuds marred by a few compromises due to the large form and ear attachment.

They sound good, last a long time between charges, have rock-solid connectivity and an excellent set of controls. They also have the same Apple magic that makes the AirPods extremely convenient to use with an iPhone or any other Apple device, which is a massive advantage other brands simply don’t have. You even get a little bit of it on Android thanks to the Beats app.

But the case is enormous, the fit won’t suit everyone, they don’t isolate that well, and forget wearing them with glasses. They’re also fairly expensive, placing them in a bracket filled with excellent true wireless earbuds. Most fitness-orientated sets are much cheaper than this.

So the PowerBeats Pro are for those who wish the AirPods offered a little isolation and held on to their ears better, particularly for exercise. But I still wish Apple just produced a set of AirPods with proper silicone earbud tips.

37,Business,Global dividends hit new high but growth slows to just 1.1%,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/19/global-dividends-new-high-slower-growth-rise-financial-technology,2019-08-19T05:01:33Z,"Shareholders in companies listed on the world’s stock markets pocketed more than half a trillion dollars in dividends during the second quarter of the year, a record for investors’ payouts.

But despite dividends hitting an all-time quarterly high of $513.8bn (£423bn), the pace of year-on-year growth slowed to just 1.1%, compared with 14% this time last year.

Analysts at the asset manager Janus Henderson, which collated the figures from the 1,200 largest listed companies, said this slowdown reflected a weakening global economy and the strength of the dollar.

Financial and energy companies, largely oil and gas, increased their dividends faster than other sectors on an underlying basis, stripping out currency effects and one-off payouts. Banks and other financial companies handed out dividends that were 9.9% higher, and energy companies handed out an 6% increase.

Investors in the fast-growing technology sector, who have seen their dividend income triple over 10 years, had to accept a rare decrease after cuts at Nokia and Samsung.

Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson, said: “At this stage in the economic cycle, we are seeing a moderation of dividend increases across a broad range of companies, and the number of cuts is on the rise, too.

“Global dividends have been growing very quickly over the last two years, however, so the slowdown we are now seeing is not a cause for concern. The underlying growth rate we expect this year is simply in line with the long-run average, rather than well ahead of it.

“The impact of the global economic slowdown is greater in some parts of the world than others, with Europe seeing a particular impact. But this is why taking a global approach to income investing is so valuable – the regional and sector diversification brings significant benefits to investors.”

The world’s largest dividend payer was the Swiss food company Nestlé, which topped the list for the sixth quarter in a row, ahead of the French pharmaceuticals company Sanofi and China Mobile in third. Nestlé paid out more than $7bn in dividends last year.

Shareholders in British companies enjoyed an 8.6% rise in payouts, which reached a quarterly record of $35bn thanks to a $4.2bn boost from special dividends paid by Rio Tinto and Royal Bank of Scotland. The growth was in line with the global average of 5.3% once the impact of one-off payouts and the robust dollar were filtered out.

The strength of the US currency means that dividends paid out in sterling and other struggling currencies are lower when reported in dollar terms.

Investors scouring global markets for growth will have done well if they put their money in stocks from Japan, where payouts rose 10%, or emerging markets such as Brazil, China, India and Turkey, up 12.6% on average.

Janus Henderson said its forecast of global dividend payouts for the year remains unchanged at $1.43tn, an annual increase of 4.2%.",0.993,
38,Australia news,Federal police fight court ruling a mobile phone is not a computer,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/19/federal-police-fight-court-ruling-a-mobile-phone-is-not-a-computer,2019-08-19T03:30:09Z,"Australian federal police are fighting a federal court ruling that a smartphone is not considered a computer, making a warrant it was using to force a suspect to unlock a phone invalid.

In August last year, the AFP obtained a warrant under section 3LA of the Crimes Act to unlock a gold-coloured Samsung phone found in the centre console of the man’s car when he was pulled over and searched.

The man supplied the password for a laptop also in the car, and a second phone did not have a pin to unlock, but when asked about the gold phone, he answered “no comment” and would not provide a password for the phone.

He later claimed it wasn’t his phone and he didn’t know the password to access it.

The federal court last month overturned the magistrate’s decision to grant a warrant forcing the man to provide assistance in unlocking the phone.

The decision was overturned on several grounds, notably judge Richard White found that the Samsung phone was not a computer or data storage device as defined by the federal Crimes Act.

The law does not define a computer, but defines data storage devices as a “thing containing, or designed to contain, data for use by a computer”.

White found that the phone could not be defined as a computer or data storage device.

“While a mobile phone may have the capacity to ‘perform mathematical computations electronically according to a series of stored instructions called a program’, it does not seem apt to call such an item a computer,” he said.

“Mobile phones are primarily devices for communicating although it is now commonplace for them to have a number of other functions ... Again, the very ubiquity of mobile phones suggests that, if the parliament had intended that they should be encompassed by the term ‘computer’ it would have been obvious to say so.”

He also overturned the decision arguing that the order was not specific enough to what the AFP required the man to do – provide a password or pin or a fingerprint, or to decrypt any data.

The AFP commissioner argued that the order was written requiring the man to provide “particular information or assistance” in order to allow flexibility in what they required him to do without needing to get another warrant.

In the appeal filed earlier this month, obtained by Guardian Australia, the AFP argued that level of specificity was not required under the law, and White erred in stating that the phone was not a computer because a smartphone “performs the same functions and mathematical computations as a computer and is designed to contain data for use by a computer”.

No court date has yet been set for the appeal.

The Australian federal police declined to comment to Guardian Australia on the broader implications of the decision, stating in was inappropriate to comment while an appeal was under way.

In his judgment, White noted that much of 3LA in the Crimes Act had been amended as part of the Telecommunications (Assistance and Access) Act passed in December 2018, and the case in question is about the law before it was amended.

The amendments to the Crimes Act, however, did not define a computer or data storage device beyond what was already in the law. The changes to 3LA just increased the penalty for failure to comply with such orders from two years to a maximum of 10 years in jail.",-0.9022,
39,Technology,Honor 20 Pro review: it’s all about the camera,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/16/honor-20-pro-review-camera-optical-zoom-huawei,2019-08-16T06:00:20Z,"The best camera in the mid-range market, backed by good performance and long battery life

The Honor 20 Pro is the new flagship phone for Huawei’s cheaper offshoot, offering some of what made the Chinese firm the camera master but at £550 it is a little overpriced.

The Honor 20 Pro is essentially the same phone as the £400 Honor 20 with a better camera on the back, a slightly larger battery and more storage. It was meant to be released alongside its cheaper sibling, but Donald Trump’s Huawei blockade caused it to be delayed.

From the outside the phones are practically identical. The Honor 20 Pro is 0.5mm thicker, 0.3mm taller and 8g heavier than the Honor 20, not that you’d notice. It has the same 6.26in LCD screen, which looks good but can’t match the OLED screens on rivals.

The same 32MP selfie camera pokes through the same-sized hole-punch notch in the top left of the display. The body has the same metal sides and glass back. The Honor 20 Pro has a nicer light-reflecting finish under the glass, but it’ll probably spend most of its life in a case anyway.

The side-mounted fingerprint scanner, which doubles as the power button, is equally great for right-handed users, but less so for those who primarily use their phone in their left. There’s no headphone socket either.

Overall the Honor 20 Pro is a good-looking, well-made phone that has a large screen, but isn’t quite as massive as some of the monsters available in 2019.
• None Connectivity: USB-C (2.0), LTE, wifi, NFC, Bluetooth 5 and GPS (dual-sim available in some regions)

Under the hood is the same Kirin 980 chip as the Honor 20, but the 20 Pro has 2GB more RAM (8GB total) and twice as much storage at 256GB. Unsurprisingly it performs exactly the same. I couldn’t appreciate the greater amount of RAM in day-to-day usage.

That means you get a good performing all-rounder, which feels slick in operation, but not quite as fast and smooth as the OnePlus 7 or 7 Pro. The battery also lasts a long time, managing over 36 hours between charges, enough to see me from 7am on day one to 7pm on day two – four hours longer than the Honor 20.

There’s no wireless charging on the Honor 20 Pro. Cable charging reaches 75% in an hour and a full power in less than 90 minutes.

The Honor 20 Pro runs the exact same Android 9 Pie-based Magic UI 2.1 software as the Honor 20. It works well most of the time, is good on battery and is fairly customisable. Some might not like the look of it out of the box, but you can change most of it with themes.

It’s not as good as OxygenOS on a OnePlus nor Google’s Pixel phones, but it’s getting better with each software release.

Under normal circumstances you could expect bi-monthly software updates for two to three years from release. But there’s a question mark still hanging over Huawei and therefore Honor’s ability to work with US companies such as Google, due to Trump’s actions. Honor says it is “confident” that it can update the 20 Pro with Android Q.

The Honor 20 Pro has the same great 48MP standard camera, with added optical image stabilisation here, fun 16MP ultra-wide angle camera and disappointing 2MP macro camera as the Honor 20. New for the Honor 20 Pro is an 8MP telephoto camera with a 3x optical zoom.

That means you get some really good images from the main camera, well balanced with good colour and dynamic range. While overall detail is good, images look a little smooth on a highly textured surface on full crop, something most will probably never do.

Low-light performance was also good, although not quite as game-changing as Huawei’s P30 Pro. The ultra-wide angle camera is clearly inferior in less than ideal lighting conditions, but works really well in good lighting and gives you another perspective to use in your photography.

The 8MP telephoto camera produces a 3x optical, 5x hybrid and then up to 30x digital zoom. The 3x and 5x zooms produce really good, usable images in even average light levels, getting you far closer to the action than 2x optical zooms. The Honor 20 Pro has the best zoom short of the Huawei P30 Pro, which has 5x optical zoom, 10x hybrid and 50x digital.

Performance in video was similar to flagship rivals, although it caps out at 4K at 30 frames per second (not 60fps). While the camera app is generally easy to use, it still hives off HDR to a dedicated mode, rather than being built straight into the main photo mode. The front-facing 32MP camera pokes through a hole in the screen and is good, capturing detail-rich selfies even in fairly challenging lighting conditions.
• None The phone is pretty slippery so you’ll need a case to keep it from dropping out of shallow pockets when you sit down.
• None The vibration motor is not as good as rivals in 2019, feeling baggy and imprecise.
• None The frame of the phone traps hairs and fluff.
• None Call quality was good, but the speaker is fairly small and needs a bit of attention to get the correct alignment with your ear.

The Honor 20 Pro costs £550 in either phantom black (purple) or phantom blue (green).

For comparison, the Honor 20 costs £400, Honor View20 costs £350, the OnePlus 7 costs £499, the Huawei P30 Pro costs £899, the Samsung Galaxy S10e costs £669 and the Apple iPhone XR costs £749.

The Honor 20 Pro offers a lot of camera for £550, getting you closer to the action and with a greater versatility than some phones that cost twice as much.

The rest of the phone is good too. It’s slick, isn’t enormous, has top performance and long battery life. The software is solid too, but there’s still the Trump-China trade war lingering over things that could cause issues with Android security and version updates should it escalate.

The two biggest problems with the Honor 20 Pro are its price and the existence of its non-Pro sibling. You get the same experience minus the camera zoom with the vanilla Honor 20 for £150 less, which also undercuts the best of the competition: namely the £499 OnePlus 7. I would argue the Honor 20 Pro is therefore £50 too expensive.

So the question is whether the Honor 20 Pro’s optical zoom is worth the extra money. If you’re after one of the most capable and adaptable camera systems on your phone for less than £600 then yes. If not there is better value to be had elsewhere.

40,Technology,Sony WF-1000XM3 review: updated noise-cancelling earbuds sound great,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/14/sony-wf-1000xm3-review-updated-noise-cancelling-earbuds-sound-great,2019-08-14T06:00:12Z,"True wireless buds are Sony’s best yet, but where is the volume control?

Sony’s latest true wireless WF-1000XM3 earbuds offer both noise cancelling and top-end sound quality while undercutting premium rivals on price.

The replacement for the WF-1000X, which were some of the first noise cancelling true wireless earbuds available, the new “M3” portion of the model number denotes the company’s third generation of active noise cancelling technology and the QN1e chip, which is rivalled only by Bose.

Let’s be clear, this is the top end of the market; at £220 they will be out of the range of many buyers, although there are rivals costing more than £300.

The WF-1000XM3 pack more technology in them than your standard true wireless earbuds, and are pretty big as a result. They’re attractive and more balanced in the ear than some sets, but have a resemblance to the old-school Bluetooth headsets made popular by taxi drivers everywhere; if you were looking for a set of discreet earbuds, these are not for you.

The trunk of the earbuds sticks quite far out of your ear, with the oval-shaped body projected forwards towards your mouth. There’s a circular touchpad on each bud for controls – single, double and triple taps can take care of playback, change the noise reduction mode or activate Google Assistant. Which side does what can be configured in an Android or iOS app.

Tapping and holding the left bud activates ambient listening mode, reducing the volume and noise reduction, which is useful for catching public transport announcements. Talking to people using ambient mode is possible too, but I wouldn’t recommend it because people will think you’re being incredibly rude.

Taking out one of the buds pauses the music. Popping it back in starts it again. All the controls work very well, but they’re missing the big one: volume. You’ve got to dig out your phone to change the volume, which is a real shame.

The attractive flip-top charging case is too big to really pocket, which means it’ll have to go in a bag. It charges in 3.5 hours via USB-C and will charge the earbuds three times. A 10-minute stay in the case charges the earbuds for about 90 minutes of playback time, while a full charge takes 90 minutes.

You’ll get between five and six hours of constant playback with noise cancelling on, or eight with it off, for a total of 22 to 32 hours, using the case.

Sony ditched the ear hook from its previous true wireless earbuds in favour of a new “high-friction rubber surface” on the outer part that enters your ear.

With the correct earbud tip, chosen from the seven pairs included, the fit is pretty secure, despite the size and 8.5g weight, which is on the heavy side for wireless earbuds. I would not recommend them for running, though – they are not water resistant. Generally, they are fairly comfortable in the ear, but I found if I didn’t quite get the right orientation the outer rubber surface caused pain in the fleshy bits of my ear after about 45 minutes.

The Sony WF-1000XM3 are the most effective in-ear noise cancelling earphones I have tried, including those with wires and large batteries. Noise across the board is effectively reduced, including train noise, road noise and engine rumble, meaning you can listen to your music, and hear it clearly, at lower volumes.

The earbuds are heavily affected by wind noise, however, which appears to be a function of their size and how much they stick out of your ears. The wind noise reduction setting appears to do very little.

An ambient sound mode pipes noise in from the outside world, which is good for awareness. There’s an adaptive sound mode too that adjusts the noise cancelling depending on what you’re doing. I found simply leaving the noise cancelling set to maximum to be best.

The best thing about the WF-1000XM3 is how they sound. We’re not short of great-sounding, expensive, true wireless earbuds. The Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless were the best, but no longer. Sony’s finally cracked it on sound.

The WF-1000XM3 produce the sort of sparkling audio that allows you to hear new things in longtime favourite tracks. With great energy and clarity, crisp highs, balanced treble and punchy bass, the earbuds sound brilliant out of the box. Sony’s DSEE HX system also works well at bringing life back to highly compressed tracks, but you can also tweak the equaliser manually or use one of the many presets, such as the classic Bass Boost.

The new earbuds only support SBC and AAC Bluetooth audio formats, not the higher-quality aptX or Sony’s own LDAC. But they do support Bluetooth 5.0, with each bud making a connection directly to the phone rather than piggybacking off one another. The result is a rock-solid connection, even in challenging conditions, and reduced latency. Even with the oft-problematic YouTube app, I couldn’t spot any lip-sync issues where the sound and the video appear out of time, and only mild lag with games.

You can only have one device connected at a time, and switching between them requires manually disconnecting from one device before connecting to the other, which is a bit of a pain.
• None The voice announcements (telling you what you’ve just changed) delay any mode changes until the full announcement has finished, which can be tediously slow. Turning off voice announcements solved the problem.
• None Google Assistant is built in, for reading notifications and more advanced functions, or you can simply use the standard Google Assistant or Siri functions on your phone.
• None An NFC spot on the case provides one-tap pairing.
• None It’s difficult to tell how much charge is left in the case.
• None Call quality was great, with minimal background noise, but became muffled and distant in louder environments.

The Sony WF-1000XM3 cost £220 and are available in black or silver.

For comparison, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless cost £280, the B&O E8 2.0 cost £300 and the Master & Dynamic MW07 cost £279.

Sony’s hit a home run with the WF-1000XM3. Terrible name, excellent set of earbuds. Packing genuinely impressive noise cancelling technology, brilliant sound, rock-solid connectivity and even long battery life into wireless earbuds is something of an achievement.

All that technology makes the earbuds massive, which causes people to stare at you occasionally – if you want something discreet, these are not it. It can be difficult to get the right fit too, and the case, while attractive, is too large to comfortably fit in a pocket. They also lack a volume control on the earbuds, which is mildly annoying.

While a price of £220 doesn’t sound cheap, the WF-1000XM3 actually undercut the best-sounding competition by £60-80.

They’re not for everyone, but the Sony WF-1000XM3 are the best-sounding, most feature-packed true wireless earbuds you can buy right now.

41,Opinion,Conservatives hate red tape – unless it’s to regulate the behaviour of their enemies | Richard Denniss,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/08/conservatives-hate-red-tape-unless-its-to-regulate-the-behaviour-of-their-enemies,2019-08-08T03:28:56Z,"Australia needs more regulation of the banks, more regulation of the aged care sector, more regulation of property developers, more regulation of the mining industry and more regulation of the way we use the water in our rivers. But conservatives are still calling for a reduction of so-called red tape. WTF?

Hundreds of high-rise buildings in Australia are clad in the same flammable materials that caused the deaths of 72 people in London’s Grenfell Tower disaster. No “red tape” was there to stop the materials being imported past our “strong borders”. No red tape stopped builders installing it. And no red tape stood in the way of potentially deadly buildings being certified as safe to inhabit before units were sold to unsuspecting families.

Frail elderly people in Australian aged care centres are physically restrained and overmedicated to make them easier to manage. The aged care royal commission has found evidence of chronic understaffing and a lack of training at multiple aged care centres. Malnutrition is not uncommon, nor are bed sores.

Coalmining in Sydney’s main water catchment has resulted in bright-orange water in the tributaries that supply the city’s drinking water. And at the same time that climate change threatens Sydney’s water supply, subsidence cracks from one coalmine have led to an estimated 1.3bn litres of water being lost from the city’s dams. Despite this, Peabody Energy are seeking to expand their coalmining under the catchment, and the Morrison government is keen to speed up approval processes for new mines.

The royal commission into banking spent months highlighting how easy it is for powerful institutions to exploit vulnerable Australians. After hearing evidence of the structural and moral weaknesses of Australia’s largest financial institutions – including stealing from dead people – Kenneth Hayne made 76 recommendations for more regulation. With no weasel words about the need for a regulatory impact statement or cost benefit analysis, the government promised to act on all of Hayne’s recommendations.

So, what’s going on? How can the government accept the recommendations for the banking sector, yet still declare war on red tape and regulation?

If conservatives were serious about removing red tape Apple wouldn’t be able to sue Samsung for making a smartphone in the shape of a rectangle; Adani wouldn’t be able to demand that a Wangan and Jagalingou man Adrian Burragubba, pay them $600,000 in legal costs; and without regulation, the government’s Australian Building and Construction Commission wouldn’t be able to charge union officials for having a cup of tea with a friend at a worksite.

Indeed, conservatives love regulating the behaviour of their enemies. The right to strike is a fundamental human right, enshrined in international law, but no such protection exists in Australia – without permission from a bureaucrat at the Fair Work Commission, that is.

And, if you have an accident at work, there are specific laws that prevent most people from taking their employer to court for damages. While millionaires can get hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages if their feelings get hurt by defamatory statements, if you are permanently disabled in an industrial accident, there are laws that cap how much compensation you can get. And it’s a lot less than for the hurt feelings of a millionaire.

Then there’s abortion. It is still a criminal offence for a woman to get an abortion in New South Wales. The independent MP Alex Greenwich has introduced a bill to remove this anachronistic law, but – guess what – a bunch of conservatives think that there is no need to reduce the red tape women endure to access this particular medical procedure.

You would think that those who say the individual is best placed to make their own decisions would champion a woman’s right to choose. You would think that those who rage against unnecessary government interference in our lives would be on the side of the liberty of individuals in the battle against oppression by the collective. But no, not in Australia.

The same is evident in Australia’s so-called “anti-terror” regulations. According to George Williams, since 2001 successive Australian governments have introduced more anti-terrorism laws than any other country in the world. Indeed, Australia’s response to the attacks of 9/11 has been to create more anti-terrorism laws than the US itself.

Why do Australian conservatives obsess about “freeing workers” from collective bargaining so they can be pushed on to individual contracts, but not a woman’s right to choose whether to have an abortion?

It’s easy to understand rightwing Australia once you realise it is defined by interests and not ideas. By arguing for deregulation in the market-sphere and regulation in the private-sphere, John Howard deregulated the labour market and regulated who could marry; he wanted free trade deals but opposed voluntary euthanasia; he wanted to privatise our national assets but publicly control a woman’s right to choose.

There is nothing right or wrong, good or bad, efficient or inefficient about regulation. Different people, in different countries, at different points in time all have different opinions about which regulations are good and which are bad. Conservatives in the US are obsessed with the right of people to own semi-automatic weapons, but in Australia, it was Howard who won the fight to introduce bans on those killing machines.

When powerful people in Australia want more freedom, they demand less regulation – usually on the basis that it will create jobs. But when powerless people want regulations, the powerful resist and claim it will “cost jobs”.

Regulations don’t create or destroy jobs – they’re simply the rules we collectively agree we should all live by – but, as we’ve seen with the banking, building and aged care sectors, a lack of regulation can destroy lives.

42,Technology,Samsung Galaxy Note 10 launch: big screens and stylus air gestures,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/07/samsung-galaxy-note-10-launch-big-screens-and-stylus-air-gestures,2019-08-07T12:05:08Z,"Samsung will launch various models of its latest Galaxy Note 10 flagship smartphone in New York on Wednesday, hoping to woo its biggest fans with new stylus and camera features.

The original Galaxy Note introduced the concept of the big-screen smartphone in 2011, cementing Samsung as a key player in the market. Recent Note models, however, have struggled to differentiate themselves from Samsung’s other flagship smartphone line, the Galaxy S.

According to several credible leaks and sources that spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, the new Samsung phones will come in two major versions, the Note 10 and Note 10+, as well as 5G-enabled models.

Samsung is looking to rekindle its fanbase with more powerful stylus features – a long-time differentiator of the Note series – new camera features and long battery life.

The Note 10 is the smaller and cheaper of the new phones. It has a 6.3in (16cm) screen that fills almost the entire front of the device, save tiny bezels at the top and bottom of the display and a selfie camera that pokes through a hole in the centre of the top of the screen.

The more expensive Note 10+ will have the same design, but with a giant 6.8in screen that eclipses the 6.7in Galaxy S10 5G as Samsung’s biggest top-end smartphone for 2019.

A 5G version will also be released in certain markets, in a similar way to the introduction of the Galaxy S10 5G.

All Note 10 versions will feature Samsung’s upgraded S Pen stylus, which in addition to precision drawing and pointing on the screen, will have new air gesture controls first introduced last week with the Galaxy Tab S6.

Users of the Note 10 models will be able to scroll through photos by flicking the stylus left and right in the air like a wand, and zoom in and out by twirling it in a circular motion. Other motions are also available. These gestures are in addition to the use of the button on the S Pen as a remote for taking photos and other functions introduced with the Note 9 last year.

All the Note 10 versions will also have a triple camera system on the back of the phone, which mirrors that found on Samsung’s more expensive S10 models, including a standard, ultra-wide and 2x telephoto lens. The Note 10+ is also expected to have a depth-sensing camera similar to the time-of-flight sensor on the S10 5G.

All Note 10 models will have USB-C fast charging, wireless charging and wireless powershare for charging other devices from the back of the phone, matching other top Samsung models.

The Note 10 smartphones are expected to be Samsung’s first top-end models to remove the fan-favourite headphone socket in favour of a USB-C to 3.5mm dongle. Given the majority of the high-end market has already removed the headphone socket, this will likely be the nail in the coffin of the analogue port.

The US Center for SafeSport placed the ban for the 81-year-old Morris on its website Monday. A spokesperson for the independent investigative body tasked with probing sexual misconduct in Olympic sports called it the most severe it’s meted out, according to the New York Times.

Morris, who became one of the sport’s most renowned trainers after winning Olympic silver as the show jumping team’s youngest member in Rome, and went on to coach the US and Brazilian teams.

In a statement, Morris said he will appeal the ban, which stems from “events that allegedly occurred between 1968 and 1972”.

“Any allegations that suggest I have acted in ways that are harmful to any individual, the broader equestrian community and sport that I love dearly are false and hurtful,” he said.

This year, the US Equestrian Federation updated its bylaws to officially bring trainers, who often operate as independent contractors, under the umbrella of its safe-sport policy.

Morris accepted the role of US show jumping chef d’equipe in 2005, leading the American team to a victory in the 2005 Samsung Super League series, a team silver at the 2006 FEI World Equestrian Games and a team gold at the 2008 Olympic Games.

45,Opinion,Starbucks v Dunkin': how capitalism gives us the illusion of choice | Richard Reeves,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/29/starbucks-v-dunkin-how-capitalism-gives-us-the-illusion-of-choice,2019-07-29T10:00:41Z,"American culture valorizes the small. Small-town life is overrepresented and romanticized on the screen – think Hawkins in Stranger Things – a form of escapism in a country where 80% of people live in a city, but two in five say they’d prefer a rural or small-town home. Likewise companies: US adults are three times as likely to have a “very favorable” view of small businesses as they are of large enterprises (59% v 17%), according to a 2018 survey from the Public Affairs Council.

The nostalgia for small-town life and “mom and pop” stores stands in stark contrast not only to an urbanized population but the power of large companies. Capitalism is an engine of choice-making and competition, but very often the competition is between brands owned by the same company, or between small numbers of large economic players. Smallness rules the imagination; bigness rules the high street.

From the moment we wake up to eat our cereal and brush our teeth, our consumer choices are dominated by a handful of large companies.

You brush every morning, right? Good. And there are so very many pastes to choose from. But most of these are produced by one of the three companies that dominate the market: Crest (20%), Colgate (21%) and Sensodyne (12%).

A meal created by modernity, cereal has become a staple of western diets (unfortunately, but that’s another story). And it does not come artisan crafted from down the road, but from huge companies: Kellogg and General Mills have virtually carved the market up between them, accounting for almost a third of sales each.

Most Americans drive to work, and most do so in a car manufactured by one of four companies: General Motors, Ford, Toyota or Fiat Chrysler. Together these four account for 60% of car sales. That said, the next five companies account for 30%: Honda, Nissan, Subaru, Hyundai and Kia. Here at least there seems to be some pretty robust competition, not least from overseas. But let’s see if that lasts.

Grab a coffee on the way to the office? Chances are it will either be from Starbucks (40% market share) or Dunkin’ (22%). When it comes to caffeine, not much choice across companies is required, it seems.

The first things millions of Americans do when they sit at work, maybe coffee still in hand, is logon. Seven out of ten will do so via Microsoft Windows, another 20% using the Apple OS operating system.

Unless blocked by company policy, there is a good chance of visiting some social media sites during the day. For all its travails, Facebook remains the big daddy, with a 37% market share, followed by YouTube at 27%.

Calling a friend for after-work plans? That will be with an iPhone, most likely (55% market share): or perhaps a Samsung (25%). Either way, the chances are it will be using either Verizon or AT&T, who between them control two-thirds of the wireless market.

Big companies dominate consumption. This is not a bad thing in itself. Companies get big by winning customers, and they win customers by providing a good product and/or service, which is the whole point of consumer markets. Different divisions of large companies may compete against each other; consumers are often unaware that they are choosing between two products owned by the same company. The problem comes if success leads to incumbency, with large, powerful companies able to use their power to shape regulations to suit them, rather than assist their competitors. Being market-friendly is not the same thing as being business-friendly, a confusion common to politicians. Big is neither beautiful nor bad, so long as regulators remain faithful to consumers, rather than the companies serving them.",0.9945,
46,Technology,5G in Australia: getting up to speed with the future of mobile,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/28/5g-in-australia-getting-up-to-speed-with-the-future-of-mobile,2019-07-27T22:00:09Z,"Australia’s mobile networks are currently embarking on major upgrades to get the country ready for 5G. While patches of 5G networks are already available in some Australian cities, it won’t be until at least 2020 that 5G has any real impact, and several more years until the networks are completed. So until then, what is all the fuss about?

5G is a marketing term for the fifth generation of mobile networks. The ones people tend to remember are 3G and 4G because they coincided with the rise of smartphones equipped for everyday internet use.

5G is the next phase, and will offer much higher speeds and lower latency (faster response time) than is available on 4G.

5G operates in radio waves like 4G, but at much higher frequencies – anywhere between 1GHz and 300GHz, compared with the most prominent band for 4G in Australia, 700MHz.

Initially 5G in Australia will operate in a lower band (3.6GHz) but the telecommunications companies will eventually seek access to higher bands that will allow them to deliver services via millimetre wave (the band between 30GHz and 300GHz). Millimetre wave is higher frequency spectrum than mobile networks have had access to in the past. The government sells licences at auctions to use higher bands.

As with previous generations, 5G will work with 4G until eventually every user has moved across, and the legacy networks can be deactivated.

Australian networks still run 3G as a fallback, despite 4G now being the standard.

How is it different from what I have today?

The biggest advantages of 5G are the sheer amount of data it can transfer and the extremely low latency, which affects how fast pages load.

Eventually there will be download speeds of up to 10Gbps, which is 10 times higher than the highest package on offer on the fibre-to-the-premises NBN.

At the moment, however, 5G speeds are currently trailing below 4G speeds in Australia, according to market analysis site OpenSignal.

That is, in part, because it is still a fairly new technology that hasn’t been rolled out in many locations, but also because companies in Australia are not using the higher spectrum band, which would offer much higher speeds.

The initial phase of 5G will be similar to 4G and 3G, but once the telecommunications companies have access to the much higher frequency spectrum then more data can be funnelled through the network.

5G beamforming allows more efficient transfer of data by directly targeting users seeking data rather than the current approach which scatters the data everywhere at once, creating a lot of noise.

It will also be good for the arrival of the so-called “internet of things”. In a time where just about everything is connected to the internet in some way, 5G allows networks to keep up with the traffic demand for the foreseeable future.

The lower latency also brings 5G closer to replicating the experience of using a service that is right in your home or office. On 3G, response time is usually around 100 milliseconds, while on 4G it is about 30 milliseconds. On 5G it is promised to be as low as 1 millisecond.

This provides a lot of benefit for businesses on 5G that isn’t available on 4G today.

Commonwealth Bank, for example, is trialling 5G for edge computing. In cloud computing today, all the data and applications are stored centrally and accessed over networks. In edge computing, the aim is to bring the data closer to the user, and to reduce bandwidth use and the amount of time it takes to process data.

The other, often-touted, advantage of 5G is for automation, particularly in the farming and mining sectors. Machine-to-machine communications, and the remote control of farming machinery and irrigation requires the kind of bandwidth only 5G can provide.

The higher band of spectrum a mobile network uses, the shorter distance it can travel to reach users, meaning there will be a need for more cells where people connect to the network as the higher-spectrum 5G rolls out. But micro-cells can be as small as a tiny box on a street light, compared with the towers or rooftop cell installations that are across Australia today.

Will it replace the NBN?

Not in the immediate future. It’s still a long way off from from being ubiquitous or posing any major threat to fixed-line networks you connect in homes or businesses today, usually via wifi connected to fibre or cable connections offered by companies such as the NBN.

Telstra says only around 15% of its mobile customers don’t have a fixed-line internet service at home.

That’s low now, but if users have access to a more reliable service that is priced the same as fixed without all the hassle of getting set up for a new connection, there’s a good chance NBN could be in trouble.

Optus has focused its initial launch of 5G on offering home broadband for unlimited downloads at 50Mbps for $70 per month. This is extremely competitive with the NBN, on which Optus offers the same plan starting at $85 per month.

NBN, meanwhile, is testing the waters for its own 5G, even while there remains ongoing issues with its fixed 4G network for regional areas of Australia.

What does it mean for my phone?

Analyst firm Telsyte predicts adoption of 5G handsets in Australia will be quicker than it was for 4G, getting to 15m 5G phones in Australia between six and 12 months sooner than 4G.

Part of the reason behind that, Telsyte has said, is because 5G handsets will be available sooner than 4G handsets were. It was a full three months after Telstra initially launched 4G that the first handset was available in Australia.

So far, Samsung, LG, Oppo and Huawei have announced 5G handsets for Australia.

Telecommunications companies in Australia seem to believe 5G is not just your standard upgrade and people should be willing to pay more to access the network.

But the Telsyte research stated just one in four users were willing to pay more for 5G, at an average of $5 to $10 extra per month.

Telstra is currently offering 5G for free for the next 12 months in the extremely limited 35 areas it is available, but after that customers will have to pay $15 per month extra unless they’re on one of the two most expensive monthly plans.

With each new technology, there is the inevitable “won’t it cause cancer” or some other such controversy.

Protest groups have formed around the world, including several in Australia, warning about health dangers associated with 5G.

In particular, they are concerned about the impact that the new millimetre wave technology will have on humans.

The World Health Organisation has found that “despite extensive research, to date there is no evidence to conclude that exposure to low-level electromagnetic fields is harmful to human health”.

The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, has declared there are no established health effects from radio waves that 5G uses, and has even gone to the trouble of setting up a page specifically devoted to the misinformation surrounding 5G.

Arpansa notes that because 5G operates in higher frequencies, the energy is absorbed mostly within the surface of the skin, and there are already a range of devices that use higher frequencies, such as security screenings in airports, police radar guns, remote sensors and in medicine.

Research into the health effects is ongoing.

Why was Huawei banned from 5G in Australia?

That’s more a political than technical question. There have been long-running fears in the security agencies in the five-eyes countries about Huawei’s ties to the Chinese government.

Up until recent law changes, the Australian government had no power to tell a company such as Telstra or Optus that it couldn’t use a certain supplier in its networks if there were security concerns.

Huawei was already banned by the government from supplying to NBN because the government owns NBN and can tell it what to do, but after the law change the government banned certain Chinese suppliers from being involved in 5G in Australia.

Huawei is used in 4G networks in Australia today, but the government argues that is for the radio network, not the core of the 4G networks. In 5G, the government argued, that is less separated, making it difficult to unscramble the egg.

Telstra has argued that through its long-standing partnership with Ericsson, the company is not disadvantaged by Huawei being banned. Telstra told Guardian Australia that Ericsson’s technology is developed to the same level as what Huawei has on offer.

TPG in January, however, canned its $100m investment in building a 4G network as a result of the ban. The company had been constructing the 4G network with Huawei as its main vendor, and had aimed to upgrade the network to 5G using more Huawei network gear, but said that it did not make commercial sense to continue constructing the network given Huawei was banned.",-0.9739,
47,Technology,Apple contractors 'regularly hear confidential details' on Siri recordings,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings,2019-07-26T16:34:45Z,"Apple contractors regularly hear confidential medical information, drug deals, and recordings of couples having sex, as part of their job providing quality control, or “grading”, the company’s Siri voice assistant, the Guardian has learned.

Although Apple does not explicitly disclose it in its consumer-facing privacy documentation, a small proportion of Siri recordings are passed on to contractors working for the company around the world. They are tasked with grading the responses on a variety of factors, including whether the activation of the voice assistant was deliberate or accidental, whether the query was something Siri could be expected to help with and whether Siri’s response was appropriate.

Apple says the data “is used to help Siri and dictation … understand you better and recognise what you say”.

But the company does not explicitly state that that work is undertaken by humans who listen to the pseudonymised recordings.

Apple told the Guardian: “A small portion of Siri requests are analysed to improve Siri and dictation. User requests are not associated with the user’s Apple ID. Siri responses are analysed in secure facilities and all reviewers are under the obligation to adhere to Apple’s strict confidentiality requirements.” The company added that a very small random subset, less than 1% of daily Siri activations, are used for grading, and those used are typically only a few seconds long.

A whistleblower working for the firm, who asked to remain anonymous due to fears over their job, expressed concerns about this lack of disclosure, particularly given the frequency with which accidental activations pick up extremely sensitive personal information.

Siri can be accidentally activated when it mistakenly hears its “wake word”, the phrase “hey Siri”. Those mistakes can be understandable – a BBC interview about Syria was interrupted by the assistant last year – or less so. “The sound of a zip, Siri often hears as a trigger,” the contractor said. The service can also be activated in other ways. For instance, if an Apple Watch detects it has been raised and then hears speech, Siri is automatically activated.

The whistleblower said: “There have been countless instances of recordings featuring private discussions between doctors and patients, business deals, seemingly criminal dealings, sexual encounters and so on. These recordings are accompanied by user data showing location, contact details, and app data.”

That accompanying information may be used to verify whether a request was successfully dealt with. In its privacy documents, Apple says the Siri data “is not linked to other data that Apple may have from your use of other Apple services”. There is no specific name or identifier attached to a record and no individual recording can be easily linked to other recordings.

Accidental activations led to the receipt of the most sensitive data that was sent to Apple. Although Siri is included on most Apple devices, the contractor highlighted the Apple Watch and the company’s HomePod smart speaker as the most frequent sources of mistaken recordings. “The regularity of accidental triggers on the watch is incredibly high,” they said. “The watch can record some snippets that will be 30 seconds – not that long but you can gather a good idea of what’s going on.”

Sometimes, “you can definitely hear a doctor and patient, talking about the medical history of the patient. Or you’d hear someone, maybe with car engine background noise – you can’t say definitely, but it’s a drug deal … you can definitely hear it happening. And you’d hear, like, people engaging in sexual acts that are accidentally recorded on the pod or the watch.”

The contractor said staff were encouraged to report accidental activations “but only as a technical problem”, with no specific procedures to deal with sensitive recordings. “We’re encouraged to hit targets, and get through work as fast as possible. The only function for reporting what you’re listening to seems to be for technical problems. There’s nothing about reporting the content.”

As well as the discomfort they felt listening to such private information, the contractor said they were motivated to go public about their job because of their fears that such information could be misused. “There’s not much vetting of who works there, and the amount of data that we’re free to look through seems quite broad. It wouldn’t be difficult to identify the person that you’re listening to, especially with accidental triggers – addresses, names and so on.

“Apple is subcontracting out, there’s a high turnover. It’s not like people are being encouraged to have consideration for people’s privacy, or even consider it. If there were someone with nefarious intentions, it wouldn’t be hard to identify [people on the recordings].”

The contractor argued Apple should reveal to users this human oversight exists – and, specifically, stop publishing some of its jokier responses to Siri queries. Ask the personal assistant “are you always listening”, for instance, and it will respond with: “I only listen when you’re talking to me.”

That is patently false, the contractor said. They argued that accidental triggers are too regular for such a lighthearted response.

Apple is not alone in employing human oversight of its automatic voice assistants. In April, Amazon was revealed to employ staff to listen to some Alexa recordings, and earlier this month, Google workers were found to be doing the same with Google Assistant.

Apple differs from those companies in some ways, however. For one, Amazon and Google allow users to opt out of some uses of their recordings; Apple offers no similar choice short of disabling Siri entirely. According to Counterpoint Research, Apple has 35% of the smartwatch market, more than three times its nearest competitor Samsung, and more than its next six biggest competitors combined.

The company values its reputation for user privacy highly, regularly wielding it as a competitive advantage against Google and Amazon. In January, it bought a billboard at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas announcing that “what happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone”.",0.9705,
48,Technology,Which is the best tablet for an artist?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/jul/25/which-is-the-best-tablet-for-an-artist,2019-07-25T07:00:38Z,"If you’re an artist who uses computers, you’ve never had it so good, as former prime minister Harold Macmillan almost said. Touch-sensitive screens are becoming ubiquitous, so there are dozens of usable devices at a wide range of price points. However, they are not all the same, and people can be confused by the differences.

At first, artists mainly used graphics tablets connected to personal computers, with Wacom becoming the dominant brand. In this case, you draw on the tablet with a stylus and your pen-strokes appear on a separate screen. It’s a little like using a mouse.

Later we got drawing tablets, where the blank surface of the graphics tablet has been replaced with a screen. Wacom is still a major player with drawing tablets such as the Cintiq 13HD, but there are cheaper options. XP-Pen’s Artist16 Pro has been getting good reviews.

Graphics tablets and drawing tablets use the computing power of laptops or desktops, so they can handle the huge, detailed drawings required for architectural design and similar purposes. The tablet view may be just a window onto a much larger design.

Today, almost all smartphones and tablets, and most hybrid or convertible laptops, have touch screens, so you can draw on them with your fingers. A smaller number support pens. The key point is that they are standalone devices. They don’t need to be attached to a computer.

The leading examples fall into three main ranges: Samsung’s Galaxy Tab, Apple’s iPad Pro and Microsoft’s Surface Pro. There are alternatives, but these are the ones to beat.

From a drawing point of view, the important points include screen size and resolution, the colour accuracy of the screen, pen pressure levels and latency. Basically, if you press harder, the pen should produce a stronger line. A pressure sensitivity of 2,048 is recommended. I can’t tell the difference between 256, 1024 and 2048, but as an artist, your wife probably can.

Latency refers to the delay between the pen or stylus moving across the screen and a line appearing. Latency used to be terrible on tablets. It doesn’t seem to be a problem on the latest devices, though some apps are worse than others. The best way to check latency is to try a device. However, you can get a pretty good idea from watching people draw in YouTube videos.

Standalone tablets, unlike graphics tablets, can perform many other functions. You can do your email, watch videos, play games and so on. Some people will choose one tablet rather than another because it runs particular software – such as Adobe Creative Suite – or particular apps. Some will be influenced by how well it works with their other devices and online services, such as Office 365. Many will be influenced by price, though you haven’t given me a budget.

With hindsight, it would be a good idea to check how much it costs to replace the battery in the tablet you choose. All the main ranges have sealed-in batteries, which does not bode well for their longevity. Battery degradation is also a risk factor when buying second-hand devices.

As I’ve said before, it’s generally not worth changing systems unless you need to. When you switch, you give up a lot of valuable experience, you lose the comfort of familiarity, and you may have to find and learn a lot of new programs and/or apps. You shouldn’t switch unless the new system delivers one or more significant advantages – not minor ones that all its rivals will add in a year or so – and does not come with numerous disadvantages.

Your wife seems to be a happy Samsung Galaxy user. If she doesn’t have any real problems with her current device, and isn’t keen to try something new, your replacement should be as much like that as possible, only better.

The current top choice for Android users is the 10.5in Samsung Galaxy Tab S4, which includes an S Pen. Prices start at about £416 with 4GB of memory and 64GB of eMMC storage. It also has an SD card slot for easy expansion.

The S4 improves on the 9.7in S3 by offering a bigger screen with higher resolution, slimmer bezels, a faster processor and twice as much storage. However, the S3 is still a viable option if you want something cheaper. Artist blogger Teoh Yi Chie compares the S3 and S4 in a YouTube video, and in a more detailed post at Parka Blogs.

The 11in and 12.9in versions of the iPad Pro (2018) are the top models in Apple’s range, and they are great tablets, if money is no object. But they are expensive. With an entry-level 64GB of storage, the 11in Pro starts at £769 and the 12.9in at £969. The top-of-the-range 12.9in version maxes out at £1,719 for wifi only. I only spent £1,740 on my Dell XPS desktop PC, 4K (LG) monitor, convertible (Yoga) laptop and Android smartphone combined.

To the starting price, you would need to add an Apple Pencil 2 (£119), and possibly an SD card connector (£39) and a headphone jack converter (£9). You might also want the keyboard case (£199), AppleCare (£129) and some other dongles. It adds up, and for drawing, it’s silly money.

Fortunately, there are cheaper options. The 10.5in iPad Air (2019) is very much like the old iPad Pro (2017) but has a much faster processor, and it’s cheaper. The main things you lose are the “ProMotion display” refresh rate of up to 120 Hz – the iPad Air is a perfectly acceptable 60Hz – a couple of small speakers and a slightly worse rear camera (8MP instead of 12MP).

You could get a 10.5in iPad Air (2019) with 64GB of storage from Apple for £479, plus £89 for an Apple pencil and £29 for an SD card reader. Total price: £597.

Alternatively, an Apple pencil now works with a standard 9.7in iPad with 32GB of storage, which is good value at £319. A 9.7in iPad, Apple pencil and SD card reader comes to £437. That’s in the same ballpark as a 10.5in Galaxy Tab 4, though the Tab 4 has twice the storage and a bigger screen that packs in more pixels (2560 x 1600 vs 2048 x 1536).

Usually, someone would choose based on a need for certain apps or a preference for one of the operating systems. I think the iPad has more and better tablet apps. However, both systems seem to be about equally good for drawing, and your wife already knows how to use Android.

Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablets work well with pens, but they are clearly the third choice for any artist who doesn’t need Windows for other purposes. Like Apple, Microsoft also charges separately for pens and keyboard covers, so the final price may be higher than anticipated.

One interesting but decidedly odd device is Lenovo’s 10.1in Yoga Book convertible. This has two touch-screens: a colour screen for normal use, and a monochrome screen that doubles as a keyboard. You can also use the monochrome screen for writing and drawing. It has 2,048 levels of pressure sensitivity, so it might be quite good. (I only tried the keyboard; I didn’t like it.)

The Yoga Book started as a Windows machine, but Lenovo has switched to an Android version that only costs £299.99, including the pen.

The Yoga Book YB1-X90L shows its heritage in its Intel Atom x5-Z8550 processor, 4GB of memory, 64GB of storage and 1920 x 1200 screen resolution.

It’s not the best choice for your wife’s purposes. However, others could find uses for a 690g dual-screen Android laptop where one screen works as a colour tablet and the other lets you draw and make handwritten notes.

Incidentally, the upgraded version of the Windows device is the 10.8in Yoga Book C930, which combines a Quad HD colour touch-screen with an E-Ink touchscreen for £1,099.99. As before, both screens support pens.

49,Technology,"Best smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and ranked",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/06/best-smartphone-iphone-samsung-google-huawei-ios-android-buyers-guide-compared-ranked,2019-07-23T06:01:08Z,"Our updated list of the top iOS and Android mobile phones – at the best prices right now

Need a new smartphone but don’t know which one is the very best? Here’s a guide comparing the current top-end smartphones from Apple, Samsung, Huawei, OnePlus and others to help you pick the best handset for you.

There has never been a better time to buy a new flagship smartphone with many quality handsets available at a wider range of prices than ever before. Whether your priority is two-day battery life, fantastic camera performance or a spectacular screen, there’s plenty to choose from.

This Guardian buyer’s guide to top-end smartphones was last updated on 23 July 2019, and represents the best available models at the time. As new models are released and tested, this guide will be updated to help you choose the right flagship phone for you.

The latest superphone undercuts the competition on price while offering a better experience in almost every meaningful way. The OnePlus 7 Pro is the firm’s biggest yet with a monster 6.67in QHD+ AMOLED screen, which is arguably the best on any phone. It runs at a refresh rate of 90Hz – compared with 60Hz for the competition – which makes everything from scrolling through lists to smashing through games super slick.

The screen is edge-to-edge in every direction too, lacking any intrusions by the notches plaguing rivals as the selfie camera has been moved to a motorised module that pops out of the top of the phone when needed.

Speed is the name of the game. The OnePlus 7 Pro is the fastest-feeling smartphone by miles. Part of that is the firm’s excellent version of Android 9 Pie called OxygenOS, which is on-par with Google’s on the Pixels, and the other is the top-of-the-line hardware.

It has Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 855 processor, at least 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. But that storage is also much faster than rivals using the new UFS3.0 standard, and the difference in day-to-day usage is palpable.

Even the optical in-display fingerprint scanner is the best in the business, beating that on the Huawei P30 Pro and matching traditional capacitive sensors for speed.

The triple camera system on the back matches rivals combining a 48MP main, a 16MP ultra-wide angle and an 8MP telephoto camera. It can’t beat the P30 Pro, but it matches or beats the rest on detail and utility.

Battery life is good, but not Huawei-beating. It charges really fast using OnePlus’s WarpCharge system, but there’s no wireless charging, which is a shame. It is water resistant to some extent, but doesn’t have an IP rating. It has dual-sim support in most markets too.

The OnePlus 7 Pro also comes in a 5G version too, which is single-sim only but is the same size, weight and performance as the 4G-only version and is available exclusively from EE in the UK starting at £170 with a 24-month £59/month plan.

Why should you buy it?

The unrivalled screen, sheer speed and in-display fingerprint scanner, combined with the slick OxygenOS, make even mundane tasks a joy. The massive OnePlus 7 Pro is most definitely a stretch to use, but it’s a stretch worth making

Buy if: you want the best and fastest superphone experience

Don’t buy if: you don’t want to stretch to such a big phone
• None Full review: OnePlus 7 Pro review: an absolute beast in every way

The best iPhone is not the biggest or most expensive. The iPhone XS combines a stunning, good-size 5.8in screen, svelte body and top-notch performance into the most appealing package from Apple to date.

Apple’s Face ID is the best face recognition system in the business, the dual-camera system on the back is excellent, as is the performance of the A12 Bionic processor and the class-leading gesture navigation system of iOS, which has replaced the home button of iPhones of yore.

You’re also in line for about five years of software updates, which is likely at least two more than any other brand of phone. The iPhone XS is a metal and glass sandwich, and will smash just like the competition when dropped, but the stainless steel sides and glass back exude a luxury feel not matched by other phones. Sadly most will put it in a case.

The biggest downsides are the price, which at £1,000 is likely significantly more than the competition, and battery life, which only manages about a day of medium usage. The iPhone XS has wireless charging and supports fast charging via a USB-C to Lightning cable, but only ships with a slow charger in the box. Its cellular modem performance is also not as good as competitors, struggling more to keep a working 4G data connection in congested areas, particularly compared with the Mate 20 Pro.

Why should you buy it?

If you’re locked in to iOS, or want the longest software update coverage, then the iPhone XS is the best Apple smartphone you can buy (and not very far behind the Mate 20 Pro overall), thanks to its combination of size, camera, capability and luxurious feel.

Buy if: you want the best iPhone

Don’t buy if: you don’t want to spend £999 or want to use Android

If you want the sweet-spot between a big, stunning screen and smaller phone size that’s easier to handle and fit in a pocket, that’s the Galaxy S10.

The 6.1in QHD+ AMOLED screen with a small hole-punch notch in the top right is one of the very best on the market and is big enough to make the most of apps and movies look great.

Small bezels all round make the phone pretty compact compared to rivals, and it’s light too. It’s still a glass and metal sandwich, which means you might need a case to protect against falls.

The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor mounted under the display works well, although it’s no longer the fastest on the market.

Samsung’s new One UI software, based on Android 9 Pie, is a big leap in making large phone easier to use, putting things you have to touch toward the bottom of the screen and information towards the top. Samsung also gives you the choice of traditional navigation keys or swipe gestures.

You should see around three-years of software support from Samsung, although the company is often slow to deliver big Android version updates.

The rear triple camera is one of the best allowing you to zoom from 0.5 through 2x, and on to a 10x hybrid zoom. It won’t beat the Huawei P30 Pro, but it keeps up with rest. The selfie camera pokes straight though the screen and is one of the best on the market.

Performance is good, but battery life is the S10’s one weakness. It will last a day of usage but not much more. There’s both cable and fast wireless charging to top up during the day and the wireless power share feature turns the phone into an ad-hoc wireless charger for other devices.

Why should you buy it?

The big, beautiful screen in a comparatively small phone is the main selling point, but the good camera, performance and looks help too

Buy if: you want the best balance of big screen and small phone

Don’t buy if: you want brilliant battery life

The best camera on a phone is the Huawei P30 Pro by some margin. No other phone provides as comprehensive a combination as Huawei’s new Leica quad camera.

The 20MP 0.6x ultra-wide angle camera is fun, the main 1x 40MP camera is terrific and it’s joined by a new periscopic 5x optical zoom camera that gets you closer than any other smartphone. If five times magnification wasn’t enough, there’s an excellent 10x hybrid zoom on top and then a digital zoom all the way up to 50x. A 3D depth-sensing time-of-flight sensor rounds out the modules on the back.

Remarkable levels of zoom aside, the P30 Pro also has game-changing low-light performance that instantly turns night into day without having to wait for a couple of seconds of capture.

The rest of the phone is excellent too with stunning colour options. The large 6.47in FHD+ OLED is one of the best, with a small notch in the top containing the selfie camera and slim bezels all-round. The curved edges keep the width of the phone to a narrow 73.4mm wide, meaning it’s still relatively manageable and easier to wield day-to-day particularly compared to the OnePlus 7 Pro or iPhone XS Max.

The in-screen optical fingerprint sensor is second only to the OnePlus 7 Pro’s. Huawei’s top-notch Kirin 980 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, provides great performance and a battery that’ll last around two days. Plus charges the fastest and has wireless charging and power sharing.

Huawei’s modified Android 9 Pie, EMUI 9.1, is highly customisable and has plenty of features but may not be to everyone’s tastes. Huawei is currently facing sanctions from the US as part of the US-China trade war, which makes its future uncertain. The P30 Pro should continue to receive updates as normal, however.

Why should you buy it?

The camera is game-changing in meaningful, not gimmick-filled ways, while the rest of the phone is excellent

Buy if: you want the best camera on a great phone

Don’t buy if: you want a smaller phone or are worried about US blockade of Huawei

If you want big screen, top-spec phone, but don’t want a monster of a phone or to spend £900, then the OnePlus 7 is the one to buy.

It has a good-looking 6.41in full HD OLED screen, a widow’s peak-like notch for the selfie camera, slim bezels all round and a premium-feeling metal and glass body matching the quality of others.

It has 2019’s top-of-the-line Snapdragon 855 processor, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of the faster UFS3.0 storage, just like the OnePlus 7 Pro. It also lasts a good 34 hours on a charge, and its Oxygen OS Android software is fast and slick. OnePlus guarantees two years of software updates and an additional year of bi-monthly security updates from the release date of the phone too.

It even has the fastest and best in-display fingerprint scanner currently available, which is as good as the best dedicated capacitive sensors, good haptics and dual-sim support for having two mobile phone network connections at the same time.

The downsides are a camera that lacks ultra-wide or zoom capabilities, no formal water resistance rating and no wireless charging. You can have it in any colour you like in the UK, as long as that colour is mirror grey. Fetching red and blue versions are available in India and China. It’s also not available in the US, where the previous model the OnePlus 6T is still on sale instead.

Why should you buy it?

A great screen with slim bezels, excellent software and the best performance, in-display fingerprint scanner and a good camera mean you have to spend significantly more to get a better phone than this

Buy if: you want a top-notch phone but don’t want to spend more than £500

Don’t buy if: you want a really good camera

These are good phones still worth buying if none of the top four smartphones fit the bill.

Apple’s slightly cheaper iPhone XR offers most of the features of the iPhone XS. It has better battery life too, but has a worse camera, a slightly larger, but worse screen and is made of aluminium and glass, instead of stainless steel, losing its luxurious feel and the knowledge that it’s the best Apple can make.

The iPhone XR looks stunning in red, but it’s not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, costing as much or more as true flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone XS still the one to buy if you want an iPhone, but if you want to save money, switch to Android.

If you must have an iPhone and it must have a massive screen, then the iPhone XS Max is your only option. But it’s even more expensive and bigger and heavier, making it pretty difficult to handle day-to-day, meaning the smaller iPhone XS is the better option.

The smallest, cheapest variant of Samsung’s current S10 line is still good, but falls slightly short of the high bar set by the regular Galaxy S10. The Galaxy S10e loses the optical zoom with only two cameras on the back, has a flat, slightly smaller screen and a lower capacity battery. It also ditches in the in-screen fingerprint scanner for one embedded in the power button – great for right-handed users but not so for the left handed.

It doesn’t feel any smaller in the hand, but can be had for less if you must have a top-end Samsung for the lowest possible cost or dislike curved screens.

The bigger version of the Galaxy S10 with a 6.4in QHD+ display has the best screen available on any device. The oval-shaped hole-punch notch is novel, containing two good selfie cameras. The triple rear camera is good, but not a patch on the Huawei P30 Pro. Performance is good, so is the software, but the battery life is slightly disappointing compared with the best.

Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9 offers something a bit different, with long battery life, a massive screen and the all-important S Pen stylus. If you’re looking for a productivity powerhouse, the Note 9 is it. But it’s also huge with a slightly dated design.

The Mate 20 Pro has the big, attractive 6.39in QHD+ screen, svelte body, long battery life and great performance that made it the top phone of 2018. However, its excellent triple camera system with 3x optical zoom has been outdone by Huawei’s newer P30 Pro, which has a Leica quad camera with 5x optical zoom. It is worth looking out for deals, particularly if you want the 3D face unlock option.

Huawei’s Honor brand has made a name for itself cut-price but good phones. The View20 is the best phone it has ever made and is cracking value at just £500.

It has a top-of-the-line Huawei Kirin 980 processor (as seen in the Mate 20 Pro), a good-looking 6.4in FHD+ LCD screen, plenty of storage, 6 or 8GB of RAM, a super-quick fingerprint scanner on the back and it even still has a headphone socket. Standout features are a hole-punch notch in the screen, through which an excellent 25MP selfie camera pokes, and a really great 48MP camera on the back.

Fast charging, long battery life, great in-hand feel and a wild light-reflecting V-shaped pattern in the glass back round out the highlights. Honor’s Magic UI 2, based on Android 9 Pie, is not quite as good as OnePlus’s OxygenOS, but at least you get two to three years of updates.

Out of the two £500 top-end phones, buy the Honor View20 if you want a better camera; buy the OnePlus 6T if you want a better user experience and software.
• None Full review: Honor View20 review: top phone at half the cost of an iPhone XS

The Pixel 3 is all about Google’s camera and software. The 5.5in OLED screen is small by 2019’s standards and has large bezels at the top and bottom, which make the phone bigger than it needs to be and give it a dated look.

But Google’s fantastic single rear camera, excellent software and fast updates are worth buying into. Performance is good but battery life is a bit weak. Buy if you want a smaller phone and the Samsung Galaxy S10 isn’t for you.
• None Full review: Google Pixel 3 review: raising the bar for the Android experience

The larger Google Pixel 3 XL has everything that makes the Pixel 3 a really great phone, but is bigger with a huge notch at the top of the screen. It’s more difficult to handle than its smaller sibling and is more expensive, but has slightly better battery life. If you like the Pixel 3 but want a bigger screen, this is the phone for you, but on the whole the smaller version is a better device for most people. The Mate 20 Pro is a better big-screen phone all round.

Xiaomi’s first slider phone offers more than most for the money, with top-flight specs for 2018 competing directly with the OnePlus 6T and Honor View20. It takes a different approach to the problem of where to put the selfie camera in an all-screen design, hiding it behind the screen on slide-out section.

Good, but quite as great as its competition, this huge phone is held back by a heavy weight and a software experience that just isn’t as good, despite solid gesture navigation options.

Razer Phone 2 - Gaming phone beast that falls down on camera performance – £500

Sony Xperia XZ3 – Good, but not great phone that misses the mark – £699

LG G7 – uninspiring design and software that’s not as good as rivals – £375

50,Technology,What's the best mini-laptop for YouTube and writing reports?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/jul/18/whats-the-best-mini-laptop-for-youtube-and-writing-reports,2019-07-18T07:00:21Z,"BlackBerry lost its premier position in the market – when its phones were used by everyone from Paris Hilton to then US president Barack Obama – but you can still buy BlackBerry phones. The company licensed its name and technology to China’s TCL Communication Technology Holdings Limited (TCT), which sells phones under the TCL, BlackBerry Mobile and Alcatel brand names. It also makes TV sets, soundbars, headphones, air conditioners and dehumidifiers. (The BlackBerry name has also been used by Optiemus Infracom, selling phones as BlackBerry Mobile India, and BB Merah Putih, which briefly served the Indonesian market.)

In 2013, BlackBerry tried to replace its original operating system with a new version, BlackBerry 10, based on the QNX operating system it bought in 2010. This is used in the BlackBerry Classic and BlackBerry Passport smartphones. However, in 2015, it started to move to Google Android with the Priv and DTEK50 models.

You can still buy BlackBerry Mobile phones in the UK, including ones with physical keyboards, but they all run Android. While they have security and other features that could appeal to businesses, consumers can buy faster Android phones with bigger screens for less money.

You are a long-time BlackBerry fan so you might consider buying a new BlackBerry Classic for £166.48 on Amazon. However, it’s still a five-year-old phone, the keyboard no longer has the “smile” shape, and I can’t see a dedicated full stop key. Its square 3.5in screen is unsuitable for YouTube and most mobile web pages, but this is why you’re looking for a mini-laptop as well.

Either way, I wouldn’t recommend a BlackBerry Classic to the average consumer, who would be better off with, for example, a Motorola G7 for £179.99. (There are hundreds of alternatives.) The G7 has a 6.24in screen, which is just about big enough for YouTube. The on-screen keyboard works well, though Google’s voice recognition is so good you should rarely need it.

For serious report writing, you can always pack an external Bluetooth keyboard. I use my Moto G6 with an old Microsoft Universal Mobile Keyboard, which has since been superseded by a foldable version. Again, there are many alternatives.

In the good old days, many of us carried Palm and Compaq iPaq PDAs (personal digital assistants) that enabled us to work on the move. The Psion Series 5 was a classic because it had such a good keyboard. The last one I had was, I think, an HP Jornada 720 with a 6.5in colour screen. It was great for writing, and much less cumbersome than my old Filofax.

I don’t think PDAs will ever retake the mass market, because large smartphones and small tablets have filled that hole. However, there is still some interest in mini-laptops, which can now reach enthusiasts via Kickstarter and Indiegogo campaigns.

The Gemini PDA, from UK-based Planet Computers, is an attempt to recreate something like the Psion Series 5. The basic machine does the same job for £499 – you can type while on the move – but there’s a £599 version that also works as a 4G smartphone.

The Gemini has a 6in screen and runs Android, so it could be a good alternative to a standard Android phone with a 6in to 6.5in screen and a Bluetooth keyboard. It also dual-boots to Linux, so you can run full web browsers and productivity software such as LibreOffice. Unfortunately for those of us who live in Microsoft Office, it doesn’t run Windows 10, which is a bit of a shame as Microsoft’s operating system is free on small-screen devices.

As mentioned in a recent answer, there are a few mini-laptops that do run Windows 10. These include the GPD Pocket 2, One Mix Yoga, One Mix 1S, and One Mix 2S. The GeekBuying website sells at least seven examples at prices from £328.79 to £588.54. The cheap ones have Intel Atom (Cherry Trail) processors while the expensive ones have Core m3 chips.

All of these mini-laptops have a screen resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, so they can run Windows 10 properly. (Old-style 7in netbooks – popular between 2007 and 2011 – had 1024 x 768-pixel screens.) But you would have to use scaling to make text comfortable to read.

Netbooks succeeded because the versions with 7in screens, 1GB of memory and a cut-price version of Windows XP were familiar enough to be accessible, and they were cheap. However, most people wanted bigger screens – they quickly increased to about 10in – more memory and more storage. This closed the price gap to “proper” laptops, and the netbook market collapsed.

The next generation of mini-laptops arrived with the Asus Transformer (which originally ran Android), Lenovo’s Miix range (now discontinued), the Acer One and similar machines. Most of them had 10.1in screens, and some – such as the Asus T101HA and Acer One 10 – had a screen resolution of only 1280 x 800 pixels. Most were cheap because they had only 2GB of memory and 32GB of slow eMMC chip storage, which is much the same as a built-in SD Card.

As with netbooks and Chromebooks, the idea is that users won’t need powerful processors or local storage because they will use online applications and save all their data online. In theory, this is still the case. You could therefore consider a laptop like an Acer One 10 at £229.86, or even a Thomson Neo 10 at £99.95, but I wouldn’t recommend it. Today, 32GB of storage is not really enough to support Windows 10 updates, and you’d be better off with at least 4GB of memory. The 7in mini-laptops mentioned above all have 8GB.

Most of today’s mini-laptops and convertibles now have even bigger screens, typically from 11.6in to 14in. I have 10.1in, 11.6in and 12in convertibles, and I’ve found that the combination of the extra screen area and higher resolution makes a worthwhile difference to usability. However, at 12in and above, you start to lose portability.

Here are three mini-laptops to consider. First, there’s the Asus VivoBook E203MA (search for E203MA-FD017TS), which is the latest version of a machine that’s been around for some time. It has an 11.6in screen, 4GB of memory and 64GB of storage. Its advantages are that it’s light at 0.99kg, and great value at £229.99. Its main drawback is its slow Intel Celeron N4000 processor (Passmark benchmark score: 1,436).

Second, there’s the robust Acer TravelMate B118 (search for NX.VHSEK.004), which is aimed at the education market. It has an 11.6in screen, 4GB of memory and 64GB of storage. Its main appeal is the reasonably nippy quad-core Pentium N5000 processor (Passmark score: 2,433), but it’s a bit heavy at 1.53kg. It’s good value at £244.97 and not too bad at £288.54.

The third is Microsoft’s Surface Go, reviewed here in October. This is a 10in touch tablet with an optional Type Cover keyboard and pen. It appeals because of its light weight (0.56kg without keyboard) and high quality 1800 x 1200 screen. Its Pentium Gold 4415Y processor (Passmark score: 2,229) is relatively slow compared to a Surface Pro, but good enough for your purposes. Prices start at £369 at Argos or Currys PC World. Even better, splash out £465 on a Surface Go with 8GB of memory and a faster 128GB SSD.

Any of these would slip in your bag, while also being capable of doing real work writing reports.

51,Technology,OnePlus 7 review: competition-beating performance for less,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/17/oneplus-7-review-competition-beating-performance-for-less,2019-07-17T05:01:08Z,"A little less ‘Pro’ means the regular OnePlus 7 is smaller and lighter, offering a top experience for £500

The OnePlus 7 is basically the OnePlus 6T with the guts of the OnePlus 7 Pro, which sounds like a bad thing, but for £500 it is arguably the best bang for your buck going.

There was nothing wrong with the design of the 6T, so there isn’t with the 7. The 6.41in AMOLED display is bright and crisp, filling most of the front of the phone with a small chin at the bottom and a teardrop notch in the top for the selfie camera.

It’s still one of the best-looking designs available, but the notch is more intrusive than the holepunch design of the Honor 20 or similar, and not quite on the same level as the OnePlus 7 Pro.

The phone is only available in mirror grey in the UK, which is super-shiny with a slight purple tint to it. It looks sleek but is a bit of a fingerprint magnet. A mirror blue version is available in India, while a red version is available in India and China.

The rear glass isn’t as slippery as other phones, which combined with its curved back and relatively narrow 74.8mm width makes the OnePlus 7 one of the easiest of the large metal-and-glass sandwiches to hold.

For comparison, the OnePlus 7 is 24g lighter, 1.1mm narrower and 4.9mm shorter than the larger OnePlus 7 Pro, but 7g heavier than the similarly sized Samsung Galaxy S10+. The rest of the dimensions compare favourably to the competition.

The OnePlus 7 has the same potent combination of Qualcomm’s range-topping Snapdragon 855 processor, 6GB or 8GB of RAM and 128GB or 256GB of UFS3.0 storage, which is significantly faster than the older UFS2.1 storage commonly used by others.

As such, the phone flies. Day-to-day tasks are super-fast and slick, and gaming is great. It doesn’t feel quite as fast as the OnePlus 7 Pro because it lacks the 90Hz screen, but it’s really not that far off.

Battery life is also good, lasting 34 hours between charges with medium to heavy usage: 200 or so emails, messages and push notifications, a couple of hours of browsing in Chrome, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 90 minutes of Futurama from Google Play, a 20-minute phone call and about 15 photos.

That meant the OnePlus 7 would make it from 7am on day one until 4pm on day two, or longer with lighter use or one of the power-saving modes active.

There’s no wireless charging, but OnePlus’s included fast charging tech will hit 80% in 50 minutes and a full battery in 90 minutes.

Oxygen OS 9.5 is the company’s latest customised version of Android 9 Pie and is nearly identical on both the OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro, with only a few small changes since version 9 on the OnePlus 6T.

OxygenOS is a refined version of standard Android, with a focus on speed and fluidity, and a few more customisation options than you’d find on a Google Pixel or similar. As such, it is one of the best versions of Android you can get, and you can look forward to three years of software updates from release, including bi-monthly security updates.

OnePlus gives you the choice of choice standard three-button Android navigation keys, Google’s “pill” navigation button or gestures, which are smooth – swipe up from the centre to go home, up and hold for recently-used apps, or up and over to the right for the previously-used app. The back gesture, up from the left or right bottom edge, isn’t as easy to use as Huawei’s swipe in from the left or right side of the screen, which is also being adopted by Google for Android Q.

Oxygen OS also comes with Zen Mode (a time out for your phone), a gaming mode and RAM boost, which learns the apps you use frequently and pre-caches them into RAM. There’s also no real one-handed mode, though, which others such as Huawei include, which would have been helpful.

The fingerprint scanner is in the same position – under the display in the lower fifth of the screen – as the OnePlus 6T but has been dramatically sped up for fast, accurate unlocks that rival traditional capacitive fingerprint scanners.

It matches the one on the OnePlus 7 Pro as the best in the business at the moment – everything else feels slow.

The OnePlus 7 has the same main camera as the 7 Pro, but lacks the ultra-wide angle and telephoto cameras, instead having a 5MP depth assist camera for portrait mode shots.

The main camera is just as good as the 7 Pro, capturing some really detailed and well-exposed shots. Both smartphones have seen a barrage of recent software updates that have improved the cameras – something that’s very good to see. It won’t match the Google Pixel 3 or 3A for image quality, but most will be very pleased. Low light performance and the dedicated Nightscape mode are good but not quite class-leading.

Zoom is relegated to up to 10x digital, which can’t hold a flame to optical zoom, but is fine in a pinch. Video capture is pretty good at up to 4K60Hz, as is the selfie camera, which captures more detail than most might want. Three levels of beauty mode are available for those that want a little smoothing out of lifelines.
• None The screen comes with a pre-installed screen protector, which creates a sharp edge at the bottom of the phone you can feel when using swiping gestures
• None The OnePlus alert slider on the side of the phone continues to be wonderful
• None The included TPU case is one of the best I’ve seen bundled with a phone
• None The camera lump on the back is large, and I felt it more often when holding the device than with previous OnePlus phones

The OnePlus 7 costs £499 for 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, or £549 for 8GB and 256GB.

For comparison, the 128GB OnePlus 7 Pro costs £699, the 128GB Huawei P30 Pro costs £899, the 128GB Huawei Mate 20 Pro costs £599, the 128GB Samsung Galaxy S10+ costs £899, the 64GB Google Pixel 3 XL costs £869, and the 64GB iPhone XS Max costs £1,099.

From the highs of the OnePlus 7 Pro, the “non-Pro” OnePlus 7 may look like a consolation prize, but in many ways the OnePlus 7 is better because it holds true to the winning OnePlus formula: exceptional bang for your buck.

It’s smaller and lighter, which makes it easier to use while still being a big-screen phone. It’s just as powerful, has the same great software and same smooth performance, and has a longer battery life than its Pro sibling.

It even has the same unrivalled in-screen fingerprint sensor and great main camera. But if you were looking for a multi-camera, zoom in and out affair, this isn’t it. And while the screen looks great, it isn’t the same game-changing, addictively silky smooth display on the OnePlus 7 Pro.

What you get for your £500 with the OnePlus 7 is a brilliant phone with an experience unrivalled anywhere near this price. It’s so good that there are only a few non-5G phones I would consider over this, and even then it’s a close call.

52,Technology,Honor 20 review: Huawei's first new phone during Trump dispute,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/10/honor-20-review-huaweis-first-new-phone-during-trump-dispute,2019-07-10T06:00:21Z,"Top performance and a good camera make the £400 Honor 20 tempting. But will the US-China trade war hit software updates?

The Honor 20 is the first smartphone launched and put on sale by Huawei since Trump’s blacklisting of the company in May.

In effect this is one of the phones Trump tried to ban, but as it happened the Honor 20 had already passed through the Android certification process before Google was forced to stop working with Huawei.

In reality, Trump’s actions have had little to no effect on the £400 Honor 20, other than a slight delay in release in the west, and now there is an expectation that at least some of the restrictions will be lifted by Trump.

The phone itself treads a tried and trusted formula: glass all-screen on the front, metal sides and a glass back. It weighs 174g, which is fairly light compared with the 200g-plus large phones, and its 7.9mm thickness compares favourably with rivals.

The screen is also smaller than some recent gigantic rivals, at just 6.26in on the diagonal, which is welcome. Phones have become too big recently.

Because the Honor 20’s screen is flat, not curving at the sides to the metal edge, the phone is a little wider at 74mm than the screen size might suggest – 0.6mm wider than the Huawei P30 Pro with its larger 6.47in screen. Still, it feels slick in the hand and is relatively easy to use.

The FHD+ LCD screen itself is excellent, crisp, bright and colourful, with slim bezels, a hole punched in the top left corner through which the selfie camera pokes and good viewing angles all round. It can’t match the top OLED displays, but then it doesn’t cost £500-plus.

The design is, however, a little dull, particularly in black compared with some of the flashier phones in 2019, including the Honor View20. Get it in blue for something a bit more interesting.

There’s no headphone socket and the fingerprint scanner is under the power button on the right hand side. It’s fast, accurate and easy to reach with your right thumb, but less so with your left index fingers. Left-handed users might want to think twice before buying.
• None Connectivity: USB-C (2.0), LTE, wifi, NFC, Bluetooth 5 and GPS (dual-sim available in some regions)

Huawei has a knack for making fast but power efficient processors and equipping lots of phones at various prices with the same top-of-the-range chips. The Honor 20 uses the same Kirin 980 chip as all of Huawei’s top-flight phones and performs just as well.

Technically it is a generation behind the top Snapdragon 855 chip from Qualcomm that’s used in most other 2019 flagship phones, including the OnePlus 7 Pro, but the performance differences are only noticeable in the most graphically intensive games that do not support Huawei’s GPU Turbo optimisations.

So what you get is top-level performance at a mid-range price, which puts the likes of the similarly priced Google Pixel 3a XL to shame.

Huawei, and therefore Honor, phones are the current battery life kings. The Honor 20 is no exception.

With medium to heavy usage the phone lasted about 32 hours between charges, meaning it would make it all the way from 7am on day one until 3pm on day two.

That was while using the Honor 20 as my primary device with lots of email, messages and push notifications, a couple of hours browsing in Chrome, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 90 minutes of Futurama from Google Play, a 30-minute phone call and about 20 photos.

The Honor 20 lacks wireless charging but has relatively fast cable charging, reaching 80% in an hour and a full charge in under 90 minutes using the included power adapter and cable.

The Honor 20 runs the latest of Magic UI 2.1, which is the firm’s version of Android 9 Pie. Magic UI 2.1 is essentially a renamed version of parent company Huawei’s EMUI 9.1, which is the software running on Huawei’s top phone, the P30 Pro.

Overall Magic UI 2.1 is a highly capable version of Android with a solid set of navigation gestures or traditional navigation buttons, lots of power saving features and long-term performance functions that keep it from being slowed down over time.

The interface isn’t as slick or as fluid as that running on a OnePlus or Google’s Pixel phones, but it is getting better with each update. The trouble is the updates have been fairly slow in the past, but Honor said it will be keeping to a bi-monthly security update schedule (Google releases an Android security patch once a month) and expects a major update in mid-August with Android Q.

Honor says it is “confident” that it can update the 20 with Android Q. However, given the complexities of US export law, it may not be up to Honor and Huawei as to whether it can legally honour that commitment.

The Honor 20 has an evolved version of the excellent camera from the View 20. The phone technically has four cameras on the back: one 48MP standard camera, a 16MP super-wide angle camera, a 2MP fixed focus macro camera and a 2MP depth assist camera.

However, the depth camera is just that, an assistant helping produce bokeh effects in portrait mode, not a camera in its own right. And while the macro camera sounds like a fun idea, the images produced are poor. Superficially they look fine, but zoom in at all on the image and you’ll see a mess of over-sharpened pixels.

Forget about two of the cameras and you’re left with the main 48MP camera which is great, producing shots with high levels of detail, good range and colour. Low-light performance is pretty good too. It even produces better macro shots than the dedicated macro camera.

The ultra-wide angle camera is also a lot of fun to use, turning those short-range landscape photos into large, expansive shots. It has noticeably worse middling-to-low light performance than the main camera, though, so best left for outdoor shots in good light.

The one thing missing is an optical zoom; instead you get up to 10x digital zoom, which is pretty good but no match for anything with a 2 or 3x telephoto camera. Video capture is limited to 30FPS at 4K too.

The camera app is pretty good, and Honor’s AI system has toned down a lot since its inception, meaning I felt comfortable to leave it on.

The front-facing 32MP camera pokes through a hole in the screen and is really very good, capturing detail-rich selfies even in fairly challenging lighting conditions.
• None The phone is pretty slippery so you’ll need a case to keep it from dropping out of shallow pockets when you sit down
• None The vibration motor is not as good as rivals in 2019, feeling baggy and imprecise
• None The frame of the phone traps hairs and fluff
• None Call quality was good, but the speaker is fairly small needing a bit of attention to get the correct alignment with your ear
• None The phone curiously dropped to 3G more often in 4G areas than competing devices

The Honor 20 costs £399 in either black or blue.

For comparison, the Honor View20 costs £500, the OnePlus 7 costs £499, the Huawei P30 Pro costs £899, the Samsung Galaxy S10e costs £669 and the Apple iPhone XR costs £749.

The Honor 20 is another cracking, well specified, solid performing, well made phone from Huawei. It’s got the same top-end Kirin 980 chip as the excellent P30 Pro, long battery life and good screen.

The camera is also pretty good, if you ignore the quad-camera hype and concentrate on the main and wide-angle cameras on the back.

The Magic UI 2.1 software is even pretty good too, but it’s impossible to look at the Honor 20 in isolation. The Trump factor and whether Huawei, and therefore, Honor will continue to have access to Google for crucial Android updates and the certificates needed for anything from DRM in video apps to Google Pay looms large.

You’d need a crystal ball to know for sure, but the expectation is that Huawei will eventually be tied into a deal between the US and China at the end of this trade war.

For now, the Honor 20 offers a nearly top-flight experience for just £400, which is a great deal. But it’s a great deal that could easily sour if things don’t go Huawei’s way.

53,Technology,Bose Frames review: smart audio sunglasses are a blast,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/08/bose-frames-review-smart-audio-sunglasses-are-a-blast,2019-07-08T06:00:16Z,"Music without earbuds looks and sounds surprisingly good, making these smart glasses the antithesis of Google Glass

The Bose Frames are the answer to the question: what if your sunglasses were also a set of smart, hidden headphones with no earbuds or no bone-conduction system, just a set of personal speakers?

As a wearer of true wireless earbuds, that’s not a question I ever thought I would ask. But the Bose Frames are delightful and leaving your ears free of buds or headphones has a clear and obvious case.

The term “smart glasses”’ might conjure up visions of Google’s ill-fated Glass, but the Bose Frames are not in the same league. There’s no screen, camera or any visible signs of “smart” from the front. Instead they have built-in sensors and a pair of hidden speakers, which pipe music to your ears.

Bose has nailed the design of the Frames. They look like regular unisex sunglasses. Granted, the arms are a bit thicker and wider near the ears, where traditional sunglasses would taper, and there’s a small gold button for turning them on and controlling music. But I was happy wearing them when not listening to music.

There’s a choice of two frames: the larger, squarer Alto (as tested) and the smaller, rounder Rondo. Both are made from black nylon, come with black lenses and look fairly generic.

Other lenses are available as optional accessories, including a set of mirrored polarised (£30) or blue gradient (£20), which pop in and out easily enough with a bit of light force applied to the lens. But that’s about as far as customisation goes. Prescription lenses are coming, but aren’t available in the UK yet.

They’re comfortable to wear for extended periods without pinching on the nose or ears, and fold up just like any regular set. They weigh 45g, which is about the weight of a thicker set of premium sunglasses.

If I was to nitpick I would say that the black frames look a little cheap and almost too generic. But the fact that’s even worth mentioning is testament to how not like other smart glasses the Frames are.

How they work and sound

The glasses sound amazingly good for what they are. Two small speakers sit in the frame just in front of your ears. The music is directed straight to your ear through small speaker grilles, while cancelling sound is projected out into the world. The result is a sound leakage of about 1%, according to Bose.

In the real world if you have the volume below 50% people sitting right next to you won’t hear it. In fact I took delight in the look of surprise on people’s faces when I gave them the Frames and they suddenly heard my tunes blasting out as they put them on. It’s really very impressive.

In terms of raw sound quality, the Frames sound like a very open set of quality earbuds. They lack deep bass, but give them something complex and they shine with energy and warmth, with excellent separation and clarity.

Crank them up beyond 85% volume and you start to hear distortion, but they pretty loud by that point. Most of my listening was about at 60% on the street or about 30% in quieter spots.

The one thing the Frames can’t do that earbuds can is protect you from the loud din of a city. You can forget hearing music on a screeching train or while walking by a working jackhammer. In this regard they are very much like Apple’s popular AirPods.

The Frames support standard Bluetooth audio (SBC) as well as the higher quality AAC audio, and had rock-solid connectivity with both Android phones and the iPhone. No noticeable lipsync issues were present either, which made the Frames great for watching video.

The microphone was surprisingly good, picking up my voice clearly for the other end of the call (or Google Assistant/Siri). Be warned though: with no earbuds visible people think you’re talking to yourself.

Turning on the Frames is as easy as pressing the single discreet button under the right arm. The button also serves for pause/play or accepting a call. Double press to skip forward, triple for back. Anyone who has used wireless earbuds before will be familiar with this.

To switch them off just turn them upside down for a second or so. It all works great. The one thing they’re missing is volume control, so you’ll be reaching for your phone for that, which is a shame.

You get just over three hours of continuous listening out of the Frames before the battery runs dry, which is normally enough. Charging is fairly slow and needs a proprietary magnetic USB cable that snaps on to the inside of the right arm.

The Frames come with a traditional sunglasses case, which is a missed opportunity. Most true wireless earbuds last about three hours, but are charged multiple times by their case. The Frames could really do with a battery in the case. It’s too easy to forget to charge them, turning them into standard sunglasses.

The smart bit of the Frames is support for the firm’s audio augmented reality platform, Bose AR, which is also available on the Bose’s popular QC35 II headphones, and on the upcoming Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700.

The Frames know which way you’re facing and your location from the GPS on your phone, so you can use audio to feed information about the real world into your ears.

But the platform only supports iOS at the moment and lacks a killer app. The best of the bunch are some 3D audio experiences, a golf app that can tell you where the hole is and some walking directions. None of them were interesting enough to use beyond novelty, but Bose AR has potential.
• None The USB cable comes in a small microfibre bag lose in the case with the Frames, which makes getting them out a bit clumsy
• None There’s no microfibre bag for the Frames included, which would make using them and keeping them clean while out and about a bit easier
• None Apple’s Face ID works through both the black and mirrored silver polarised lenses
• None Google Assistant/Siri is really good through the Frames
• None Polarised lenses have an odd tendency to distort the pavement, making it look less flat than it really is

The Bose Frames Alto cost £199.95 with black lenses, with gradient blue lenses costing £19.95 and mirrored silver polarised lenses costing £29.95 as optional extras.

The Bose Frames Rondo cost £199.95 with black lenses, with gradient blue lenses costing £19.95 and mirrored rose gold polarised lenses costing £29.95 as optional extras.

For comparison, the Oakley Radar Pace, which has in-ear buds attached to the sunglasses, costs £400 while various bone conduction sunglasses cost from about £100.

The Bose Frames are delightful – a set of premium sunglasses that also act as your personal music system. Kept to 50% or lower those next to you can’t hear your music, but because your ears are open you can hear the world around you.

Clearly this is a massive advantage for cyclists or pedestrians, but it also means you’re subjected to the noise of the world around you. For anyone who always walks around with earbuds in, as I do, this can be quite overwhelming when you first start out.

They look good enough that I ended up wearing them even when not listening to music. And when you do switch them on they sound surprisingly good, with rich audio that sparkles with the right track. There’s simply no comparison with bone conduction or similar other non-earbud personal audio technologies.

Listening to your tunes while still being able to hear the great outdoors while sitting in the garden or park in brilliant sunshine is thoroughly enjoyable. Trying to listen to a podcast while travelling on London’s noisy Piccadilly line, not so much.

So the Frames will never be the only set of headphones you need, and they could do with a battery in the case, volume controls and a few more styles, not to mention prescription lenses and some killer Bose AR apps.

But even at £200 the Bose Frames are the most interesting piece of wearable technology I have donned since the original Google Glass.

54,Money,The best travel tech for a stress-free holiday,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/05/best-travel-tech-holiday-mobile-tablet-kindle-headphones,2019-07-05T10:17:29Z,"It’s July, the sun’s out and the summer break is almost upon us, which can mean only one thing: it’s holiday time.

But holidays no longer mean leaving all your worldly possessions behind. Your phone, your tablet, your e-reader, headphones and even your smartwatch come along for the ride, which means you need to keep them charged, organised and connected.

Here’s a gadget guide to help take the stress out of keeping your digital life up and running when travelling.

You don’t need to lug your bulky original charger with your phone, tablet or laptop. A range of great third-party chargers using new gallium nitride components are smaller and more powerful, able to take care of almost anything with USB. Here are some of the best.

The Anker Atom PD1 is arguably the smallest high-power charger available, even if the UK version is a bit bigger thanks to the awkward three-pin plug. With 30W charging via the USB-C PD port, the Atom PD1 can charge anything up to small laptops, including power-hungry iPad Pros and phones. It will charge an iPhone more than twice as fast as the stock power brick, but you will need a USB-C to Lightning cable.

If you need even more power for a larger laptop or are travelling further afield, then the Mu One International is the current king. It’s the thinnest 45W USB-C charger available and has a series of slide-on adapters for the UK, US or EU countries, including the brilliant folding British plug. It will charge just about any USB-C laptop including an Apple MacBook Pro or Dell XP13, plus anything smaller such as tablets and phones.

If you need to power up multiple things at once there are some excellent multi-device chargers available. Anker’s highly-rated PowerPort+ has four standard USB ports and one 29W USB-C port (£30) using a standard, detachable C7 (figure-eight) lead for power, which you can swap out for a EU or US plug. I’ve taken one all over the world and it works just as well today as it did three years ago.

More powerful alternatives include RavPower’s similar 5-port charger with 45W via the USB-C port (£25) or Aukey’s 60W USB-C with two other standard USB ports (£50).

What if a plug socket isn’t to hand? Portable battery packs are the answer. They come in all shapes, sizes, capacities and prices, charging your various devices on the move. Here are some of the best.

One of the largest capacity portable battery packs available is from Anker. At about 440g, the 26,800mAh Anker is a beast, but it can produce 30W from its USB-C port, which is enough to fast-charge small and medium laptops, tablets and anything in between.

Two standard USB ports can take care of anything else, while the large capacity battery has enough juice to charge most smartphones up to seven times, tablets at least twice or laptops once. It will fully charge via USB-C in about 4 hours with a 30W charger and just sneaks under the flight limit for rechargeable batteries, meaning you can safely take it on a plane.

If the Anker is too expensive, the RavPower USB-C Power Bank 26,800mAh PD Portable Charger is half price at £56 with the same 30W USB-C output, two standard USB ports and a microUSB port for charging. Anker’s slightly smaller PowerCore Speed 20100mAh Powerbank will also deliver 22.5W via USB-C for £50.

If you need a more powerful 45W of charging for a larger laptop, RavPower’s 20,100mAh power bank will do the trick with one USB-C port and one standard USB socket. It will fully charge in about 3.5 hours via USB-C at 30W, but it’s 100g heavier than the 30W powerbanks and more difficult to get in the UK than lower wattage banks.

Big capacity batteries are great, but are bulky. For those times when you need a bit of juice on the go, pocketable chargers such as Anker’s 86g PowerCore+ mini 3350 (£13) or 68g RavPower Power Bank Luster Mini 3350mAh (£11) will be enough to charge your phone to at least 60%, depending on the model.

Most will only output a paltry 1A (5W) out of their USB socket, which means slow charging, but they’re great in a pinch.

Traveling light isn’t easy if you have multiple devices with you on the road, but if you’re only charging one device at a time a multi-headed cable can cut the number of cables you need in three.

Anker’s 1m PowerLine II 3-in-1 (£12) and Spigen’s 1.5m Essential C10I3 (£12) both have a regular USB plug at one end and a microUSB plug at the other with add-on USB-C and Apple Lightning adapters, making them the one cable that can charge practically anything. The only downside is that you’ll need an adapter if you want to plug either cable into a USB-C charger such as the Anker Atom PD1 or Mu One.

Holidays in a car mean a GPS device is a must. But don’t rent a GPS from the hire car company; your phone loaded with offline Google Maps in a phone mount will be way better.

There are lots of excellent car mounts, but if you need one that sticks like glue to your windshield, then I heartily recommend the Montar from WinnerGear. It will stay stuck so hard to pretty much any flat surface that prising it off takes a bit of brute force, and has a good grip on your phone too.

Vent mounts are a good alternative to windscreen holders. Magnetic mounts have become popular, but you need to put a plate on the back of your phone. If you’re just looking for something simple for travel, the highly-rated Mpow Car Phone Holder Gravity Car Mount fits most phones in cases clipping onto air conditioning vents to hold your phone in place.

Travelling with a mass of cables, chargers and batteries can be a nightmare of tangles. Any old wallet or toiletry bag can help, but dedicated cable organisers tie the pesky things down either to a board or in a small bag, making them probably one of the best travel accessories I’ve ever bought.

If you want a small cable organiser to start, then Bagsmart’s highly-rated small Pomona Electronic Organiser has a good combination of elastic tidies, mesh pockets and even an SD card pouch.

Larger versions are available with multiple layers for even more cables. If you’re travelling with an iPad or other tablet too there even combo cases that will sort your cables and protect your electronics, starting at about £20.

A good set of noise cancelling headphones can relieve some of the stress of travelling by car, plane or train. Good options are available from about £80 and up, with the Bose QC35 II (£289) and the Sony MX1000M3 (£279) being the very best.

Noise-cancelling headphones use a series of microphones to detect unwanted sound, then play the inverse of that sound through the headphones’ speakers, timed so it reaches your eardrum at the same time. The two sound waves cancel each other out, neutralising the nasty noise such as the drone of engines or the roar of air and protecting your hearing while they’re at it.

55,Media,Ofcom wants laws to protect UK companies’ public service content,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/04/ofcom-wants-laws-protect-uk-public-service-content,2019-07-04T11:27:22Z,"The broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has called for new laws to ensure that shows made by UK broadcasters including the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 continue to get top billing on on-demand services such as Sky – but the rules will not apply to Netflix and Amazon.

The regulator has recommended that the government bring in legislation to guarantee that the content and streaming services of iPlayer, ITV Hub and All4 are not buried deep in the on-demand services of competitors such as Sky and Virgin Media or through smart TVs such as Samsung.

Traditionally, the UK’s public service broadcasters have been guaranteed top slots on TV guides, thanks to legislation introduced in 2003, but the laws do not extend to the on-demand world. The shift in viewing habits – from the arrival of Netflix and Amazon to the introduction of recommendation algorithms and “top picks” – has meant that viewers increasingly bypass the traditional electronic programme guide.

Ofcom said: “Public service broadcasting is now at a crucial juncture, as broadcasters face unprecedented competition from global on-demand and internet services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube.

“We are recommending to government that new rules are established to ensure that PSB [public service broadcasting] content is clearly visible on major viewing platforms, such as smart TVs, set-top boxes and streaming sticks.”

However, any legislation brought in by the government would not force Netflix and Amazon to give top billing to public service UK broadcasters’ shows, as they do not hold licences with Ofcom and therefore do not have to adhere to UK broadcasting regulation. There are now more than 17 million UK subscribers to Netflix and Amazon.

Ofcom acknowledged the “initial focus” was on the increasingly popular method of viewing through smart and connected TVs with the possibility that “other TV platforms and services may be subject to the prominence rules in the future, as technology and viewing habits change”.

The chiefs of the UK’s PSBs have accused commercial players of championing their own content, while making rival shows and players more difficult to find. They have also accused Netflix and Amazon of “buying prominence” by paying for highly-visible, branded buttons on the remote controls of some smart TV services to increase the chances viewers go to their services first.

If the government elects to implement new legislation it will be a fillip for public service broadcasters as their shows and players will be promoted ahead of those of Netflix and Amazon on services such as Sky Q.

Commercial players have claimed they do promote individual shows from PSBs fairly but said that being forced to do the same for their on-demand and streaming players is unfair. For example, the ITV Hub, which aggregates all of ITV’s content, would include shows such as Love Island, Coronation Street, X Factor and Family Guy, which are outside current PSB regulations.

“Highly regulated British platforms like Sky already give prominence to on demand content from public service broadcasters,” said Stephen van Rooyen, chief executive of Sky UK & Ireland. “The government should not seek to further regulate the regulated, but instead level the playing field with other platforms.”

Ofcom has said that in order to qualify to be promoted by the new laws, broadcasters’ on-demand services would need to deliver an “appropriate range” of high-quality PSB content which may include requirements around particular genres such as children’s shows, current affairs and factual content and programmes “made specifically for UK viewers”.

Kevin Bakhurst, the group director of content and media policy at Ofcom, said: “Our traditional broadcasters are among the finest in the world but they’re facing unprecedented challenges from competition and new technology.

“So we are ensuring their channels remain easy to find on TV guides, and convening a national debate on the future of public service media – including how we safeguard its benefits for future generations.”",0.9972,
56,Technology,Can I buy a phone that doesn’t use anything from Google or Apple?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/jul/04/can-i-buy-a-phone-that-does-not-use-anything-from-google-or-apple,2019-07-04T07:00:39Z,"Very easy. You can pick up a Nokia 105 (2017 edition) for about £15 or a dual-sim Nokia 106 (2018 edition) for about £16. These are only 2G phones but they have built-in FM radios, they can send texts, they are great for making phone calls and they are not based on Google or Apple technologies. A 3G or 4G phone would cost a bit more …

Of course, you may also want to do smartphone-type things such as email and web browsing. In that case, buy a GPD Pocket 2, GPD MicroPC, One Mix Yoga, One Mix 1S, One Mix 2S or similar just-about-pocketable computer running Microsoft Windows 10 on a 7in screen. (GeekBuying stocks several models and is taking reservations on the One Mix 1S.) Mini-laptops may look expensive but they are cheaper than high-end smartphones.

This answers your question but it is obviously not the solution you are looking for …

The problem is that most people – including me – want to use Googly things on their phones. Gmail is the dominant email service, YouTube is the dominant short video provider, Google Search and Google Maps are very useful and Google Chrome is the most widely used web browser. There may be viable and sometimes preferable alternatives but you have to make an effort to use them. Most people don’t want to make the effort.

Indeed, it looks as though the next generation of candy-bar phones will also include Google. Nokia’s latest 4G feature-phone, the Nokia 8110 “banana phone”, runs the KaiOS operating system, in which Google has invested $22 million. The Alcatel Go Flip 2, JioPhone and Orange Sanza are alternative KaiOS phones available in North America, India and Africa respectively. (Kai is named from the Chinese word for open, not the undead protagonist in the Lexx science fiction series.)

KaiOS includes WhatsApp – its main selling point – plus a web browser, Facebook, YouTube, Google Maps and Google Assistant. It’s claimed to be the second most popular operating system in India and could manage that in Africa. Some KaiOS phones cost less than $20.

KaiOS started as a fork of B2G (Boot to Gecko), which was an open source continuation of Firefox OS, which Mozilla stopped developing at the end of 2015. Gonk, the operating system underneath Gecko (which is Firefox’s web-rendering engine) is a small Linux kernel derived from Google’s AOSP, the Android Open Source Project.

In other words, the OS most likely to become a global alternative to Apple’s iOS and Google Android isn’t – and isn’t likely to be – 100% free from Google software. Even if it is not KaiOS, any future OS might use parts of AOSP because it is easier than developing everything from scratch. It could also pre-package access to some Google properties, even if they are just web apps, because most people want to use them.

The fact that we have, essentially, a duopoly in the smartphone business is not for want of trying. Microsoft entered the market with a version of Windows running on ARM-based smartphones and it even made Windows available free on small-screen devices. The people who owned Windows phones seemed to love them and in 24 countries it overtook Apple’s iPhone in market share. However, the lack of apps was a major stumbling block and Microsoft abandoned its challenge, having lost billions of dollars in the attempt.

You can still buy Windows phones but most date from 2015-16 and will soon be out of support. I didn’t recommend buying them when they came out so I really wouldn’t recommend one now.

Canonical also had a go at the smartphone market with its Linux-based Ubuntu Touch. It failed. In this case, the development was taken over by the UBports Community, which developed a port for the OnePlus One smartphone in 2015. There are now a few others but I don’t expect Ubuntu Touch phones to appear in your local high street.

South Korea’s two smartphone manufacturers, Samsung and LG, would also love to have an independent operating system but success is unlikely. Samsung tried with Tizen, which was supported by the Linux Foundation. The Samsung Z series was launched in India and didn’t do well enough but Tizen is used in Samsung Gear smartwatches. LG could have a go with Palm’s Linux-based webOS, which it acquired from HP in 2013. WebOS first appeared on Palm Pre smartphones in 2009 but LG has mainly used it in smart TV sets.

Sailfish started with another failed Linux project, Nokia and Intel’s MeeGo. The latest version uses a graphical shell from Jolla, the Finnish company that appears to be its major backer. Sailfish can be ported to more alternative smartphones than Ubuntu Touch but I can’t see any current phones with Sailfish pre-installed. The same is true for both /e/ (formerly Eelo), which is a sort of de-Googled Android, and LineageOS, which is a reborn CyanogenMod.

You main hope is Purism’s forthcoming Librem 5, which seems to be exactly what you want. Whether it can buck the trend remains to be seen.

In general, the problem with Linux on smartphones looks much like its problem on PCs. Many and various groups enjoy developing new versions of the operating system, which are all more or less doomed from birth. None of them have the skills, the interests or the money to create viable platforms that include the hardware, apps, services, packaging, marketing, advertising, distribution and support on the sort of scale needed to sustain a real product. Without those, they are unlikely to attract much interest beyond hobbyists and enthusiasts.

Things may change thanks mainly to the current American president. Trump sent China and the rest of the world a wakeup call by trying to exclude Huawei – the world’s second-largest smartphone manufacturer and the leader in 5G – from using American technology. Huawei was already developing its own Android app-compatible operating system, currently known as Hongmen OS, as an alternative. The potential loss of up to $30bn in sales per year suggests there will be no shortage of money or manpower for its future development.

Indeed, China has a powerful incentive to replace all the American technology it uses with home-grown alternatives. This may take decades but in the long run, it will hurt Google, Intel, Qualcomm and numerous other US companies. The genie is out of the bottle and the Americans will never be able to put it back.

Hongmen, aka Ark OS, may not have a lot of appeal in Europe but it could do well in Asian countries that already do more trade with China than with the US.

Meanwhile, the EU’s latest antitrust case against Google should allow phone manufacturers to offer alternative browsers and search engines. It should also enable Android smartphone suppliers to sell phones with alternative versions of Android in Europe, which Google did not allow them to do before. A major player such as Samsung or Huawei could therefore test the market with a Google-free Android phone. In which case, you can vote with your wallet.

Whatever happens with Apple and Google, people buy smartphones to run apps and most apps appear to be compromising your privacy. In 2017 a study from the University of California at Berkeley found that around 70% of apps shared your data with third-party services (PDF).

A recent Washington Post story based on Disconnect.me technology found trackers were rife in the journalist’s iPhone apps. Google, of course, banned Disconnect Mobile from its Play store way back in 2014. In a blogpost, the company wrote: “Google refuses to explain their decision, other than to say that our app won’t be allowed if it interferes with any ads; even ads that contain malware and steal your identity.”

The app economy, like the web economy, is ultimately based on surveillance. That isn’t likely to change unless the EU does something about it. And so far, despite the GDPR and three antitrust cases against Google, the EU has left smartphone tracking revenues unharmed.

57,Technology,iOS 13: how to install Apple’s latest iPhone software today,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/25/ios-13-install-apple-latest-iphone-software-beta-today,2019-06-25T09:17:07Z,"Apple has released the public beta version of its much-anticipated free iOS 13 software update for iPhones and the first edition of its new iPadOS for tablets.

Those eager to try the latest features, including the new dark mode, faster Face ID, Memoji stickers and smarter photo organisation, can now install iOS 13 on a compatible iPhone or iPadOS on their Apple tablet.

Announced at the beginning of June, iOS 13 and iPadOS were initially released as a developer test versions but are now available for the general public to try before their full release in September.

To try out iOS 13 you will need an iPhone 6S, iPhone SE, iPod touch (seventh generation) or newer device. For iPadOS you will need an iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4, iPad Pro or newer device.

1. Make a full backup of your phone or tablet as, if you dislike the update, reverting back to iOS 12 will require a full wipe and restore of the device.

2. Visit Apple’s beta site on your iPhone or iPad and sign in with your Apple ID (the one you use for iTunes and the App Store).

4. Open the Settings app, tap on the new Profile menu option near the top and install the Profile using your pin code.

7. Check for updates in the settings app under General > Software Update.

8. Download and install the iOS 13 or iPadOS Public beta (this may take some time).

Once installed on your phone or tablet iOS 13 and iPadOS will automatically update as new beta versions are released (there were 10 for the public beta of iOS 12). As ever, it is important to make sure you install updates promptly, as bugs are fixed on a regular basis and older versions will no longer be supported.

It is also worth noting that this is very much still an early test version of Apple’s software and bugs will be present that can cause crashes and other issues. Battery life and device performance may not be the same either.

Some experienced developers have been warning about the testing nature of iOS 13 and iPadOS.

The advice is to install it on an older phone or tablet, if you have one, or wait until the next beta update, which is likely to be more stable and complete. But for those eager to try the very latest iPhone or iPad software, this is your chance.

58,Technology,Apple recalls 15in MacBook Pro laptops over battery fire risk,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/21/apple-recalls-15-inch-macbook-pro-laptops-battery-fire-risk,2019-06-21T10:19:52Z,"Apple is recalling some of its 15in MacBook Pro laptops over a battery fire risk.

The company said on Thursday that a limited number of its largest laptop line, sold between September 2015 and February 2017, contained batteries that “may overheat and pose a safety risk”.

Apple asked customers with MacBook Pro (Retina, 15in, Mid 2015) laptops to stop using the machines immediately and to seek to have the battery replaced as soon as possible, which would be done free as part of the recall. It said the service may take one to two weeks.

The company said anyone with the model, which cost upwards of £1,599, should cross-check the serial number of the machine on the Apple recall site. The serial number could be found by clicking on the Apple menu in the top left corner of the screen and choosing “About this Mac”.

““Customer safety is always Apple’s top priority, and we have voluntarily decided to replace affected batteries, free of charge,” Apple said in a statement.

The battery issues did not affect other 15in MacBook Pro laptops or other Mac products, it said.

Battery safety issues have been taken more seriously across the technology industry since the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone was recalled twice before being permanently discontinued after a series of battery fires.

Despite being dwarfed by iPhone sales, Apple’s Mac line of laptop and desktop computers remain a key part of the business. In its most recent quarterly financial results, Macs brought in $5.5bn (£4.2bn) in revenue.

The third-generation retina MacBook Pro is the immediate predecessor to the current fourth-generation MacBook Pro line, which dropped traditional connectivity ports for the modern USB-C standard and the Touch Bar in 2016.

In April, Apple recalled of some of its plug adapters after discovering they could break and cause electric shocks when touched.",0.7722,
59,Technology,Where’s the cheapest place to store 500GB of data online?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/jun/20/wheres-the-cheapest-place-to-store-500gb-of-data-online,2019-06-20T08:26:36Z,"Most of us just evolve the way we do things by making convenient short-term decisions. A price jolt should prompt you to rethink how you are storing your data, where you are storing it, and why. Different people have different devices and different needs, so I can’t pick the best strategy for you or anybody else. However, I can give you a few things the think about.

The core question, of course, is why you need to store 500GB of stuff online in the first place. You could buy a 4TB external hard drive for less than £90.

The first and best reason is that you often need access to the same data from multiple devices, some of which you use while away from home. The second – very sensible – reason might be that you want an off-site backup where your data will be safe if you’re burgled, your house burns down, or there is some other catastrophe.

A third reason might be that you are sharing your photos and (less likely) data with friends and family, or possibly with the public. Millions of people shared their photos on Flickr, and billions share reduced-quality versions on social networking services such as Facebook and Instagram.

A fourth reason might be that you have no way to keep a local backup. If so, you are in trouble. Online storage services are like lobster pots: it’s easy to get into them but hard to get out.

In a better world, you would be able to move 500GB of data from one service to any other in a few seconds, without downloading it and re-uploading it. Sadly, that’s not the case today. And if your data only exists in one online storage pot, then you have no backup and your data is at risk. People lose data every day because they forget and can’t recover passwords, their accounts are hacked, or their service provider has a hardware malfunction or makes a mistake.

Some people lose data when services change their terms, like Flickr, or go bust, like Streamload. Some people lost data when Megaupload’s servers were seized by the FBI. Some could lose data when The Big One hits California. Having only one copy of their data in one online pot is a gamble that many people will lose.

You should have local copies and backups of everything, so that you can walk away and just let Dropbox close your account. If you are not in that position, keep paying Dropbox until you are.

Dropbox has increased its starting price to £95.88 a year, which is £7.99 a month if paid annually. However, it also doubled the storage allowance to 2TB, which used to cost about $200 (£158) a year, and it has added some extra features. It’s still competitive with other leading services that usually don’t store 30 days of revisions or let you easily undo a file deletion.

Google One, as it’s now called, charges £7.99 a month for 2TB, which drops to an annual fee of £79.99 a year. At that price, I’d stay with Dropbox. It’s better.

Amazon Drive costs £79.99 a year for 1TB and £159.98 a year for 2TB. Apple’s iCloud is relatively cheap at £6.99 a month for 2TB. Microsoft OneDrive only goes up to 50GB for storage, at £1.99 a month, but you get 1TB with Office 365 Personal for £5.99 a month or £59.99 a year.

Less familiar suppliers are sometimes but not always cheaper. Kim Dotcom’s New Zealand-based Mega charges £8.91 a month for 1TB. Canada’s Sync charges $49 a year for 500GB and $96 a year for 2TB. America’s IDrive charges $69.50 for 2TB. The UK’s Zoolz charges £5.49 a month (paid annually) for 500GB or £9.99 a month for a 1TB Family Plus plan, intended to back up 15 computers for up to five users. Like some other online services, Zoolz seems more oriented towards backing up PCs.

At the moment, your best bet appears to be Switzerland-based pCloud, which offers 500GB for £3.59 a month or £42.99 a year, and 2TB for £7.99 a month or £84.99 a year. Better still, pCloud is currently offering a lifetime 500GB for a single payment of £160 (usually £430) or 2TB for £320 (usually £850). I’ve not used the service, but you could try its free 10GB offering and see if it suits you.

Think about splitting your photo storage and your data storage. If you are like me, you have large image files – each jpeg from my Nikon D7500 takes up about 12MB – and relatively small text files. My Work folder holds more than 10,000 files but still consumes less than 3GB. I could zip it, password protect it and store it in any of the free online drives, except Dropbox.

Flickr used to be a great place to store 1TB of images for free, but late last year, Verizon sold it to Smugmug. Smugmug charges $5.99 a month or $48 a year for unlimited photo storage. That’s not a bad deal for a service that works really well with photographs.

Both Amazon and Google also offer unlimited photo storage, with slight catches.

Amazon Photos is free with an Amazon Prime account, and part of its appeal is that it will accept and display RAW files, not just jpegs. And while it can analyse and tag your photos for search purposes, that’s optional.

Google Photos, born out of the wreck that was Google Plus, offers unlimited storage as long as your photos are less than 16MP. This makes it useless for most serious photographers, at least as a backup service. Google also uses machine learning to analyse your photos so that you can search for people, places and things. Search is a useful feature, but photos give away vast amounts of personal information.

If you use an Android phone, your snaps are stored in Google Photos, and you can choose to clear local copies from your phone to save space and pull them down from the cloud on demand – internet connection required. Amazon Photos can do something similar.

Test any photo storage site before you commit to using it. Upload a couple of photos and then download them to make sure they still have the same dimensions in pixels, that the files are the same size, and that they have the same names. This rules out Facebook, Instagram, Imgur and many other services.

SD cards might be an alternative

Online storage sites are really handy for storing smartphone pictures until you can download and archive them, and for sharing photos with other people. However, SD cards are getting so much bigger and cheaper that they’re an increasingly attractive alternative.

I’ve been buying Samsung EVO Plus micro-SD cards on Amazon, and the current prices are £21.75 for 128GB, £47 for 256GB and £94.88 for 512GB. I’ve also bought a few SanDisk Ultra cards, which can be a little more expensive, but pop up on special deals. One week last month, for example, you could buy 128GB SanDisk Ultra cards for £14.99, and in April, 256GB cards dropped to £37.99.

All my photos are on three hard drives (each PC is backed up to a 2TB or 3TB drive, and the backups are backed up to an 8TB drive), but SD cards make it easy to create an off-site backup.

Also, if you have a laptop with a card slot, you can hide as much data as you’re likely to need while travelling somewhere about your person. Micro-SD cards are tiny. The obvious drawback is that, unless you encrypt the data, they are not secure if you lose them.

60,Technology,‘I feel like a target’: US tech workers of Chinese descent see trade war backlash,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/18/i-feel-like-a-target-us-trade-war-worries-tech-workers-of-chinese-descent,2019-06-19T05:00:14Z,"Technology workers of Chinese descent say that they are experiencing backlash due to the US-China trade war and fears over Huawei, according to a survey commissioned by the Guardian through Blind, an app allowing anonymous workplace communication.

“With the trade war against China and especially the Huawei case I feel like a target more and more every day,” an anonymous Amazon employee wrote in a comment on the app, which is popular among technology employees and verifies employment through work emails. “I can’t even feel comfortable about being Chinese because so many Americans see China as a threat now.”

The Guardian asked Blind to commission the survey after the Trump administration escalated tensions in the growing trade dispute by declaring a national economic emergency and placing Huawei on a government blacklist.

The move had immediate consequences for Silicon Valley companies that do business with Huawei, which is the second-largest smartphone maker in the world after Samsung and ahead of Apple. Google blocked Huawei’s access to updates of the Android operating system and other US chipmakers cut off supplies to the company.

More than 6,000 Blind users responded to the question, “Do you predict that there will be negative consequences for people who are connected to China/perceived to be Chinese due to the growing tensions of the US-China trade war and concerns over Huawei?” Respondents were also asked if they were Chinese citizens, Chinese Americans, or of other East Asian ethnicities. The survey is not a scientific poll, but it does provide some insight into sentiments among tech workers who use the app to discuss workplace issues with anonymity.

Nearly two-thirds of respondents working for hardware or semiconductor firms responded “Yes” or “It’s already happening”. Employees of the chipmaker Qualcomm were the most concerned, with 20% saying individuals of Chinese descent were already facing negative consequences, and 56% predicting problems. Employees of Nvidia and Apple also had especially high rates of concern, followed by Google, Intel and Uber.

Slightly less than half (48.4%) of respondents working for software and internet companies either predicted problems or said they were already happening. Across all industries, Chinese nationals had the highest rates of concern (66.7%), while Chinese Americans and those of other East Asian ethnicities (approximately 48%) were slightly more concerned than those who said they were not Chinese or East Asian (43%).

“Asian Americans have always been haunted by the specter of dual loyalty, and it’s not just in our heads,” said Frank Wu, a University of California Hastings law professor and the author of Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White. “The best example is the internment of Japanese Americans in world war II. Two-thirds of those interned were native born … Every time there is tension between any Asian country and America, Asian Americans face problems, even if they’re not of that particular ethnicity.”

The Trump administration’s action against Huawei came amid increasingly bellicose rhetoric against China by US politicians and foreign policy figures. In November, the Hoover Institution released a report urging “constructive vigilance” against Chinese efforts to influence American society. The report’s authors warned against subjecting Chinese Americans to “the kind of generalized suspicion or stigmatization that could lead to racial profiling or a new era of McCarthyism”, but also argued that “the Chinese American community” was a target of influence efforts. The report has garnered criticism from dissenting experts who say it will lead to racial profiling.

In April, a group of former government officials and foreign policy figures revived the coldwar-era Committee on the Present Danger as a new organization with a focus on opposing China. At a launch event for the group, Steve Bannon, the former Trump adviser and far-right figurehead, railed against Huawei, saying: “Huawei is the People’s Liberation Army … 5G turns data into plutonium that can be weaponized and they intend to weaponize.”

Andy Li, a Chinese American college student and member of the Silicon Valley Chinese Association, said that he had noticed increased hostility toward Chinese students on campus, and that the climate was also raising concerns about job prospects for Asian Americans.

“There’s also this newer fear that for Asian Americans, and especially Chinese Americans, it’s going to be harder to get jobs, especially in tech, cybersecurity, and scientific research,” he said. “There’s this fear that even after you’ve assimilated and become a citizen, it doesn’t matter. You’re a national security threat.”

Other individuals who spoke to the Guardian were less concerned about increased hostilities. Patrick Ma, a software engineer with an American-born mother and Hong Kong-born father, said that he was happy to be a “global citizen” and that he hadn’t experienced any discrimination. “The Chinese have so much to be grateful for to Trump,” he said, because actions like the Huawei blacklist would force the company to launch its own operating system and improve China’s economy.

Juliet Shen, a Chinese American product manager at Snap, said that she did have concerns about racial profiling, but not for herself.

“My concerns are more for my parents, who are scientists, and there’s similar allegations of espionage, suspicion [and] discrimination towards Chinese scientists right now too,” she said. “It’s always been a little bit of a concern but definitely has ramped up in recent months [and] years. The Chinese academic and science community has been very panicked and afraid.”",-0.9934,
61,Technology,Samsung Galaxy S10e review: the cheaper one,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/18/samsung-galaxy-s10e-review-the-cheaper-one,2019-06-18T06:00:51Z,"Smallest, cheapest Samsung flagship has most of what makes the S10 line good, but with a flat screen and one camera fewer

The Galaxy S10e is Samsung’s attempt to offer a flagship smartphone experience in a smaller body and at a lower cost, which mostly works.

The formula is simple: take the same processor, reduce the memory a little and squeeze it into a smaller, less complicated body.

The AMOLED screen is only 5.8in on the diagonal, only FHD+ and only flat, not curved at the edges. Whether any of those are downsides depends on your view of curved screens. The display isn’t visibly worse than the S10, and it still has the hole-punch notch through which the selfie camera pokes.

The display is covered in last year’s Corning Gorilla Glass 5, not 6 as fitted to the regular S10, so it might be a little less scratch resistant or prone to smashing on impact.

With rounded metal sides and glass front and back, it looks fairly simple in design terms. Get it in prism white or canary yellow and it’ll stand out from the crowd. The S10e is easy to hold onto at only 69.9mm wide and 142.2mm tall, which makes it one of the smallest flagship phones on the market alongside Google’s Pixel 3.

In reality it doesn’t feel all that smaller than the S10 because it’s only 0.5mm narrower and 7g lighter.

There’s the lesser-spotted headphone socket in the bottom, next to the USB-C port, and the phone is water resistant to IP68 standards: 1.5m depths of up to 30 minutes.

The Galaxy S10e has the same processor – the Samsung Exynos 9820 in the EU or the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 in the US – as the larger, more expensive Galaxy S10 and S10+.

The cheaper phone has only 6GB of memory compared with 8GB, but most will likely not notice, as performance was pretty much the same. Only on occasion would an app have to reload when brought back from the recently used apps list.

That means the S10e is as fast and fluid as most of the competition, even if it doesn’t quite manage OnePlus 7 Pro-levels of speed.

Battery life on the S10e was a disappointing 25 hours between charges, the same as the regular S10. With the always-on display (AOD) setting off, the phone would last from 7am on day one until 9am on day two, which might be enough to get you into work.

That was while browsing and using apps for five hours with plenty of push messages and emails, watching 60 minutes of offline video, shooting about five photos a day and listening to about five hours of Spotify using Bluetooth headphones.

You will likely have to charge it before a night out so it’ll get you home the other side. Charging is pretty slow too, taking 95 minutes to fully charge via cable and similar via 15W wireless charging. Wireless powershare works well, but is fairly slow – fine for charging a set of headphones.

The Galaxy S10e runs the same new One UI version of Android 9 Pie as the rest of the S10 line, and is a big improvement on previous versions of Samsung’s customised Android experience.

Most of the changes have been made to make using a large phone easier, but given the smaller size of the S10e, they’re less of an improvement. Still, everything looks good and works well. The only area where Samsung is clearly behind the curve is the gesture navigation. Its swipe pads work fine but are harder to reach and less fluid than the competition. I ended up sticking to the traditional navigation buttons.

You’ll get about three years of software support from Samsung, but Android version updates will be slower than some of the competition, meaning Android Q will likely only arrive in excess of six months after its release.

Unlike the rest of the S10 line the Galaxy S10e has a traditional capacitive fingerprint scanner built into the power button. It’s fast, accurate and lines up with roughly where your right thumb rests on the side of the phone where you would normally push the power button.

But it’s harder to use in your left hand. I found that it was placed too high up on the right side to comfortably hit it with my left index finger in a natural position taking several attempts to unlock the phone.

If you’re left handed and want to use a fingerprint scanner, think twice about the S10e.

One of the areas where the S10e is inferior to its more expensive siblings is in the camera. There is only two cameras on the back, not three. Still, the main 12-megapixel camera is joined by the 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle camera, leaving zoom to pure digital, which is noticeably worse than the S10 or S10+.

That means the S10e is capable of capturing some really good standard and wide-angle shots, with good detail and colour range. It certainly isn’t the best camera on the market, but it keeps up with most of the competition short of the zoom.

The selfie camera is excellent; so is video capture. And there are plenty of modes, including manual “Pro” mode and a dedicated Instagram camera, to play with.
• None The S10e is really nice to just fiddle with in the hand, more so than the larger S10
• None The phone comes with a screen protector pre-installed
• None There’s a Bixby key on the left side which can safely be ignored

The Samsung Galaxy S10e costs £669 in white, black, green or yellow.

For comparison, the 6.1in Galaxy S10 costs £799, the 6.4in Galaxy S10+ costs £899, the 5.5in Google Pixel 3 costs £739, the 6.1in Apple iPhone XR costs £749 and the OnePlus 7 costs £499.

With the Galaxy S10e Samsung has mostly managed to condense what is good about its 2019 flagship S10 line into something smaller and cheaper.

It’s full of good, but not quite the best features. The screen is great, the camera is good but has no optical zoom, the fingerprint scanner is fast but awkward for left-handers and while performance is great, battery life is a bit weak.

The S10e’s £669 RRP isn’t that cheap either, when companies such as OnePlus offer better specifications in similarly built phones for £169 less. With the regular S10 already available for similar money, but with a better camera and in-display fingerprint, the S10e becomes less palatable.

But the Galaxy S10e is a good phone, which will be even better when bought on a deal. If you hate curved screens but want a top-end Samsung, then this is the phone for you.

63,Money,Buying cables? Going for gold could mean a rip-off,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/08/buying-cables-going-for-gold-could-mean-a-rip-off,2019-06-08T07:30:06Z,"Cables are a necessary evil in our modern world. Whether it’s the power cord for your phone, the cables jammed in the back of your TV or the wires connecting you to the internet, they’re everywhere.

And when you need a new one the options are almost limitless, with some costing as much as hundreds of pounds. But do you need to spend all that for a cable? Absolutely not. So here’s a quick guide to cables to help you avoid the overpriced.

You don’t need gold plated HDMI or optical cables

Gold connectors and high-quality copper used to make a big difference in the analogue world, but here in the digital 21 century it’s like lipstick on a pig.

Shiny gold connectors might look nice, but they make no difference. Digital is binary - it either works or it doesn’t. You won’t get a better picture from a gold cable.

As much use as a Ferrari in a snowstorm, fancy Kevlar or nylon braided cables add nothing unless you’re working them hard. Most cables spend their life plugged in and left alone, but those taken on the road – here’s looking at you, phone cable – might last a bit longer with some strengthening.

The materials don’t really matter for digital cables, but their specifications do. Most are mercifully straightforward.

HDMI – most commonly used to connect things to your TV – comes in various versions including 1.4, 2.0 and 2.1, which are backwards compatible, for example a 2.1 cable will work with anything earlier. Version 2.0 has been the main standard since 2013, meaning most HDMI cables sold over the last five or so years work with 2.0a/b.

In January 2017 HDMI 2.1 was released to support higher than 4K content, but very few devices actually use it and most existing cables already support the majority of the new features. Only if you’re trying to watch 4K at 120Hz (60Hz is standard) or 8K video do you need new “ultra high speed” HDMI 2.1 cables – an unlikely event for most consumers.

There are also HDMI cables that support ethernet connectivity, which are backwards compatible but as barely anything in the home actually uses the ethernet bit don’t spend extra on them.

Speaking of ethernet, not all ethernet cables are born equal. While all the connectors are the same RJ45 jack, you commonly find cat5/5e or cat6 cables. The “cat” number indicates the quality of the materials and insulation within the cable, which affects its maximum transmission speed.

The cheaper cat5 can support speeds up to 1Gbps where cat6 supports up to 10Gbps - for reference the average UK broadband speed is just 55Mbps or 0.055Gbps. The actual speed you get is entirely dependent on what you’re connecting – a slow internet connection is not going to be made faster by a high spec cable – so unless you know you need to transfer data over 1Gbps don’t spend the extra on cat6 cables. You want “patch” cables if you’re connecting a computer or similar to a router. If you’re laying ethernet cable into walls or under the floor buy the best you can so you don’t have to rip it all up again in the future.

Cat5 ethernet cables cost as little as £1, while cat6 ethernet cables cost go from £4.

You don’t need your original phone cables to charge

Charging cables for phones are probably the most lost or broken cables around. The good news is that most phones support a variety of cables: you don’t need to use the one that came with it.

Apple’s iPhone uses the proprietary Lighting cable, but you don’t have to buy Apple’s £19 cable each time you break or lose it. Quality certified Lightning cables cost just £5 from Amazon. But if you want to charge your iPhone faster, you’ll need a Lightning to USB-C cable, which Apple charges £19 for 1m or £35 for 2m – but yours for just £12 on Amazon.

For Android phones you have a choice of the old microUSB or the new USB-C. Both cables are universal and available from a variety of third-party manufacturers, with quality versions costing as little as £6.

Some smartphones have proprietary fast charging standards, including OnePlus and Huawei, which need special cables to go with special chargers to hit their max charging speeds. But they will still fast charge with standard USB-C cables and third-party chargers.

Nor do you need your original phone charger

Just like cables, you don’t need to use the charger that came with your phone. There are many third-party chargers that can not only charge your phone faster but also have multiple ports for powering up more than one device at a time.

There are multiple charging standards, including Qualcomm’s Quick Charge, the standard USB-PD (Power Delivery) and special fast-charging tech such as OnePlus Warp Charge or Huawei SuperCharge. The good news is that most of them are cross compatible with USB-C chargers that use USB-PD, meaning you can fast charge almost any modern smartphone, tablet or laptop with a USB-C charger.

Apple, for instance, still ships its £999 iPhones with weak 5W USB chargers. With a USB-PD supporting 18W or greater and a USB-C to Lighting cable you can fast charge the iPhone 8 or later to 50% in 30 minutes.

Similarly, Samsung’s Galaxy S smartphones support Qualcomm QuickCharge 2, but can fast charge on any USB-PD power adapter.

USB-C chargers come in various shapes and sizes rated by wattage. 18W or higher will fast charge most phones, while 30W or higher will handle tablets and smaller laptops. Some laptops need 45W or higher, with high performance machines needing above 80W.

Quality USB-C chargers start at under £20. Look out for Anker, Aukey and RavPower brands at the cheaper end or Apple’s high-powered laptop chargers at the top end.

Ditch the cable and go wireless

It’s 2019 - you probably don’t need a cable at all to charge your top-end phone. Wireless charging is becoming a standard among phones. The good news is that most devices, including Apple, Samsung, Huawei and many others, use the Qi wireless charging standard meaning any Qi-compatible pad should work with a wireless charging phone, headphones or other devices.

Like cable power adapters, wireless charging is rated in watts, with 5W the default which is fairly slow, but fine for overnight charging. Faster wireless chargers are available including 10W and 15W. The iPhone will wirelessly charge at a maximum of 7.5W, but Huawei, Samsung and other manufacturers support up to 15W charging. Some phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S10 and the Huawei P30 Pro can even wirelessly charge other devices too.

The brave new world of USB-C isn’t just about charging. Laptops, tablets and even some phones can now use USB-C to connect all sorts of things, from displays to flash drives.

If you need regular USB ports, dongles are the way forward costing from £6. But you can also get USB-C cables to replace most traditional cables. That includes USB-C to HDMI, DisplayPort, analogue audio sockets and many others.

Check for prices as some are more cost effective than buying adapters for your existing cables.

Some cables that come with laptops, headphones and other devices look proprietary but aren’t, meaning you don’t have to buy them from the original manufacturer.

The classic example is the 2.5mm headphone jack, which is slightly smaller than the standard 3.5mm headphone jack people are used to. Bose and several other headphone manufacturers use this jack to plug into their phones via cable, but it’s a standard cable like any other and can be bought for a fraction of the cost when the original breaks.

Others include the round power adapter, which was commonly used on laptops and other equipment. It is just a standard DC plug that comes in a variety of different sizes. As long as you match the voltage and amperage, compatible chargers with multiple plugs can often be cheaper and more useful if your original breaks.",0.9986,
64,Technology,Samsung Galaxy S10 review: the sweet spot,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/06/samsung-galaxy-s10-review-the-sweet-spot,2019-06-06T06:09:24Z,"The Galaxy S10 is Samsung’s middle-of-the-road top-end phone, featuring a large screen in a pretty compact body for those who don’t like the current breed of massive flagship superphones.

The regular, non-plus versions of Samsung’s Galaxy S line have always been the sweet spot between size, price and performance. They offer big, beautiful screens in bodies that are practically tiny by today’s giant-phone standards.

The Galaxy S10 isn’t all that small, of course, measuring 70.4mm wide and 149.9mm tall with a stunning 6.1in QHD+ AMOLED screen. It’s about the same size as Apple’s iPhone XS, and considerably smaller than the Galaxy S10+, Huawei P30 Pro and OnePlus 7 Pro. It’s also one of the lightest top-end smartphones on the market at just 157g: 18g lighter than the S10+ and a full 49g lighter than the OnePlus 7 Pro.

Its size and weight make it one of easiest top-end phones to handle and pocket. Not once did the Galaxy S10 feel liable to being dropped, even when using it one-handed in packed trains.

The design of the Galaxy S10 is attractive, particularly in its pearlescent white, but doesn’t rock the boat. The front is glass; so is the back. They both curve at the edges to a thin polished metal band. The screen has a small circular cutout through which the selfie camera pokes.

The display also hides Samsung’s ultrasonic fingerprint scanner for unlocking the phone with your thumb on the screen. Arguably the most unusual aspect of the Galaxy S10 is the existence of a headphone socket in the bottom – a rare sight for a top-end smartphone in 2019.

The phone is water resistant to IP68 standards, or depths of up to 1.5 metres in fresh water for 30 minutes. Drop the S10 in the loo and you’ll be able to rinse it afterwards.

The Galaxy S10 has the same processor, memory and storage as the larger Galaxy S10+ and therefore performs similarly. In this US this means Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 processor, but outside in the UK, Europe and many other regions it means Samsung’s own Exynos 9820, as tested here.

Generally the S10 is as snappy as most of the competition, with no noticeable lag. It won’t match the very fastest phones, such as the OnePlus 7 Pro, but it keeps up with the competition and is a big leap over the two-year-old Galaxy S8.

Battery life on the S10 was a disappointing 25 hours between charges. With the screen set to FHD+ and the always-on display (AOD) setting off, the phone would last from 7am on day one until 8am on day two, dying on the train into work. That was while browsing and using apps for five hours with plenty of push messages and emails, watching 60 minutes of offline video, shooting about five photos a day and listening to about five hours of Spotify using Bluetooth headphones.

Cabled charging was fairly slow for the Galaxy S10 too, hitting 77% in an hour, but taking one hour 38 minutes to reach 100% – Huawei’s P30 Pro is fully charged in less than an hour. Wireless charging at up to 15W with a Qi charging matt works well, as does wireless power sharing, turning the phone into an ad-hoc wireless charger for something else.

The Galaxy S10 runs Samsung’s new One UI version of Android 9 Pie.

One UI is a big upgrade over previous versions of Samsung’s software, refocused around making phones with large screens more usable. While more beneficial for the larger Galaxy S10+, the S10 still benefits from generally having the top half of the phone for viewing information and the bottom half for touch-based interactions.

That puts menus, buttons and other touch-interaction points in easier reach of your thumb. Others are doing similar with Android, including Google, but Samsung is the most successful to date – something Apple and its back button in the top left of the screen should take note of.

One weak point compared with competitors is Samsung’s gesture navigation system, which simply replaces the standard back, home and overview buttons with swipe pads that do the same thing in the same place on the screen. It’s less ergonomic and fluid than rival systems such as that used by OnePlus, Huawei or even Google’s upcoming Android Q.

Samsung’s Bixby voice assistant is serviceable, but not as good as Google Assistant, often failing to understand what is said, so is safe to just avoid.

The fingerprint reader is embedded under the screen, using ultrasound to read your ridges through the display. Most other in-display fingerprint readers are optical, which is less secure than ultrasonic sensors, but both can still be fooled like most biometric systems with the right equipment.

Overall, the fingerprint scanner is more convenient built right into the screen, but isn’t as fast as traditional capacitive sensors or the fastest of new optical sensors such as that fitted to the OnePlus 7 Pro.

The Galaxy S10’s triple rear camera is one of the better systems on the market and is the same as that fitted to the larger Galaxy S10+. It’s main 12-megapixel camera, 12-megapixel telephoto camera and a 16-megapixel ultrawide-angle camera work together for easy and flexible shooting modes zooming from 0.5 to 2x, and on to a 10x hybrid zoom.

In good light the camera produces some really good photos, with great detail, colour and fast autofocus. In low light the S10 is solid but far behind the very best on the market, even with Samsung’s dedicated night mode.

The ultrawide-angle camera is a lot of fun, as is the live focus mode, which records depth information so you can blur the background in portraits or perform colour isolation. You can also post shots straight to Instagram using a dedicated camera mode, while video capture is also excellent.

Overall, the rear camera on the S10 matches rivals from Apple, but falls short of the best from Huawei. The S10 also has an excellent single selfie camera poking through the screen.
• None The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is incompatible with most screen protectors, but a compatible one is included in the box
• None The haptic vibrations are sharper than last year’s model, but not as good as Apple’s excellent Taptic Engine in the iPhone
• None Due to the smaller size I didn’t record any mis-touches of my palm on the screen, which is a common problem for curved-screen devices

The Samsung Galaxy S10 costs £799 with 128GB or £999 with 512GB of storage in white, black, blue or green glass.

For comparison, the 6.4in Galaxy S10+ costs £899, the 5.8in Galaxy S10e costs £669, the 6in Google Pixel 3a XL costs £469, the 5.5in Google Pixel 3 costs £739 and the 5.8in Apple iPhone XS costs £999.

The Samsung Galaxy S10 is an all-round great phone that thankfully keeps things at a manageable size. It still has a big, beautiful screen that’s great for watching videos, but it doesn’t make your hand hurt holding it.

Performance is good, the camera’s good and the software is the start of a rethink of how we use big phones. The ultrasonic fingerprint scanner works well enough too and there’s even a headphone socket.

My only real complaint is battery life is only just acceptable. You will have to charge the Galaxy S10 before a night out to make sure it will get you home, or at least activate some of the power saving modes.

If you’re looking for a great phone that’s on the smaller side of the gigantic-phone revolution, there aren’t many better than the Galaxy S10.

5G has been launched in the UK this week. I love the idea of higher connection speeds and I live in one of the areas where the new network operates. It is not cheap, however. So should I sign up now and buy a 5G phone or should I wait until there are more options on the market?

66,Television & radio,Charlie Brooker: 'Happy? I have my moments',https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/01/charlie-brooker-interview-annabel-jones-black-mirror,2019-06-01T05:00:54Z,"During the recent school holidays, Charlie Brooker made a deal with his seven-year-old son. “I said, ‘Right, you’ve got these tests coming up’ (these stupid SAT things),” he tells me. “I had a book of mock exams and I said, ‘If you do one of these every morning, half an hour, maths or English, then you can do whatever the fuck you want the rest of the day.’” Actually he didn’t swear, Brooker adds.

And what did Brooker Jr want to do for the rest of the day? Play video games. He likes the ones where you create levels and customise characters, like Super Mario Maker. “If anything, he’s more into computer games than I am, which is a statement I didn’t think it was possible to utter,” his dad, 48, tells me, not unproudly.

It was a good deal, that worked for both of them. “I assuaged parental guilt by making him sit an exam, he got to play computer games all day long, so it meant I could also do what the fuck I wanted.”

Brooker’s other child, five, is – disappointingly – less into gaming. Less into Dad too (“I don’t want you, I want Mummy,” he shouts when he hurts himself) but that’s by-the-by and possibly not for ever. “He wants to watch little bastards opening presents on YouTube, that’s his jam,” says Brooker, before adding that the jam phrase is not one he has used before. He does that sometimes, stepping aside from himself to have a listen to what is spewing from his mouth: is that good, bad, or just surprising, he seems to ask himself.

Does he make any attempts to limit the kids’ screen time I wonder. “I mean you try to a bit, but I don’t worry too much about that because I sort of think by the time they’re grown up the only job left will be robot polishing,” he says. “So they might as well enjoy themselves and get used to clicking things. I kind of think as long as they’re happy … I have heard myself saying: ‘It’s a lovely day outside, come on,’ which was my parents’ theme tune I remember in the summer holiday. ‘What are you doing sitting indoors, playing on the Spectrum? It’s sunny!’”

Brooker grew up in the village of Brightwell-cum-Sotwell in Oxfordshire. An early portent of what lay ahead was a comic he made himself, filled with violence, anger and jokes, and then sneaked into his primary school comic box.

At home his dad showed him repeats of Monty Python, and Charlie liked watching things like Not the Nine O’Clock News, Spitting Image, The Young Ones. “Generally speaking, shows that were tinkering about with the format. I remember seeing Airplane! in the cinema and thinking, ‘I didn’t know they made films like that, that’s the best film ever made!’ When I was a bit older I would stay up and catch The Twilight Zone. I always liked nasty, twist-in-the-tale type stories as well – Hammer House of Horror is another one, because it had this horrible British sensibility, so it looked like a sitcom but there were people being stabbed in the neck with trowels. Stuff that broke the fourth wall, was anarchic, The Young Ones, stuff that had a strong flavour.”

Around about the same time, at the local leisure centre, he discovered the first arcade games, such as Space Invaders and Pac-Man. “And thinking you can control that, that’s interesting.” Brooker now has a vintage arcade game at home.

He didn’t get a degree; Central London Poly didn’t want his dissertation on video games. So he played them instead, and smoked weed, and wrote comic strips and columns for a gaming magazine. He watched television, and he made the parody listings website TVGoHome that held a mirror up to the medium, like a tailor saying: “Look, Sir, Madam, look how absurd and grotesque you are.” And he wrote the Screen Burn column for the Guardian’s Guide, in which he did the same kind of thing in print.

Then, as well as hating television, Brooker started to make it too. He wrote for Channel 4’s The 11 O’Clock Show, and for Chris Morris’s brilliantly caustic spoof news show Brass Eye. With Morris, he wrote the hilarious series Nathan Barley, which managed to encapsulate everything that was ludicrous about the early 00s and was based on the TVGoHome entry Cunt. The Wipe shows followed – Screenwipe (kind of Screen Burn on telly) and Newswipe.

Somewhere around 2000 he met Annabel Jones, then an executive at Endemol, which was buying a piece of Zeppotron, the production company Brooker had accidentally set up with other 11 O’Clock Show writers but didn’t know how to run (I think it’s fair to say that running companies isn’t high on Brooker’s list of talents). They’ve been working together ever since.

And now they are co-showrunners of Black Mirror, the anthology series that looks at the world – now and in about 10 minutes – its people and technology, and worries and laughs and screams about it – as do you, the viewer. It’s as if Brooker, the writer, has stuck some kind of probe on your temple that reads your fears, and collates them into a cohesive story that is projected on to a screen that you have to watch. You want to watch, too, because it’s funny, and human and about characters you care about (as well as about yourself, who, of course, you care about more than anyone else). And somewhere, perhaps in a cloud, or just a dark room, Charlie Brooker sits with a joystick, controlling your thoughts, laughing maniacally, possibly screaming as well.

It all came about after Dead Set, a horror zombie satire Brooker and Jones made for Channel 4, that had nowhere to go because everyone had been killed off. Brooker and Jones talked about the lack of anthology shows on TV, that take an idea and explore it – and the world – in one episode. They imagined a kind of Twilight Zone for the age, dealing with relevant themes, and they pitched it to Channel 4. “Foolishly they said yes,” laughs Brooker.

It started in December 2011 with three episodes, including The National Anthem, in which the British prime minister is forced to have sex with a pig on live TV by a man who has kidnapped a favourite member of the royal family. There was a further series and a Christmas special. Then Black Mirror and Channel 4 parted company, which might have been the end of it if it hadn’t been picked up by Netflix, which has commissioned loads more, plus an experimental one-off-special, and has thrown money and love at it.

What started as a seed almost four decades ago in the comic box of an Oxfordshire primary school, germinated for years in an imagination fed on horror and humour, telly and tech and computer games, has grown into something huge.

We meet at Netflix’s central London offices. Brooker, man of the moment, arrives with an entourage like Kanye West to whooping and hollering from the assembled staff … no, of course he doesn’t. He shuffles out of the lift, bristly and pale in a tired looking T-shirt and hoodie, a man-child emerging from somewhere dark (like an edit suite, or the inside of his own head). Jones, 47, beside him, is as you would imagine a showrunner on a global TV series to be: presentable, groomed, articulate. She grew up in Pembrokeshire, not playing computer games, but watching telly – her early TV influences include Dennis Potter and Tales of the Unexpected. You can see echoes of Roald Dahl in a few BM episodes; the ones with a final rug-pull, such as Crocodile.

We’re shown to the boardroom, called Our Planet after the David Attenborough show, where there is a box of Queer Eye-branded tissues on the table and a big screen on the wall with a camera underneath, pointing at us. It’s for video conferencing, but there is also something appropriately sinister about it. “This is going out live on Netflix, probably,” says Brooker.

They like working for Netflix, and not just because of the money it throws at them. “You’re not being judged on the number of people watching a show, you’re being judged on how interesting it is, how much people like it, whether it creates a debate,” says Jones. In fact, they don’t even get to know what the viewing figures are.

She explains the problems with an anthology series for a traditional broadcaster: they’re expensive, sets have to be built for each episode, ratings tend to decrease over a run because of the lack of cliffhangers or continuity of cast. That’s what happened at Channel 4. It doesn’t matter how much people love it or talk about it: rising costs and falling viewers is not a combo beloved by broadcasters.

After the White Christmas one-off in December 2014, starring Jon Hamm, Brooker and Jones were in a state of limbo with Channel 4. They’d gone to LA to try to get US networks to co-produce a third series, but they returned without a deal, their champion at Channel 4, Shane Allen, had gone to the BBC, and the station’s bosses weren’t offering another series.

That’s when Netflix, which already had the back-catalogue, stepped in. “Suddenly those shows that are more word-of-mouth, and get talked about through friends or online rather than event-viewing, can prosper.” says Jones. “We found ourselves in a bidding war with all the people who had just said they didn’t want it and now realised they had to change their commissioning to compete with Netflix.” Netflix, which has about 150 million subscribers, tends to win bidding wars, and did.

I wonder what they now do differently for a global audience. Nothing, says Jones. “I think there’s a real worry that once you get commissioned for a global platform and try to make global shows, if you do that you are doomed, because then you are not making the film you have a personal experience of or affection for, and you start creating by numbers.”

One thing that has changed is that there has been a broadening of the range – of tone, genre and length. That was a deliberate decision brought about through necessity and because of the Netflix way of dumping a six-episode run all at once. If they’d all ended as bleakly and nihilistically as the seven Channel 4 episodes had, it could have got boring and predictable as well as unrelentingly despairing. “It was a conscious decision on my part,” says Brooker. “The first Netflix one I wrote, San Junipero, is one of our most uplifting, positive ones.” Also one of the most beautiful: a simulated-reality fairytale loaded with longing and despair, but in which love eventually overcomes loneliness.

The diversity continued into the second Netflix series. Contrast USS Callister, a colourful high-concept romp, and Metalhead, which is basically half an hour in black and white of Maxine Peake being chased by a canine deathbot, and one of the tensest, most excruciating half-hours you’re ever likely to spend. Metalhead is my own favourite. I still have nightmares about it.

“Did you ever think, ‘Why doesn’t she just throw her coat over it?’” Brooker asks. He means to stop the guard dog robot solar-recharging while Peake is up the tree. Someone had pointed this option out to him. No, I didn’t, but now I know, that’s what I’ll do when the time comes.

Brooker and Jones sit on one side of the table, addressing each other as much as they do me. They’re clearly close, more like siblings than work colleagues; siblings who share a world and get on but pretend that they don’t, and bicker.

How does it work between them, I want to know. “That’s assuming it does work between us,” says Brooker, cackling. He goes high-pitched when he gets animated, like he’s gulped down a lungful of laughing gas. Is this squeaky, jovial goon really the force behind such brilliant dark beauty?

I ask Jones to explain her role and Brooker interrupts. “Yeah, hang on, what do you do, who are you?”

She ignores him. “We have been working together for nearly 20 years, and I suppose there’s a familiarity…”

“... and disrespect between us that allows us to work very openly and candidly.” And so it continues.

When Jones goes to the loo, I ask Brooker what she does. “Fuck knows, she couldn’t explain could she?” Later, he gives in to generosity. “I’m often trying to either appal or amuse or entertain you with an idea,” he says, addressing her. “And you will say, ‘What do you mean by that?’ And you will sort of drag more of it out of me. Or sometimes you’ll put up blocks and say, ‘Well that wouldn’t work because…’ and I’ll go ‘Yeah but…’ and that sort of leads to a conversation.”

Jones is the first person to see the first draft of any script. They’ll work on it together before showing it to anyone else. She has a sicker sense of humour than he does, Brooker says. “You don’t like scatology, and the more you dislike it the further I go. I’m more childish, you are sick.”

Slowly, amid all the needling and – horrid word alert – banter, I’m getting some idea of how it works. While he is the creative force behind Black Mirror, she is the facilitator, the sounding board, as well as the grownup in the room if there are other people in it. Television executive people, for example. It’s probably fair to say Black Mirror would never have seen the light of day without Annabel Jones. Perhaps it’s her with the joystick, cackling ... except that she’s not into video games.

Are they friends? “I would say so,” says Brooker, faux reluctantly.

Do their partners get jealous? “Oh my God, they are grateful,” says Jones. Grateful that it keeps them out of the house. Brooker agrees.

The last episode – Jones rather grandly refers to them as films, though to be fair they have become more cinematic with Netflix’s financial might – was Bandersnatch. It was ... or is, as there is no past tense on Netflix ... interactive. So you, the viewer get to make decisions for the main character, a young programmer in 1980s Croydon. It’s an extraordinary achievement, groundbreaking even. Not just because of the logistical nightmare of making decision-tree television, but also because it throws up problems such as how do you create a proper, real character when you’re handing over a lot of the stuff that would make him a character (decision-making) to everyone else?

Bandersnatch overcomes the hurdles ingeniously. But for some of us traditional old farts who don’t want our television in kit form, it was just a bit too frumious. It’s been a long day, you want to put your feet up and watch something, you don’t want to torment someone in 1984. “The tricky thing is, it’s its own genre, like musicals, and some people don’t like musicals no matter what. Some people don’t want to make decisions, and that’s fair enough,” says Brooker. Before adding, inevitably, that they ... we ... can fuck off.

There’s no decision-making to be done in the three new episodes that land on 5 June. I’ve seen them and they’re fabulous, in different ways. I can’t tell you too much, obviously, or they’ll set the death-bots on me. But I can probably mention some of the themes that come out of them – ageing, long-term friendship, long-term relationships, commitment, pornography and reality, fantasy fulfilment, unfaithfulness, death, grief ... God it sounds bleak, but it’s not all bleak, there is light and laughter as well.

And Miley Cyrus is in one! She is great, in a starring role that is very personal to her and draws on her own experience, without giving too much away ... and there’s a Miley Cyrus robot.

For the tech and tech-related issues, think not far off – 10 minutes into the future if we’re not already. There are Alexas and smart speakers, next-level gaming (amazing gaming, and I’m not a gamer), gaming nostalgia, next-level porn, current-level social media, social media founders and CEOs, and digital data rights after death.

It’s not a show about technology though, says Jones. “I always get frustrated when people say it is. The stories are hopefully entertaining, very intimate stories about human failures and dilemmas.”

“We very rarely go: ‘Oh, I’ve read this news report and Samsung has invented a fridge that sings to you while you eat yoghurt,’” says Brooker. “No, that would be a terrible basis for an episode. It tends to be: wouldn’t it be weird if…”

He’s not denying the importance of tech to Black Mirror. “There is always a technological explanation for what is going on in our episodes – that’s what differentiates us from something like The Twilight Zone, where it is the supernatural or the uncanny or the unexplained.”

He mentions a famous Twilight Zone episode in which a woman goes into bus station and sees an identical copy of herself, which is not explained. “We wouldn’t do that. We’d have to come up with she’s in VR or she’s a clone. But that’s the only real difference. People didn’t say to Rod Serling [The Twilight Zone’s creator], what’s the show about magic and ghosts and aliens you’re doing, what is it about aliens that fascinates you so much? It was clear that that wasn’t what The Twilight Zone was about. I think it’s similar with Black Mirror: we are doing a supernatural show that has no supernatural element in it, and using that to tell stories that entertain, and that put people in really unusual situations and dilemmas that you can’t see elsewhere. That’s really what we are trying to do.”

What kind of criticism of BM gets his goat? “I guess if people take it too seriously, or think it takes itself too seriously. Or when people say ‘I want to do something like that, but with a sense of humour.’ I’m like: ‘For fuck’s sake, what’s wrong with you?’”

Actually Brooker doesn’t seem to be very angry about much. It is almost disappointing, when frothing apoplectic rage is what he is – or certainly was – famous for. “When I was doing columns, and doing the Wipe shows, that was me to an extent playing a character. TVGoHome was abrasive stuff, but it’s in character, sort of.”

What would 20 years ago Charlie Brooker, furious in his bedsit, think of new Charlie Brooker, successful, sunny and sweet? No he’s not having sunny and sweet. “I think I’m quite goonish, probably more goonish than I would portray in print, and probably more stupid.”

But to answer the question, he would have been astounded, he says. “That I would have been doing a show that people could see all over the place. I’d probably be pleased, yeah definitely pleased. I wonder if I’d like … yeah, I reckon I’d be into the show, that would be weird.”

Having kids has affected his world outlook, it can’t not have done. “Because you drop down the hierarchy in your own head, so you worry less about ephemeral things and more about, ‘Oh shit, what is the world going to be like?’ Now I worry less ‘Am I going to get incinerated in a nuclear fireball?’ and more ‘Is that going to happen to my children?’. Or, ‘Which of my children am I going to have to kill in the bunker, when there’s no way out?’”

Fire and no way out is a recurring worry it seems. I ask about the immense wealth that must have resulted from having a global hit, does that not help the outlook? “We don’t tend to swan around in yachts or anything like that,” says Brooker. He doesn’t look like a yachter to be fair. He has bought a pinball machine, the best pinball machine you can get, he admits. “We don’t walk around going we do this big successful show and blah blah blah, probably because we are…”

“And too fucked up. Speaking for myself there…”

“Because I genuinely think if someone gives you an award or something, I think, ‘Ugh, this is heavy, or I’m not going to win one next year’, or ‘Oh God, what if someone shoots me from the audience, where are the exits, what if this building catches fire?’”

OK, so sunny was wrong. Is he happy at least? “Erm, is anyone? Generally, I have my moments.”

What about the future of the show? “I think, because we can keep on reinventing it, there is no shortage of ideas.” he says. It would be hard to do an Airplane!-style comedy episode of Black Mirror, though he wanted to and has had to be talked out of it. Or a documentary episode, though they have discussed that too. “But other than that, if I look at the ones we have done, I think the tone of them is wildly different, so hopefully we can just keep doing them. Until the robots take over. Which will happen. One afternoon…”",0.998,
67,Technology,OnePlus 7 Pro review: an absolute beast in every way,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/31/oneplus-7-pro-review-an-absolute-beast-in-every-way,2019-05-31T06:00:27Z,"Fantastic screen, the fastest performance, a good camera and brilliant software in a massive phone that still undercuts the competition

The OnePlus 7 Pro is the firm’s largest, most expensive and most premium phone yet. While not that cheap, it still undercuts the competition by some margin, while offering sheer speed and a stunning notchless display that even its most expensive rivals can’t touch.

Starting at £649, the OnePlus 7 Pro is £150 more expensive than last year’s 6T or its 2019 refresh the 7 (non-Pro). It’s also significantly bigger.

The 6.67in QHD+ AMOLED screen is absolutely massive and runs at a refresh rate of 90Hz, meaning the screen updates 90 times per second – which is 50% faster than most phones and a first for an OLED screen. The difference is immediately noticeable, even simply scrolling in apps, web pages and between home screens. You quickly get used to it, of course, until you try to go back to a 60Hz phone.

The screen is also a seamless slate, with no cut-outs for sensors and selfie cameras. Instead the selfie camera is mounted in a motorised module that pops up from the top of the phone. With curved edges and tiny bezels all round, the OnePlus 7 Pro feels like the end of the road for traditional smartphone design. There’s nothing left on the front but screen.

The rest of the phone is fairly par for the course. There’s a USB-C port in the bottom, a triple camera lump on the back and no headphone socket. The curved glass front meets metal and more curved glass on the back. It’s a simple, attractive look, very reminiscent of Samsung’s phones for the last few years.

Despite the minimal bezels, there’s no getting over how big the OnePlus 7 Pro is: 206g in weight, 162.6mm tall, 75.9mm wide and 8.8mm thick. Huawei’s 6.47in P30 Pro is noticeably narrower at 73.4mm, while the 6.4in Samsung Galaxy S10+ is 74.1mm wide. Both phones are significantly lighter, too, weighing 192g and 175g respectively.

Only Apple’s iPhone XS Max, which is one of the hardest big phones to wield, is wider at 77.4mm and heavier at 208g.

All of that is to say the OnePlus 7 Pro is a stretch to use, right on the limit of what I can hold in one hand and not drop while clinging on to public transport, aided by the curved back and hard metal edge.

The OnePlus 7 Pro is the ultimate enthusiast-pleaser on paper, with its specifications reading like a fanboy wish list. It has Qualcomm’s latest top Snapdragon 855 processor with your choice of 6GB, 8GB or 12GB of RAM; 6GB is good, 8GB is ideal for 2019, and 12GB is total overkill.

But the OnePlus 7 Pro is also the first to use the new, significantly faster UFS 3.0 standard for its 128GB or 256GB of storage instead of the common UFS2.1. The only other phone to use UFS 3.0 is the £1,800 Samsung Galaxy Fold, which isn’t quite ready for prime time. Then there’s the new 90Hz screen and the 135Hz touch sensing rate, which detects your finger input faster.

All combined the OnePlus 7 Pro is, without doubt, the fastest-feeling Android smartphone by some margin. Everything is an instantaneous, buttery-smooth affair. Apps fly along with no hint of lag or stutter anywhere, as do games and everything else.

That’s not to say that other top-end phones are slow, but the OnePlus is faster, smoother and more fluid. It’s a joy to use even for mundane things and very difficult to go back once you have experienced it.

All that speed is backed up by solid but not exceptional battery life of about 28 hours between charges – enough to get you home after a night out or into work the next day without topping up.

That was as my primary device with the usual deluge of email, messages and push notifications, lots of browsing, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, watching 60 minutes of offline movies and shooting about 20 photos a day.

Setting the display to 60Hz added about an hour to the battery life. Gaming unsurprisingly had a fairly large effect on battery life.

There’s no wireless charging, but OnePlus’s new Warp 30 cable charging is very fast. A full charge took 75 minutes from dead, but it would hit 80% in about 45 minutes regardless of whether you were using the phone or not. Only Huawei’s 40W fast charging is quicker.

Oxygen OS 9.5 is OnePlus’s latest version of its customised Android software based on Android 9 Pie, and only features a few small changes since the version 9 on the OnePlus 6T.

Overall Oxygen OS is a refined version of standard Android, with polished elements and a little more customisation, making it one of the best versions of Android currently available. You also get three years of software updates from release.

There’s a choice standard Android navigation keys, Google’s “pill” navigation button or gestures, which are some of the smoothest and best implemented on Android to date – swipe up from the centre to go home, up and hold for recently used apps, or up and over to the right for the previously-used app. The back gesture, up from the left or right bottom edge, is easy to activate by accident – a swipe in from the left or right side of the screen is better.

Oxygen OS also comes with Zen Mode, which locks your phone for 20 minutes of time out, allowing only calls and photos, a gaming mode and a system called RAM boost, which learns which apps you use frequently and pre-caches them into RAM.

The only thing I don’t like about Oxygen OS is the “shelf”, which replaces Google’s Discover feed on the left-most homescreen pane. I don’t find it useful and turn it off. There’s also no real one-handed mode as others such as Huawei include, which for a phone this size would have been helpful.

The OnePlus 7 Pro has the firm’s second-generation in-display optical fingerprint reader, and it is significantly faster and more accurate than that used in last year’s OnePlus 6T.

While previous versions have been a convenience trade-off versus traditional capacitive sensors, the new in-screen sensor matches them for speed and accuracy. OnePlus has set the new standard; everything else feels slow compared with it.

Cameras have traditionally been a weak point for OnePlus phones. The OnePlus 7 Pro’s triple camera system combining a 48-megapixel main, a 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle and an 8-megapixel telephoto camera is a significant step up.

The primary camera is capable of capturing some really detailed and well-exposed shots. Occasionally it was a little too bright, requiring a bit of adjustment, but even low-light performance was good. The 3x telephoto camera is also good, but produces noticeably more noise in dull lighting than the main camera. The up to 10x digital zoom rivals some of the best, but isn’t in the same league as Huawei’s 50x zoom. The ultra-wide angle camera is great, too, capturing some really interesting shots.

Video quality was generally very good too, but could be a little yellow in indoor lighting. The selfie camera was also capable of capturing some impressive amount of detail that some might find a little too rich.

Overall, the OnePlus 7 Pro has a camera that can keep up with the best from Samsung and Apple, but isn’t quite as good as Huawei’s game-changing P30 Pro in zoom, flexibility or low-light performance.
• None It looks really good in blue, but even better in the limited edition almond
• None There’s a sharp edge in the bottom corners of the phone where the glass meets the metal
• None Auto-brightness often went too dim in normal indoor lighting requiring manual correction
• None It was too easy to invoke the pin code entry screen when shooting photos while the phone was locked
• None The new motion wallpapers are gorgeous
• None OnePlus’s alert slider, toggling between silent, vibrate and ring, continues to be excellent

The OnePlus 7 Pro costs £649 in black with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The version with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage costs £699 in black or blue, with almond available at a later date. The blue version with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage costs £799.

There will also be a 5G version available from EE in the UK on plans starting at £59 a month, and other operators globally.

For comparison, the 128GB OnePlus 7 will cost £499, the 128GB Huawei P30 Pro costs £899, the 128GB Huawei Mate 20 Pro costs £599, the 128GB Samsung Galaxy S10+ costs £899, the 64GB Google Pixel 3 XL costs £869, and the 64GB iPhone XS Max costs £1,099.

The OnePlus 7 Pro is a beast of a phone in every way. It has a genuinely huge screen, making it a really big device. If you don’t like large phones, this is most definitely not for you.

But that huge screen is arguably the best in the industry. It’s so smooth, beautiful and sucks you in like no other. Part of that is the sheer speed and smoothness of the phone, matching the level of polish only Apple and Google have managed, but made faster. Even the optical in-screen fingerprint sensor is super-fast, making everything else feel slow. This is the fastest-feeling smartphone available by some margin.

The camera is really good, too, which is a first for a OnePlus phone. It’s not the best in the business, but it’s no longer left in the dust by top-spec rivals.

It’s not perfect, of course. Battery life is good but not class-leading. There’s no wireless charging, which is pretty disappointing given the price, despite the fast wired charging. There’s no formal water resistance rating, no expandable storage and no headphone socket. And did I mention just how massive this phone is?

But what you get with the OnePlus 7 Pro is a phone that undercuts rivals on price and offers a better experience in almost every meaningful way. The OnePlus 7 Pro is a massive phone worth stretching for.

68,Technology,What is 5G and when can I get it in the UK?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/25/what-is-5g-and-when-can-i-get-it-in-the-uk,2019-05-25T06:00:38Z,"After years of hype, the switch will be flicked on the UK’s first 5G network on 30 May. Network operator EE, part of BT, will be first out of the blocks. According to telecoms and phone firms the benefits of 5G are obvious – but what exactly is it, how can you get it and how much is it going to cost?

It is the next generation mobile phone network and it promises much higher connection speeds, lower latency (response times) and to be more reliable than the creaking 4G networks we have now.

What will it do?

It will be much faster, with download speeds 5-10 times quicker than 4G to start with, meaning a movie will download in seconds rather than minutes. Over the next few years it should become even faster, as the technology matures. It will also have lower latency, the time it takes for something to happen: tap a link and the download will start faster.

But perhaps the most important thing 5G will immediately do for users is increase the carrying capacity of the masts, meaning more people can connect at the same time.

Who needs it?

Early adopters, anyone looking for raw speed and people who live in dense urban areas fed up with current 4G problems, such as when you appear to have a full signal but nothing happens when you tap a link.

“5G is like getting a seat on a packed train, or a lane of the motorway all to yourself,” said EE’s CEO, Marc Allera.

When can I get it?

EE will be the first the launch a 5G network in the UK on 30 May. Vodafone is following on 3 July. O2 and Three expect to launch their networks later this year.

The UK is one of the first countries in Europe to start rolling out 5G but Switzerland is the furthest along with 227 areas, according to the tracking firm Ookla. There are also limited areas in Finland, Italy, Poland and Spain.

5G networks are also up and running in parts of the US, Argentina, South Africa, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, China, South Korea and Australia.

Where can I get it?

EE is launching its 5G network in the busiest areas of Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh, London and Manchester. Later this year other areas will join, in Bristol, Coventry, Glasgow, Hull, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield.

Vodafone is kicking off its 5G network in parts of Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and London. Later this year it will flick the switch in Birkenhead, Blackpool, Bournemouth, Guildford, Newbury, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Reading, Southampton, Stoke-on-Trent, Warrington and Wolverhampton.

How much will it cost?

On EE: 5G costs £5 more than 4G, which means from £54 per month for 24 months with 10GB of data and a phone (£170 up front) or from £32 per month for 20GB for sim-only for 12 months.

On Vodafone: 5G plans cost the same as 4G plans, starting at £50 per month for 24 months with 5GB of data and a phone (£99 up front). The network does not offer sim-only 5G plans.

Do I need a new phone?

Yes. To access a 5G network you need a smartphone with a 5G modem. There are a handful now on sale, including Samsung’s Galaxy S10 5G, the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G, Xiaomi’s Mi Mix 3 5G, LG’s V50, Oppo Reno 5G and a few others.

Most 5G phones are top-of-the-line and therefore expensive. They are also big – with the largest screens.

How will I know I’m on 5G?

Simply put, you’ll see a “5G” icon in your smartphone’s status bar. But things are a little more complicated in the beginning. For the next couple of years, the 4G network is going to still be used for most things other than downloading data even when connected to 5G, including calls and managing connections.

It won’t be until 2022 that 5G will take over all of these “core network” functions and you will no longer drop down to the 4G network to make a call. A similar situation happened in the initial phases of the 3G to 4G transition.

But I’m already seeing the 5G icon on my old phone?

Some mobile networks in the US have decided to show their customers a “5G E” symbol on their old phones when in fact they are only connected to a variant of 4G.

No. As with 4G before it, there are a range of frequencies on which 5G can operate. Unlike 4G there’s a radical difference between them.

Across the UK the 5G networks will initially be launched on sub-6GHz frequencies, primarily between 3.4 and 3.6GHz (4G operates between 800MHz and 2.6GHz in the UK).

The higher the frequency, the higher the carrying capacity - and therefore the speed of the network.

But the higher the frequency the smaller the distance that can be covered effectively and the less well the radio waves can penetrate objects. So buildings, cars, people and any other obstacles can block the signal.

What will 5G enable in the future?

5G promises seamless, super fast connectivity for practically anything, which will enable all sorts of different functions to flourish but likely not until after 2023.

Some of the most common expected applications revolve around connected infrastructure, turning everything from lamp-posts and roads, to bins and bike racks into smart objects. In other words, the “internet of things”.

The most obvious and exciting revolution that 5G will help is in transport. With ubiquitous, ultra-low-latency connections it means cars, buses and roads could all talk to each other in real time, warning drivers of incidents, patches of black ice or removing the need for the driver at all, in the world of self-driving cars.

Other predicted services include all manner of robots, augmented reality, mobile gaming and of course super-fast video downloads.",0.9746,
69,Technology,Markets slide as Panasonic joins list of firms walking away from Huawei,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/23/huawei-markets-slide-as-panasonic-joins-list-of-firms-cut-ties,2019-05-23T04:43:58Z,"Panasonic has joined the growing list of companies to sever ties with Huawei by announcing that it will stop supplying some components to the Chinese technology conglomerate after a US ban over security concerns.

The decision by the Japanese firm on Thursday sent Asia Pacific shares falling again and came a day after four major Japanese and British mobile carriers said they would delay releasing new Huawei handsets.

“We’ve stopped all business transactions with Huawei and its 68 group companies ... that are subject to the US government ban,” Joe Flynn, a Panasonic spokesman, said.

Panasonic joins Google, Intel, Qualcomm and Lumentum among the leading companies to turn their backs on Huawei in what is beginning to shape up as a tech cold war between the US and China.

The British company ARM Holdings, which licenses chip designs to Apple, Huawei, Qualcomm and Samsung among others, said on Wednesday it had halted relations with Huawei in order to comply with the US ban.

Washington has brought pressure to bear on businesses in friendly countries to follow suit. On Thursday it was reported that the US government was lobbying South Korea not to use Huawei products, a newspaper reported on Thursday.

In one incident, a US official said in a recent meeting with a South Korean counterpart that local telco LG Uplus, which uses Huawei’s equipment, should “not be allowed to serve in sensitive areas in South Korea”, Chosun Ilbo reported.

The official added that Huawei needed be eventually driven out of the country, if not immediately.

It has also been reported that the Trump administration was considering Huawei-like sanctions on Chinese video surveillance firm Hikvision because of the country’s treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority.

The worsening standoff between the two economic superpowers pushed Asia Pacfic shares to their lowest point in four months on Thursday.

Blue-chip stocks in Shanghai shed 1.5% in response to be near their lowest since February. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 0.9% to reach its lowest in four months.

“Both the US and China appear to be preparing for a prolonged period of trade conflict,” wrote analysts at Nomura in a note on the standoff.

“We think domestic pressures and constraints will drive both sides towards further escalation,” they warned. “Without a clear way forward during an intensifying 2020 US presidential election, we see a rising risk that tariffs will remain in effect through end 2020.”

Shares in Panasonic were down 1% on news that it was joining the US boycott.

The company said its business with Huawei included the supply of “electronic parts,” but declined to provide further details.

Washington’s restrictions affect products made fully or partially in the United States, where Panasonic manufactures some of the components it supplies to Huawei, the Japanese firm said.

A Panasonic official declined to comment on what business the Japanese firm would continue to do with Huawei, though reports said the suspension would have a limited impact.

Last week, US President Donald Trump declared a national emergency to bar US companies from using foreign telecoms equipment deemed a security risk.

The move appeared aimed at Huawei, though the White House said no particular company or country was targeted.

In Britain, the telecoms company EE, which is owned by BT, was due to bring Huawei’s first 5G phone, the Huawei Mate 20X, to the country, but the Chinese firm’s involvement in the UK telecoms sector has become politically controversial.

EE chief executive Marc Allera said the company had “paused” the launch of Huawei’s 5G phones “until we get the information and confidence and the long-term security that our customers... are going to be supported”.

The group also said it would phase out the use of Huawei equipment in the most sensitive “core” elements of its network infrastructure.

Vodafone soon followed suit, announcing a “temporary” suspension of pre-orders for Huawei handsets, “while uncertainty exists”.",-0.8641,
70,Technology,Honor 20: Huawei Android phone launch defies Donald Trump,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/21/honor-20-launch-huawei-quad-camera-phone,2019-05-21T14:46:14Z,"Huawei’s Honor is trying to dominate the increasingly crowded cut-price premium phone market with the launch of two new top-spec phones, the Honor 20 and Honor 20 Pro, flying in the face of the US blockade.

With Apple, Samsung and now Huawei ceding the space of the sub-£600 top-end phone as starting prices have risen beyond £900, Honor’s latest offering continues the winning trend of flagship hardware at more reasonable prices.

The £400 Honor 20 and 20 Pro are practically identical, with the same glass front and back design and the flagship Huawei Kirin 980 processor last seen in the Huawei P30 Pro. The Honor 20 has 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, while the Honor 20 Pro has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Both phones run Huawei’s modified version of Android 9 Pie called Magic UI 2.1, and will have Google’s services included in western markets such as the UK.

Both phones have a 6.26in LCD screen that fills the front of the display with a small hole cut out in the top left corner through which the 32-megapixel selfie camera pokes. It’s a design the company used to great effect last year in the larger Honor View 20.

A fingerprint sensor is integrated into the power button on the right side of the phone, there’s a USB-C port in the bottom and no headphone socket to be found.

The main area where the two phones differ is the camera system on the back.

The Honor 20 has a new quad-camera setup, with a traditional 48-megapixel main camera, a 16-megapixel super-wide-angle camera and a 2-megapixel depth camera, which is used for the prerequisite portrait mode. The fourth camera is more unusual: a 2-megapixel macro camera, dedicated to super close-up shots.

The Honor 20 Pro adds optical image stabilisation to the main 48-megapixel camera, has the same 16-megapixel super-wide-angle camera and 2-megapixel macro camera, but swaps the depth-sensing camera for an 8-megapixel camera with a 3x optical zoom.

The Honor 20 Pro also supports up to 5x hybrid zoom, which uses the other cameras to fill in details beyond the optical zoom, and up to 30x digital zoom. Honor hopes that the new camera system will be capable of matching some of the best camera phones in the business. Camera rating firm DxOMark gave the Honor 20 Pro a score of 111, placing it one point behind the current leader, the Huawei P30 Pro.

But the phone launches into an ultra-competitive market, which sees Google’s Pixel 3a XL, Samsung’s Galaxy A-series and the OnePlus 7 battling it out. They also may be the last Huawei smartphones launched in the west with Google services on board, following the firm’s blacklisting by the US.

Whether Honor can succeed in such challenging conditions remains to be seen. But if concerns surrounding Donald Trump’s blacklisting can be overcome, Huawei may have another Honor hit on its hands.

The Honor 20 is available for pre-order from Tuesday for £400 in the UK and €499 in Europe. Honor said availability for the 20 Pro, which will cost €599 (£525) in Europe, would only be “released in the near future” but did not say whether this delay was planned or due to the US action against Huawei.

71,Technology,Pixel 3a XL review: the cheaper Google phone to buy,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/17/google-pixel-3a-xl-review-camera-android-software,2019-05-17T06:00:09Z,"With a price-tag of £469, the Pixel 3a XL tries to offer the best of Google, but costing £400 less than its top-end sibling

The bigger brother of Google’s other lower-cost phone, the Pixel 3a, the new Pixel 3a XL offers the same winning combination of great camera and software. It offers practically everything that makes Google’s top £869 Pixel 3 XL good, shrunk in both cost and weight.

The Pixel 3a XL is plastic, but mirrors the frosted and gloss design of its more expensive glass and metal phone. It feels solid in the hand, with only a little flex in the body. It’s also pretty light for a phone with a 6in screen, weighing 167g compared with the Pixel 3 XL’s 184g or the Honor View 20’s 180g.

Low weight is a good thing, because the Pixel 3a XL is not the smallest or easiest of phones to handle. At 76.1mm wide with rounded sides and a flat back, it is fairly difficult to grip in one hand and reach the other side of the screen with your thumb - reaching the back button with your right thumb, for instance.

Narrower phones with rounded backs and harder edges, such as the 75.4mm wide Honor View 20, are much easier to grip and therefore less likely to be dropped. You will definitely need a case on the Pixel 3a XL, before it hits concrete.

Part of the Pixel 3a XL’s width is the fairly large bezels around the screen, including chunky top and bottom sections of the front. It gives the phone a dated look compared with rivals, despite the 6in FHD+ OLED looking good.

As with the smaller Pixel 3a, the top of the phone has a headphone jack, and the bottom a USB-C port and a speaker, which joins the earpiece speaker to make a stereo pair. The back of the phone has a fast and accurate fingerprint sensor.

The Pixel 3a XL has one of Qualcomm’s recent mid-range processors, the Snapdragon 670, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. It comes in three colours, but there’s no way to increase the storage.

Unsurprisingly, the Pixel 3a XL performs exactly the same as its smaller sibling the Pixel 3a. That means it handles better than its paper specifications might suggest, thanks to Google’s excellent software. But it is also nowhere near as fast as phones with flagship-level chips and faster memory, which are available for less than the £469 asking price of the Pixel 3a XL.

Battery life was satisfactory, coming in at 27 hours between charges – three hours longer than the smaller Pixel 3a. That was when used as my primary device, with hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, four hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 45 minutes of Netflix and 10 photos a day.

The Pixel 3a would make it from 7am to 11pm with about 35% battery left and then on to 11am the next day. That is stamina enough to get you into work the next day if you have forgotten to charge it, or to get you home after a night out.

There’s no wireless charging, and the 18W fast charging is fairly slow by today’s standards, reaching 65% in about an hour, and a full charge within two hours.

While performance was fairly middling, the software on the Pixel 3a is anything but.

The software is exactly the same as that running on the Pixel 3 XL and Pixel 3a, including Google’s various Pixel-first features such as AR navigation in Google Maps, Now Playing ambient music recognition and squeeze to activate Google Assistant.

It will also get at least three years of both Android version updates and monthly security updates, making it one of the very few Android smartphones to do so. While updates aren’t a whizz-bang feature, they are very important all round – as the recent WhatsApp hack has shown – and an area where third-party manufacturers lag far behind. The Pixel 3a will even get Android Q before practically anything else.

Beyond software, the camera is the primary selling point for the Pixel 3a XL. It has the same stellar, competition-beating camera as the Pixel 3 and 3 XL, including Top Shot, HDR+, Super Res Zoom, motion-tracking auto-focus and Night Sight features.

Simply put, it’s very difficult to capture a bad photo. Point it in the right direction, hit the button and get fantastic images nearly every time.

There’s no optical zoom or ultra-wide angle camera, but the selfie camera performance is good, as is video capture, although it caps out at 30fps at 4K. There’s no “pro” or manual mode, but you can shoot in RAW. Google Photos provides unlimited photo and video backup to the cloud, but only in “high quality”, not in original form, unlike the more expensive Pixel 3. It’s a service that’s available to any Google Photos user, including those on Apple’s iPhone.
• None The matt plastic sounds like vinyl when you run your nail over it
• None The stereo speakers work fairly well with one firing out the bottom of the phone
• None The screen is covered by the cheaper Dragontail not Gorilla Glass
• None The compass failed to point in the right direction more often than competitors
• None Call quality was fine, but it was often slow to pick up a signal when coming out of the London Underground
• None Anecdotally, turning off Google’s Digital Wellbeing tracking appeared to alleviate some sluggishness

The Google Pixel 3a XL comes in three colours costing £469.

For comparison, the smaller Pixel 3a costs £399, the Pixel 3 XL costs £869, the Honor View 20 costs £399, the OnePlus 6T costs £499, the Samsung Galaxy S10e costs £669 and the Apple iPhone XR costs £749.

The Pixel 3a XL is very nearly a great lower-cost Google phone. The trouble is, it isn’t that cheap, and it’s a bit too bulky and hard to grip.

The 6in screen isn’t actually that big by today’s standards, but the overall width, flat back and rounded edges of the phone almost guarantee you will drop it if you are attempting to use it one-handed. If ever there was a phone you should put a ring or grip on the back of, this is it.

You still get that cracking camera, great software, long and thorough software update support and almost everything that made Google’s more expensive Pixel 3 phones great.

In the US the Pixel 3a XL doesn’t have that much in the way of good competition at its $479 price point. But in the UK and Europe there are plenty of phones available with flagship, not mid-range performance, and nearly as good cameras for about the £469 price of the Pixel 3 XL, including the £399 Honor View 20.

The Pixel 3a XL is a good but not great phone for £469. If you are after a cheaper Google phone, it’s still the one to buy over the Pixel 3a, simply because of the battery life being acceptable.

So buy one for the camera and software, and I’m sure you will be very pleased for several years. Just don’t go in thinking it’s dirt cheap or the best thing ever.

72,Technology,How can I increase my laptop’s storage space?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/may/16/how-can-i-increase-my-laptops-storage-space,2019-05-16T07:00:27Z,"The Dell Inspiron 15-5577 was sold as an affordable 15.6in gaming laptop with an Intel Core i5 or i7 Kaby Lake (7th generation) processor and an Nvidia GTX 1050 graphics chip. It costs from £799 to £1,299 depending on the processor, graphics, storage and type of screen installed. It also has an Ethernet port, three USB 3.0 ports and a full-size SD card slot.

Reviews suggested the base-level screen was somewhat lacking and one said the 256GB SSD was slow. However, if your machine’s screen meets your needs then it is a good specification for your purposes.

Now you can get extra benefits from its ability to handle upgrades. You should certainly be able to do these yourself, with the help of the service manual and couple of YouTube videos.

There’s only one screw to hold the back on your laptop, so physically installing an M2 SSD and an 8GB memory module is a two-minute job. With some upgradeable laptops, it can take longer to get the back off.

If you’re a bit geeky, the best way to find out what’s inside a PC is to run Sandra Lite. This will tell you lots of things you didn’t know, and several things you would rather not know. But if you’re a normal person, just go to your local Crucial website. You don’t even need to know which make or model of laptop you own. Crucial has a small utility that will analyse your PC and tell you which SSD and memory upgrades will be compatible, so you can buy them on the spot.

You can, of course, use the information to shop around. I’ve been a happy Crucial customer for many years, and no longer bother.

In your case, the crucial info is whether the 256GB SSD occupies your laptop’s SATA drive bay or whether it fits into the separate M2 NVMe slot (take the back off and see if the drive bay is empty). Whichever one you have, buy the other.

If your laptop has its SSD in the drive bay, you could add a 250GB Crucial MX500 SSD (£37.19) or 500GB SSD (£61.19) to the M2 slot.

If your SSD is in the M2 slot, you should be able to install a 240GB Crucial BX500 SSD (£26.39) or a 480GB SSD (£51.59) in the empty drive bay. Alternatively, you could install a 1TB 2.5in hard drive for under £40.

Most of the benefits of having an SSD come from using it as the boot drive to run the operating system and your main applications. You should be OK with data stored on a spinning hard drive, especially if you use it on mains power and tell it not to spin down. People have been doing this for decades.

If you find you really need SSD speeds, you can always copy, for example, the loops and samples you are actually using in a music production to the SSD.

Either way, you should get a very economical upgrade. People who are upgrading laptops often have to throw away or repurpose the old part but you’ll be able to keep your current SSD.

Note: Dell’s User Manual (PDF) says that the 15-5577’s M.2 storage slot supports both PCIe NVMe SSDs and SATA SSDs “up to 512 GB (PCIe SSD)”. M.2 PCIe NVMe is the way to go. It also says that 1TB is the maximum hard drive capacity but I can’t see why a SATA SSD wouldn’t work. That’s exactly the job they were designed to do.

Again, you’re in luck. The Dell 15-5577 usually shipped with one 8GB memory module and one empty slot. You should therefore be able to install a second 8GB module (£45.59 from Crucial) and expand the memory to 16GB.

I strongly recommend this. Microsoft Windows loves memory and 8GB is my minimum for normal (as distinct from light) computer use. For heavyweight tasks such as music production and graphic design, it’s much better to have 16GB or even 32GB. Unfortunately, while your laptop can handle 32GB, it would mean buying two 16GB modules (£179.99) and dumping the 8GB you already have. If you really want to invest that sort of money, it would be better to spend it on one 8GB memory module plus a bigger or faster SSD, such as a Samsung 850 EVO.

Before you attempt the upgrade, read the relevant parts of the Dell service manual for your laptop, including stuff about turning off the power and avoiding the perils of static electricity.

After that, it’s always worth searching for YouTube videos. The Windows Central website has one on upgrading RAM & SSD for Dell Inspiron 15 7559 gaming laptop, with most of the three-minute running time devoted to moving Windows to the new SSD.

Your laptop has a full SD card slot and USB 3.0 ports, so you have other options, too. For example, you could add 128GB of storage in seconds by inserting a U3/V30-class Samsung EVO SD card (£21.39) or a SanDisk Extreme Pro SDXC card (£40.77). The latter should be faster.

You probably won’t get the claimed speeds in your laptop but these cards should be fast enough for some purposes, including backups. If nothing else, a couple of cards would free up space on your current 256GB SSD because you can’t be using all your data all the time.

The advantage of using SD cards is that you can leave one in the PC all the time, except for swapping in the second card when you need to back up your current project. This is always wise when you’re working away from home.

It would be even cheaper to use USB 3.0 thumb drives such as the 128GB SanDisk Ultra Flair (£22.83), which claims transfer speeds of “up to 150MBps”. The drawback is that you have to keep inserting and removing them. USB ports are not my favourite connection for constant use.

Finally, while you’re not keen on external drives, there are some fast, small SSDs that are designed for portability and durability. For example, have a look at the 512GB Adata SD700 (£96.25). It’s dustproof, waterproof and military-grade shockproof. It’s also tiny, at 8.33cm square and only 1.4cm thick. It’s not a pain to carry one around.

Less robust alternatives include the SanDisk Extreme portable SSD, which weighs only 38.9g, the Samsung MU-PA500B and the WD My Passport Portable, among others.

Unfortunately, to achieve their impressive maximum speeds, most external SSDs rely on Windows laptops having a USB 3.1 (Gen 2) Type-C port, which – sadly – you have not got. However, USB 3.0 is still fast enough to be useful.

73,Technology,OnePlus 7 Pro phone launch: massive screen and pop-up camera,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/14/oneplus-7-pro-phone-launch-massive-screen-and-pop-up-camera,2019-05-14T16:00:37Z,"Having made a name for itself for cut-price top-spec phones, OnePlus now has its sights set on the Samsung Galaxy S10+ and Huawei P30 Pro with its new OnePlus 7 Pro.

Costing from £649 the new premium OnePlus still undercuts the competition by about £250, but isn’t quite as value-oriented as previous offerings.

Instead the OnePlus 7 Pro is the firm’s biggest yet with a giant, notch-free 6.67in QHD+ AMOLED display, which fills the entire front of the device, curving at the edges with some of the slimmest bezels seen on any phone. The selfie camera has even moved to the top of the phone, popping out when required.

The screen also supports HDR+ and is one of the first on the market with a refresh rate of 90Hz, something usually reserved for ugly gaming phones, which the firm says improves smoothness in scrolling and games. A budget phone this is not.

The theme of speed is clear, with an impressive list of specifications. The OnePlus 7 Pro has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor, which is claimed to be 45% higher performing than last year’s Snapdragon 845. Like other high-end phones the OnePlus also features a liquid cooling system, plus the latest version of the firm’s Warp Charge technology for some of the fastest cabled charging available.

The OnePlus 7 Pro also comes with 6GB, 8GB or 12GB of RAM – three times that fitted to Google’s Pixel 3 – and a system that caches the apps you use most into that enormous amount of RAM so they load faster.

The OnePlus 7 Pro is the first on the market to use the new UFS3.0 standard for storage, which means the 128GB or 256GB of storage built into the phone is theoretically more than twice as fast as that used in any other phone. OnePlus thinks users will be to tell the difference even in the most mundane day-to-day activities.

Even the firm’s optical fingerprint scanner, which is embedded underneath the lower section of the screen, has been improved to be both faster and more accurate than that used in the OnePlus 6T last year.

The 16-megapixel selfie camera electrically pops up from the top of the phone when required - a mechanism OnePlus says it tested more than 300,000 times – the equivalent of 150 times a day for five-and-and-a-half years.

New for the 7 Pro is the company’s first triple camera system on the back, including a 48-megapixel main camera, 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle and eight-megapixel 3x telephoto camera. OnePlus hopes that this new camera setup will be able to right one of weaknesses of its previous phone and challenge the best in an increasingly competitive market.

The OnePlus 7 Pro will come in a choice of three colours costing £649 for 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, £699 for 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage or £799 for 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.

Alongside the 7 Pro, OnePlus also launched a revamped version of last year’s 6T called the OnePlus 7, which will be available in June starting at £499 with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.

The cheaper phone looks practically identical to last year’s model but has the same Snapdragon 855 processor, RAM and UFS3.0 storage as the 7 Pro. It also has the same 48-megapixel main camera too, but paired only with a secondary depth camera for portrait mode effects.

74,Technology,Pixel 3a review: the people’s Google phone?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/14/google-pixel-3a-review-camera-software-bzttery-android,2019-05-14T05:00:27Z,"Great camera and software make a bargain, let down only by middling performance and battery

Google’s latest phone, the Pixel 3a, offers the firm’s fantastic camera and software for less than £400, cutting a few corners on the way.

The pitch for the Pixel 3a is simple: everything that made the £739 top-end Pixel 3 good, but at a lower price.

From the outside it’s not immediately obvious what has changed. Google ported the look and feel of its more expensive glass and metal phones into high-quality plastic. It even has the matt back panel with a gloss window at the top, and the same large bezels at the top and bottom of the screen.

Gone are the front-facing stereo speakers and the dual selfie camera, leaving a more basic look on the front. The 5.6in FHD+ OLED screen is very good for the money, rivalling that fitted to the more expensive Pixel 3 if not quite reaching the quality of phones such as Samsung’s Galaxy S10+ or Huawei’s P30 Pro.

The top of the phone heralds the surprise return of the headphone socket, while the back has the same excellent fingerprint scanner as fitted to the Pixel 3. There’s no face recognition or other biometric unlock option.

The Pixel 3a is a light and fairly small phone by today’s standards, making it one of the easiest modern smartphones to hold and use one-handed. Weighing 147g it’s 1g lighter than the Pixel 3 and considerably lighter than the 180g Honor View 20, one of its main rivals.

Overall the Pixel 3a feels well made and fairly sturdy, if not quite as premium as similarly priced metal and glass rivals. When most people will put it in a case, that point is likely moot.

The Pixel 3a comes in three colours but only one version, which has one of Qualcomm’s recent mid-range processors, the Snapdragon 670, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.

To make this perfectly clear: unlike the more expensive Pixel 3, the Pixel 3a is not a top-performing smartphone. The Snapdragon 670 is significantly slower than the flagship chips such as the Snapdragon 845/855 or Huawei’s Kirin 980, and the Pixel 3a uses slower eMMC storage too.

On the whole the Pixel 3a performs far better than its paper specs might suggest, which goes to show how important optimisation of the software is to a phone’s performance.

Swiping between home pages is smooth. Switching between recently used apps is fairly quick too, and once loaded apps run fine. It’s only when you try doing something a little taxing, such as shooting a burst of photos, installing a new large app, or loading an app not recently used that you see the Pixel 3a’s performance dip.

It performs fine for a lower-end phone, but at £400 it isn’t that cheap, meaning there are significantly faster phones with flagship components available in the UK and Europe costing the same or less.

Battery life is disappointing too, coming in at just under 24 hours between charges when used as my primary device, with hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, four hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 45 minutes of Netflix and 10 photos a day.

The Pixel 3a would make it from 7am to 11pm with about 10% battery left, but then would often be dead by the morning. Turning off the always-on display added about two hours of life, but it still won’t have the staying power to get you home after a night out without being topped up during the day.

At least the 18W fast charging is fairly rapid up to about 80%. There’s no wireless charging.

While performance and battery life is slightly disappointing, the software on the Pixel 3a is anything but.

The software is exactly the same as running on the Pixel 3, including Google’s various Pixel-first features such as AR navigation in Google Maps, Now Playing ambient music recognition and squeeze-to-activate Google Assistant.

It will also get at least three years of both Android version updates and monthly security updates, making it one of the very few Android smartphones to do so. While updates aren’t a whizz-bang feature, they are very important and something on which third-party manufacturers lag far behind. The Pixel 3a will even get Android Q before practically anything else.

Beyond software, the camera is the primary selling point for the Pixel 3a and for good reason. It has the same stellar, competition-beating camera as the Pixel 3 with all the bells and whistles attached. Point, shoot and get fantastic images nearly every time.

Top Shot, HDR+, Super Res Zoom, Google’s excellent motion-tracking auto-focus and the brilliant Night Sight are all included. New since the launch of the Pixel 3 is a timelapse feature, which works surprisingly well.

While the Huawei P30 Pro has bettered Google’s camera in zoom, flexibility and low-light performance, the camera on the Pixel 3a still tops any phone costing any amount of money on fine detail and HDR.

The selfie camera is also very good, as is video capture performance. Simply put: you have to spend literally twice as much on a P30 Pro to get a better camera than this.
• None The matt plastic sounds like vinyl when you run your nail over it
• None Haptic vibrations are much better than the competition at this price
• None The stereo speakers work fairly well with one firing out the bottom of the phone
• None The screen is covered by the cheaper Dragontail, not Gorilla Glass

The Google Pixel 3a comes in three colours and costs £399.

For comparison, the bigger Pixel 3a XL costs £469, the Pixel 3 costs £739, the Honor View 20 costs £399, the OnePlus 6T costs £499, the Samsung Galaxy S10e costs £669 and the Apple iPhone XR costs £749.

The Pixel 3a is a very important product to Google. It marks a return to cheaper but good phones, and it brings many of the excellent features from the £739 Pixel 3 to under £400.

The camera is simply better than anything else at this price and so is the software. You also get a full three years of monthly security and Android version updates, and access to Google’s features first including the upcoming Android Q.

But in getting down to the £400 price point Google has had to cut a few corners. A plastic body with large bezels and a good screen is fine. Poor battery life and slower hardware is less so.

It’s not that using the Pixel 3a is like treacle, it’s just that for the same money in the UK and Europe you can get smartphones with much faster, flagship hardware and significantly longer battery life. That’s not the case in the US, which makes the Pixel 3a much more tempting across the Atlantic.

So the Pixel 3a is a good start, but an opportunity missed to become the king of the mid-range.

75,Technology,Apple's iPhone cost faces sharp increase as US-China trade dispute worsens,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/13/iphone-price-cost-apple-latest-us-china-trump-trade-war-news,2019-05-13T16:46:57Z,"The escalating trade dispute between the US and China could prove damaging to Apple and its customers by pushing up the cost of iPhones and driving down the share price.

According to a report by Morgan Stanley, the new Trump-imposed tariff of 25% on $200bn of Chinese-made goods could add about $160 (£124) to the cost of a Chinese-made iPhone XS, which starts at $999.

Apple could shield consumers from the price hike, but on Monday concern over the trade dispute pushed shares down close to 6% to $186, the sharpest decline in its share price since 2013. Apple stock is down 11% since the start of the month, placing it officially in what market analysts term “correction” territory.

In further bad news for Apple, the US supreme court on Monday allowed a major antitrust class action to move forward. By a 5-4 vote, with the conservative justice Brett Kavanaugh joining the four liberals on the panel, the court ruled that plaintiffs should be given the chance to try to prove Apple used monopoly power to raise the prices of iPhone apps.

Shipments of iPhones to North America, Apple’s largest market, fell 19% to 14.6m units in the first three months of the year. Tariffs could also affect iPhone sales in China, where Apple commands 7.4% of the market and where it has seen sales drop 25% in the past six months.

On Monday, China announced plans to apply 25% duties on 2,493 US products, starting on 1 June. Donald Trump accused China of backing out of an agreement with US trade officials and tweeted a warning that “China should not retaliate – will only get worse!”

The tensions hit US stocks broadly, costing the Dow Jones 617 points at the close of trading. Apple and Boeing were two of the shares hardest hit. In a research note, Goldman Sachs said the US-China clash could raise consumer prices even more and dent US economic growth.

Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, has tried publicly to play down tensions, describing the US-China trade relationship as “big and complex” and one that required “a level of focus and a level of updating and modernization”.

Apple has nonetheless reportedly stepped up efforts to shift production from China. Unlike Samsung, which has plants in Vietnam, China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and Korea, Apple uses a Chinese supply chain for all its products, from iPhones to iPads and Mac computers.

Trump called on Monday for companies to operate in the US or at least away from China. But for Apple, moving production away from Hon Hai Precision Industry, a division of the manufacturing giant FoxConn, would be time-consuming and difficult, analysts said.

According to Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, Apple has considered moving some production to India or Brazil. But although it could create a backup plan for suppliers, assembly processes would be far more difficult to replicate.

“Apple will be exploring all options and this will be the definition of a slow turn because they really don’t have a credible alternative avenue to build phones,” Munster told the Guardian.

“When Apple thinks about its business, it thinks in 10-year increments, so it makes sense for them to have other phone manufacturing and assembly that’s not just focused on China.”

Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities said that under the new 25% tariff Cook would relocate 3% to 5% of Chinese production, most likely to India.

The cost of the tariffs to consumers is not easy to calculate, because the new 25% tariff is levied on components, not the finished product. (Apple’s AirPods and Apple Watches are spared additional tariffs.)

“It’s [wrong] to think the cost of the iPhone will simply rise 25%,” said Tim Bajarin at Creative Strategies, a tech industry analysis firm. “Certain pieces indicate a cost but schedule doesn’t directly go after the phones. We don’t know what the cost of those components are, and we won’t unless Apple clarifies that.”

In recent months, Cook has noted that some components, such as the smartphone’s glass cover, are manufactured in the US then shipped to China for assembly. But the key question for Apple remains the same as for other western firms using Chinese manufacturers which will be hit by raised tariffs.

“The loser in the end is the US and Chinese consumer,” said Munster.",-0.1598,
76,Technology,Five of the best wireless earbuds: a guide for all budgets,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/11/five-best-wireless-earbuds-bluetooth-apple-airpods-samsung-galaxy-buds,2019-05-11T09:00:03Z,"Earbuds are great for some personal listening in the office, on the commute or at the gym, but wires are a pain, and headphone sockets are disappearing from our smartphones.

Bluetooth earbuds have long been available with a wire between them that runs round the back of your neck, but that can be frustrating as it often gets caught on clothing. The next generation of truly wireless earbuds solves the problem by getting rid of the wires entirely.

Most budget true wireless earbuds simply don’t work properly, offering a maddening experience that will drive most potty. Anker’s Liberty Lite (also known as the Liberty Neo) are one of the few exceptions.

They support SBC and AAC, maintain a strong connection to your phone and between the buds have no noticeable lipsync issues when watching video. A single button on either earbud takes care of playback controls, but not volume. They sound pretty good for the money with relatively pronounced bass and crisp highs, but are a little shrill at times, which makes listening at higher volumes wearing. There’s no app or equaliser available and there’s an audible hiss when the music is paused. Call quality was abysmal - look elsewhere if you want to use them for hands-free calls.

The Ankers last around three hours of playtime with three full charges available in the case, for a total of 12 hours. The case is a little bigger than the best, but still fairly pocketable. The earbuds are also a little bigger, sticking more noticeably out of your ear than some others. Their protruding design means they are comfortable, with plenty of tips and wings in the box to get the right fit and no need for stalks.

Arguably the Android world’s answer to Apple’s AirPods, the Samsung Galaxy Buds nail almost every aspect.

They are the most comfortable buds in this group, only slightly larger than the tiniest. They come with a variety of wings and tips in the box, but stay put just fine without any extra support, fitting directly into the concha of even smaller ears.

A touch panel on the outside takes care of play control and other bits, including volume, and works great. They support SBC, AAC and Samsung’s proprietary scalable codec if you’re using a Galaxy phone. Connectivity to all phones was great, and either bud can be used independently and swapped with the other without missing a beat.

There were no lipsync issues, and pairing them with various devices was super-quick. Call quality was fairly good, but a bit quiet – meaning you might have to shout a bit.

They sound good, too, with fairly balanced, crisp audio backed up by a reasonable amount of bass. The included tips block out sound fairly well, but there’s a mode for piping ambient sound into your ear if you want more awareness of what’s happening around you.

The Galaxy Buds have an equaliser and app that handles updates, but it’s only available for Android. They work great with an iPhone, but need updating out of the box so they are not recommended for iOS-only users.

The case is tiny, fitting in the money pocket of a pair of jeans, second only to the AirPods, with wireless and USB-C charging too. You get up to six hours of playtime from the buds and an extra seven hours in the case.

They come in white, black and yellow. A bargain at £139, but are often found much lower so look out for deals from reputable retailers.

Apple’s AirPods are wildly popular and for good reason: they work really well.

If you have an iPhone, they automatically pair and sync with your other Apple gear. Android and Windows PC users can also pair them manually, which is only slightly more labour intensive.

Connectivity is rock-solid, although limited to SBC and AAC. You can use either earbud on its own, and swap between them. Syncronization between video and audio is perfect. They even sound pretty good, with reasonable bass and balanced treble.

Unlike most, they just rest in your ear without a traditional earbud, which is great for keeping you aware of your surroundings, but rubbish for blocking out the commute. The stalks hang down, which can clash with some earrings.

Take one or other out of your ear and music pauses. Double tap to trigger Siri on an iPhone or skip track. There’s no volume control, which is annoying, and controls options are limited on non-Apple devices.

They last about five hours and charge five times from the battery in the small, pocket-friendly case, which is the best in the business.

The latest second-generation AirPods add always-on “Hey Siri” support, and the option of a wireless charging case for an extra £40. The smart money is on the regular £159 AirPods or first-generation models. Just watch out for fakes, which are numerous and dirt cheap.

The best non-isolating wireless earbuds by some margin, particularly for the iPhone.

If size is your primary concern, then the Earin M-2 are the winners. These tiny buds sit right in your concha with only a touchpad surface visible from the outside.

Taps take care of playback controls, but there’s no volume adjustment on the earbuds. Unusually there is no left or right earbud. Instead they work out which way around they are when you put them in. Either earbud can be used independently, too.

Connectivity to the phone and between the earbuds was rock solid, supporting SBC, AAC and the higher quality aptX (with compatible phone), with no lipsync issues. Call quality was good but a little quiet, and there’s no sidetone, which makes it very hard to know how loudly you are talking with both buds in.

They come with a variety of tips that block out noise fairly well, but there’s an ambient sound mode if you need it, which makes the world sound a little like you’re listening down a really old phone line. Odd but workable.

The Earins make a good show of most music genres, producing a balanced, relatively flat sound with good treble and fairly crisp highs. Those looking for pumping bass or truly sparkling audio are better served elsewhere.

They last three hours with three full charges in a slim but long aluminium case, which isn’t quite as pocketable as the best. An Android or iOS app handles updates and tweaks transparency settings.

The Earin M-2 are fairly difficult to get in the UK, with Earin’s own store about your only option. Their predecessors the M-1 are more commonly available, but they are not worth buying.

Pricey, tiny and pack a discreet latency-free punch, if you can find them.

Sennheiser has a long history of making excellent headphones, and the firm’s Momentum True Wireless are no exception. These are the best-sounding true wireless earbuds to date, producing rich, sparkling audio with crisp highs and deep bass.

The earbuds also block out noise fairly well, and have an ambient sound setting should you want a bit more awareness.

They’re shaped like a fez with an earbud on one end, and are fairly large as earbuds go. They will sit either inside your concha if your ears are big enough or float just outside staying put with the right tip. The top surface is touch sensitive taking care of playback and volume controls through various taps. Take out an earbud and the music pauses. It’s difficult to put them in without pushing a button, though.

Connectivity is excellent both to the phone and between the buds, supporting SBC, AAC, aptX and aptX Low Latency, which makes them excellent for all kinds of media and games with no latency or lipsync issues.

They last over three hours and can be charged three times in the fairly compact case, which is charged via USB-C. It’s not small enough to be comfortably pocketable, but it’s close. The biggest problem is the price, but at least you get what you pay for.

Expensive, but these are some of the best-sounding earbuds available with great connectivity.

Bluetooth earbuds: what you need to know

True wireless earbuds are great, but have some unique challenges which you should bear in mind.

You are paying a premium for not dealing with wires, which means pound-for-pound most true wireless earbuds won’t sound as good as wired versions.

The case is super-important for two reasons: it charges your earbuds, but also keeps them safe because these expensive buds are easy to lose. A good compact case you can fit in your pocket is essential.

Along with sheer connectivity strength, Bluetooth audio codec support is critical. A codec is the system used to transmit your audio over the Bluetooth connection. Older codecs are poor-quality and slow, which introduces lipsync issues because of high latency. There’s nothing more annoying than the audio not matching up with video. Look for at least AAC.

The iPhone only supports SBC and AAC at the moment, not the newer or higher-quality aptX or LDAC codecs. Those earbuds that support other codecs are less likely to suffer latency issues.

77,Opinion,Mark Zuckerberg has to go. Here are 25 reasons why | Evan Greer,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/08/mark-zuckerberg-has-to-go,2019-05-08T14:30:16Z,"Everyone wants there to be a silver bullet. A single policy solution that will “fix” Facebook, restore our privacy, and clean up the tech industry. There isn’t one.

Hefty fines, civil rights audits, antitrust, data privacy legislation, shareholder activism and employee organizing can all play a role. But we don’t just need regulation, we need a revolution – a massive cultural shift in how we think about our personal information and the companies that profit by collecting it.

In this gilded age of big tech, Silicon Valley’s royal families have sat in their castles, amassing treasure mined from a mountain of our data, seemingly untouchable as they weather scandal after scandal while they offer empty apologies and their power grows.

It’s time we prove that these kings are not gods. It’s time we dethrone Mark Zuckerberg.

What better way to draw a line in the sand and demand real change? What better way to strike fear in the hearts of the tech industry’s oligarchs, and make it clear that internet users will no longer tolerate a status quo where our data is harvested and used to manipulate us and invade our most private moments.

Under Mark Zuckerberg’s failed leadership, Facebook has become one of the most loathed institutions on the planet. The company was just slapped with a record breaking fine. Experts predict its profits will drop for the first time in years.

Mark Zuckerberg has had a decade’s worth of second chances to address the underlying disease, but he has shown time and time again he has no real intention of doing so. Need another reason he should step down? Here’s 25:
• None Security breach: A breach of Facebook’s computer systems left the personal information of 30 million users exposed – searches, locations, names, phone numbers, and more. It was the largest breach in the company’s history.
• None Unencrypted passwords: Hundreds of millions of Facebook and Instagram users had their passwords stored in plain text for years, some going back to 2012. Passwords were unencrypted and easily searchable by Facebook employees.
• None Two-factor phone numbers used for ads: Phone numbers given to Facebook for increased security via two-factor authentication were repurposed for targeted ads by the company. To opt out, users would have to turn off phone number-based two-factor authentication.
• None Psychological experimentation: Facebook admitted it ran experiments on hundreds of thousands of users to test how emotions spread on the site. Users, uninformed, had their news feeds manipulated by Facebook researchers to see more negative or positive posts to study whether users reacted by posting more negative or positive content.
• None Patriot Act hire: This month, Facebook hired Jennifer Newstead as its new general counsel, a Trump-appointed lawyer who co-wrote the Patriot Act, the Bush-era law that allowed for warrantless wiretapping among other government mass surveillance abuses. Facebook praised the hire.
• None Racist ads: Facebook allowed users to purchase ads targeted towards racist interests like “Jew hater” or “Nazi Party”, profiting from the sale of ads to users with those interests.
• None Facebook allowed employers to exclude women from ads: Facebook allowed employers to target ads exclusively to men, violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes discrimination based on sex illegal.
• None Secretly lobbying for surveillance expanding the “cybersecurity” bill Cisa, while claiming they weren’t.
• None Lobbying against privacy legislation in California and federally: Despite Zuckerberg’s opinion piece in the Washington Post publicly calling for privacy regulation, Facebook’s public policy team lobbied to prevent such legislation from passing in California.
• None Tracking non-users: If a website embeds Facebook features like the “like” button even if the visitor doesn’t have a Facebook account, Facebook is tracking you and shares your demographic data with advertisers.
• None Data deals with device makers: Facebook gave preferential access to user information to over 60 device makers, like Apple and Samsung. These deals are currently under criminal investigation by federal prosecutors.
• None Smear consultants: In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, instead of working substantively on internal reforms, Facebook’s policy team went on an aggressive public relations campaign, hiring a right-leaning public affairs group to smear, among others, the left-leaning billionaire George Soros.
• None Mark Zuckerberg discussed selling user data, even after claiming that he wouldn’t, and used Facebook’s data trove to “punish rivals and help friends”.
• None Recording call logs of Android users: Facebook got caught collecting SMS and call metadata from users of their app on Android phones, sweeping up names, phone numbers, and the lengths of each call made or received.
• None Onavo spying: Facebook for years used an app called Onavo to learn how long users spent on competing apps and what websites they visited, using this information to for instance buy WhatsApp for $19bn. Ultimately, Apple booted Onavo out of the app store.
• None Lax privacy exposed 6 million accounts. A White Hat hacker in 2013 found a bug exposing the email addresses and phone numbers of 6 million Facebook users to anyone who had some connection to the person or knew at least one piece of their contact information.
• None Beacon: One of Facebook’s early advertising programs, Beacon, automatically notified friends when users bought something, without obtaining prior consent. Zuckerberg ended up apologizing and giving users the option to opt out.
• None A bug exposed photos from 6.8 million users. The bug allowed third-party developers the ability to access users’ photos, including those that had been uploaded to Facebook’s servers but not publicly shared on any of its services
• None Manufacturing user consent: In 2010 while rolling out granular privacy control features, Facebook baked in a new default that resulted in users sharing updates publicly. The new feature pushed users to share their status as well as pictures publicly (by default) instead of sharing with friends only. By 2011, Facebook would be forced to sign settlements with the FTC and the European Union’s privacy office promising not to change users’ privacy settings without proper notice and opt-in, and Zuckerberg was forced to apologize.
• None Tracking unposted content: Back in 2013, a study revealed that Facebook was tracking metadata on statuses and posts even if users decided not to submit those posts.
• None Deleting Palestinian accounts: Facebook admitted in 2016 that it was following the direction of the American and Israeli governments and deleting accounts of Palestinians for “incitement” – a standard it did not hold for accounts from other nationalities.
• None Special access for tech giants: Facebook gave certain business partners like Amazon and Netflix preferential access to user data, allowing the tech giants to skirt the company’s usual privacy rules in order to grow its user base and attract more advertising revenue.
• None Enlisting Koch-funded climate deniers as factcheckers in their effort to combat “fake news”.
• None Shutting down activist pages: In its zeal to combat Russian trolls on its site, Facebook accidentally shut down the page of a grassroots activist group in Washington DC as it planned a counter-protest to a white nationalist rally in the capital.
• None Sharing user data with advertisers: A privacy loophole discovered in 2010 allowed advertisers to gain access to individual users’ information, like names, ages, hometowns and jobs. Facebook shut down the loophole quickly after being exposed.

Each revelation in this long and fraught list has been followed by promises, cosmetic fixes and apology tours. But Zuckerberg personally, and the ruling caste at Facebook generally, has shown no appetite for real reform – despite what they say on TV or in front of Congress.

Facebook’s current business model is fundamentally at odds with democracy and basic human rights. A company that claims to bring people together has been poisoned by a maniacal focus on mass collection of user data to satisfy advertisers. Hundreds of millions have had their privacy violated and their trust betrayed.

Enough is enough. Mark Zuckerberg must go. For the longest time we’ve accepted as scripture that Silicon Valley founders had a divine right to lead the most powerful companies ever created. We need to burst this cultish idea. Shareholders realize the problem is at the top. They’re lining up to Vote “No on Zuckerberg” at the upcoming AGM. However, Zuckerberg has structured the company so that he has more voting power than all other shareholders combined. It’s clear we need more than shareholders to make this happen. We need an internet-wide vote of no confidence. Zuckerberg’s resignation would send a message to tech workers, government regulators, advocates, and all who hold Silicon Valley accountable that leadership at these companies is a privilege, not a right.

“I know that we don’t exactly have the strongest reputation on privacy right now, to put it lightly,” Zuckerberg quipped at the recent F8 developers conference, forcing a guffaw. The audience was silent. Not even a chuckle. We’re not laughing any more, Mark. And we’re coming for your throne.

78,Technology,Google launches cheaper Pixel 3a smartphones,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/07/google-launches-cheaper-pixel-3a-smartphones,2019-05-07T19:00:09Z,"Google is looking to buck the £1,000-plus smartphone trend by launching a cheaper Pixel 3a smartphone that still offers its top-spec camera and software.

Announced at Google’s I/O developer conference in California on Tuesday, the new Pixel 3a and 3a XL Android phones are aimed at the increasingly important mid-range market. Starting at £399, they seek to offer most of what made Google’s £739-plus flagship phones good, but at a significantly reduced cost.

The two phones, which have 5.6in or 6in OLED screens respectively, eschew Google’s glass back design for plastic, but keep its rounded shape, fingerprint scanner, primary software and built-in artificial intelligence features.

Google cut its fan-favourite Nexus line of smartphones and exited the mid-range market with the launch of its first Pixel smartphones in 2016, which cost at least £599 and were designed to take on Apple’s dominant iPhone. But it recently admitted its latest Pixel 3 line had underperformed.

However, in the mid-range market Google hopes it can leverage its software prowess to offer something more appealing than Samsung’s mid-range A series and phones from Chinese rivals such as Huawei’s Honor.

Part of that offering is Google’s well-respected camera, which has been pulled straight from the Pixel 3 with all bells and whistles attached, including the night sight and top shot features.

But perhaps most appealing to more price-conscious consumers might be Google’s commitment to at least three years of monthly security updates and Android version upgrades, which have been a standout feature of its top-end smartphones and is something others do not offer at this price point.

Google’s baked-in AI, including squeezable sides that trigger Google Assistant and on-device music recognition, are also present in the Pixel 3a series.

Both phones come with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, but have Qualcomm’s mid-range Snapdragon 670 processor and are not water-resistant. They also lack wireless charging, but do have fast charging via USB-C and up to 30 hours of battery, according to Google. They also have a traditional headphone socket, something Google’s more expensive phones lack.

Whether the Pixel 3a’s combination of lower specifications but better software and camera is appealing enough to make a dent in the highly competitive mid-range market remains to be seen.

“Google has yet to deliver meaningful volume in smartphones and move Pixel beyond an innovation showcase,” said Geoff Blaber, VP Research, Americas at analyst firm CCS Insight. “Pixel 3A is a more assertive step into a more affordable segment and crucially, is supported by far wider channel distribution. This is a major ‘reset’ on its Pixel strategy.”

The Pixel 3a and 3a XL come in three colours and are available to order from Tuesday, costing £399 and £469 respectively.

79,Money,Currys' mix-up over TV delivery cost me time and effort,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/may/06/currys-mixup-over-tv-delivery-cost-me-time-and-effort,2019-05-06T06:00:13Z,"Back in December I purchased a Samsung smart TV from the Currys website. It arrived promptly and I was happy with it. However, a few days later a JVC TV was also delivered to me. It was clearly meant for someone else. I contacted Currys and after some time they arranged for the item to be collected, but then, bizarrely, issued me a refund for the Samsung that I ordered and was keeping.

Once again I contacted Currys, but try as I might, I cannot get this resolved due to issues with its payment system, poor customer service and incompetence. It has even sent me a slightly threatening letter asking me to call it but when I try to pay using my American Express card (the card used for the original online payment) it won’t accept it. I have wasted a lot of time and effort attempting to solve a mistake that is Currys’. Can you end this crazy situation?

Aargh, you have to love Currys’ post-purchase customer service. While it has never set the bar particularly high, your letter was something of a new low given that you were trying to do the right thing and give the store your money. Happily a call to head office got the matter quickly resolved. Your payment has now been taken via your Amex and they have reduced it by £50 to say sorry for all the hassle.

81,Technology,Spotify reaches 100m paying subscribers worldwide,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/29/spotify-paying-subscribers-streaming-us-canada,2019-04-29T14:08:22Z,"Spotify has reached 100 million paying subscribers, in a landmark for the music streaming service as it faces competition from major tech firms.

The number of users willing to pay for the service soared 32% in the first three months of 2019 compared with a year earlier, Spotify said on Monday.

The Swedish company, which listed on the New York Stock Exchange just over a year ago, said it was bolstered by a better-than-expected performance in North America, its second biggest market.

Spotify is in the middle of a battle for market share with music streaming competitors with deep pockets, including Google’s Play Music, YouTube Music, Amazon and Tidal, the service owned by Jay-Z, Beyoncé and other stars. Last month, Spotify filed a complaint against Apple with European regulators, alleging that the US tech firm limits choice and competition in its app store, giving its own music streaming service an unfair advantage over rivals.

The Swedish company, whose market value of about $25bn (£19bn) makes it one of Europe’s few large tech successes, has invested heavily in acquiring new users.

In March it agreed a deal with Samsung, the world’s largest phone producer, to pre-install its app on devices. Spotify has also gained 2 million users in India after launching there in February.

Free users, who listen to adverts between songs, still outnumbered paying subscribers at the end of the quarter, but the premium tier provides more than 90% of Spotify’s earnings.

In total, Spotify rang up revenues of €1.5bn (£1.3bn) in the first three months of the year, an increase of a third year on year. However, despite the increasing revenues, Spotify swung back into the red, with an operating loss of €47m for the quarter – after making a profit of €94m in the final three months of 2018.

India is one of the fastest-growing music markets and Spotify launched with an ad-supported option and a $1.67 monthly subscription, the cheapest rate offered by the music streaming servicein the 79 countries where it operates. Spotify charges $9.99 in the US and £9.99 in the UK.

On Monday, the company said more than one million users in India had signed up in its launch week and that figure had now more than doubled.

Observers highlighted the importance of the Indian market. Nicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “With customers outside Europe and the Americas accounting for just 10% of subscribers, the potential in cracking such a populous and potentially high-growth country would be huge.

“With rivals of the calibre of Amazon and Apple, Spotify can’t afford to rest on its laurels, but so far the group seems to be more than capable of holding its own.”

However, Spotify is about to lose 120,000 songs from Indian artists and Bollywood film soundtracks after failed negotiations with Saregama India, India’s oldest record label, whose catalogue generates more than 1bn streams worldwide each quarter.

So far this year Spotify has spent more than $300m buying three podcast firms: the true crime podcast maker Parcast; Gimlet, the firm behind Homecoming, which was made into an Amazon TV series starring Julia Roberts; and the podcast platform Anchor. Spotify says it plans to spend up to $500m in total this year outside music streaming.

The company’s founder, Daniel Ek, believes that in the future up to 20% of all listening on the service will be non-music content. It is also a strategy to help move away from the dependence on music licensing deals, which are low-margin with the majority of revenues paid out in royalties to music companies.

The streaming revolution has helped the beleaguered music industry to get back on its feet after years of digital piracy, and the continuing demise of the CD.

In 2018, global music revenues grew at the fastest rate in more than two decades to $19.1bn, the highest level of income since 2006, when CD sales accounted for more than 80% of its worldwide revenues.

Music streaming services generated more than half of the income earned by record labels in the UK for the first time last year.",0.9112,
82,Society,Rape cases ‘could fail’ if victims refuse to give police access to phones,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/29/new-police-disclosure-consent-forms-could-free-rape-suspects,2019-04-29T06:49:59Z,"Victims of rape and serious sexual assault who refuse to give police access to their mobile phone contents could allow suspects to avoid charges, two top officials have said.

New national consent forms authorising detectives to search texts, images and call data are proving controversial, Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Nick Ephgrave has admitted, as the difficulties of disclosure in the digital age risk pitting the pursuit of justice against preserving privacy.

And the director of public prosecutions, Max Hill, who has been DPP since last November, said: “You can end up in an extreme case where there’s there’s outright refusal [by a complainant] to allow access [to mobile phone contents] … and that can have consequences for our ability to pursue a prosecution.

“We are not interested in someone’s mobile device just because they have one … It’s [about] having a conversation to take them through [the process] if there’s material on a device which forms a reasonable line of inquiry. There are some pretty hard and fast rules about the circumstances in which private information ends up in the hands of a public court.”

Everyone, he said, needs to understand that if they get caught up in a crime, whether as witness or complainant, there may be information on their mobiles that is relevant.

In a briefing aimed at explaining the dilemmas faced by officers and prosecutors, Hill and Ephgrave called for people to have “trust and confidence” in the criminal justice system if investigators are to reverse recent sharp falls in prosecution rates.

Last year the number of rape charges fell by 23%, to its lowest level in a decade, following the collapse of a series of trials in late 2017 due to problems of disclosure. Defence lawyers accused police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) of failing to hand over crucial evidence that would have exonerated their clients. The setbacks have forced detectives and prosecutors to take more time and care handling cases – consequently reducing the throughput.

Around 93,000 police officers and staff have been undergone disclosure training in the past year to ensure they appreciate that providing the defence with timely access to relevant evidence is obligatory, Mike Cunningham, chief executive of the College of Policing, revealed.

The underlying problem is the volume of text, video and call records now available in even routine cases, particularly in domestic abuse or sexual assault allegations involving people who already know each other.

If the contents of an average Samsung S8 mobile were printed out, for example, Ephgrave said, it would produce millions of A4 sheets. Police are currently piloting three artifical intelligence schemes to ease the burden on officers reviewing records.

“There has not been a consistent way we have explained to victims, complainants and witnesses why we want to look [at the contents] and what we will do with [the material],” Ephgrave said. “There’s no piece of legislation that gives us power to seize a digital device from complainants and witnesses. We have to rely on their consent and that consent has to be revocable.”

Police have therefore developed a national consent form that explains why officers need to understand what is in a phone and why it may be necessary for material to be disclosed.

Complainants “have the opportunity to say I don’t wish that to happen but we also have to make it clear that if that’s the position then it may not be possible for the case to proceed”, Ephgrave said.

“[The forms] have not been welcomed by everyone. Some fear it may be putting people off reporting crime and that it’s too heavy handed.” The consent forms, in his view, however, are a “good start” although “not the finished article”.

Any communication between complainant and suspect is deemed to be a “reasonable line of enquiry”. If complainants refuse access that will be “disclosable and the CPS will have to take a view about whether or not the case can proceed”.

Responding to the briefing, Rachel Krys, co-director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: “We have an extremely serious problem with prosecuting rape in this country and it is a fact that most rapists get away with it. Part of the reason for this is investigations too often focus on women’s character, honesty and sexual history, despite rules which are supposed to prevent this, instead of the actions and behaviour of the person accused.

“If the new national consent form that victims will be asked to sign gives the police complete access to a woman’s entire personal records, phones, computers, etc – which may include thousands of personal and private conversations and images – these prejudices and barriers are being reinforced.”

Katie Russell, national spokeswoman for Rape Crisis England and Wales, said: “The new form offers victims and survivors more clarity about evidence disclosure processes and how their data will be used. The gathering and storage of disproportionate volumes of complainants’ data, and lack of consistency and clarity around how the relevance of evidence is determined and by whom remains a real concern.”

But Liam Allen, whose trial for rape was abandoned after police were ordered to hand over phone records that should have already been provided to the defence, welcomed the move as a “good start”.

Speaking to BBC Breakfast he said: “I understand there are reservations .... But considering my case ... it was that the evidence was on the complainant’s phone [that was] so much more valuable than people realise. It can be so much more valuable to prosecution cases as well as defence cases. It is a good step in the right direction.”

Griff Ferris, legal and policy officer at Big Brother Watch, which has obtained copies of the police consent forms through freedom of information requests, said: “These excessive digital trawls set an alarming precedent for the criminal justice system. Urgent reform is necessary so victims no longer have to sacrifice their private lives to bring criminals to justice. Treating rape victims like suspects in this way delays investigations and trials, prolongs distress for both victims and suspects and deters victims from reporting and obstructs justice.”

83,Australia news,Malcolm Turnbull says he urged Trump to develop 5G mobile networks,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/26/malcolm-turnbull-says-he-urged-trump-to-develop-5g-mobile-networks,2019-04-25T23:21:42Z,"Malcolm Turnbull has revealed that he encouraged Donald Trump to “take the lead” and develop 5G networks in cooperation with allies, including Australia, to hold out “ferocious competition” from China and to safeguard networks against cyber-attacks.

In a speech in New York overnight, the former prime minister said that in response to concerns China was stealing a technological march he had urged the US president to “ensure that we had at least one viable and secure 5G vendor from the United States and/or its Five Eyes partners”.

“It is, frankly, absurd that in this, arguably the most important enabling technology of our time, the United States and its closest allies like Australia are not leading players,” Turnbull said.

He had been pleased to see Trump announce this month that “that 5G is now a priority for his government to ensure US companies got up to speed”.

In the past countries in the west had been able to keep “high-risk” vendors from providing core equipment or capabilities, leaving them supplying services at the edge of the network rather than its core.

“But with 5G we have had to recognise that core/edge distinction no longer exists,” he said. “Right now a mobile network operator, like AT&T or Verizon, has just four full-service vendors from which to choose for its 5G network equipment. Two are from China (Huawei and ZTE) and two are from Scandinavia (Nokia and and Ericsson).

“Ferocious competition from the Chinese vendors on price and an absence of mind in Washington and other Five Eyes capitals has got us to the position where, when network security is more important than ever, there is not one 5G vendor from the United States or its Five Eyes allies.

“Indeed, there isn’t one from Japan, either, and the closest new prospect is Samsung of Korea.”

Turnbull revisited one of the last decisions he took as prime minister before being deposed by colleagues last August. He said cabinet’s national security committee had banned high-risk vendors from Australian 5G networks. That decision was taken amid the leadership tensions that culminated in the conservative-led move against him.

The exclusion angered the Chinese government. “The Australian government has made the wrong decision and it will have a negative impact to the business interests of China and Australia companies,” its commerce ministry said.

Turnbull said the committee’s definition of high risk was firms that “could be subject to directions from foreign intelligence services to act contrary to our national security”.

“The Chinese National Intelligence Law of 2017 makes it abundantly clear that Huawei and ZTE are subject to such obligations and accordingly they were excluded from the 5G rollout in Australia,” he said. Australia had been the first nation to impose a ban and “our decision was not taken lightly”.

He had asked Australia’s intelligence agencies to investigate how the risks could be mitigated to allow participation from Chinese companies. “After that very intense research and investigation, their unequivocal advice was that mitigation was not effectively possible.

“The decision was not a judgment on present or near-term threats but, as is more often the case, a long-term prudent hedge. Remember, threat is the combination of capability and intent. The former can take years or even decades to put in place, intent, on the other hand, can change in a heartbeat.”

Turnbull said he had formed a view that a nation like Australia “surrounded by friends, particularly well-armed ones, would be unwise to allow that neighbourly warmth to lead it to neglect its own defences”.

In an Anzac Day speech to the Australian American Veterans Scholarship Fund in New York, Turnbull did not address rising tensions in the South China Sea or the rapid build-up of naval power in the Asia-Pacific region but zeroed in on cyber-threats.

“Fleets and armies are tangible – and menacing – examples of coercive power but their usefulness is largely as a deterrent,” Turnbull said. “Once deployed in combat, the consequences are costly and hard to control or calibrate.

“However, cyber-warfare is very different. There the cost of interference is much lower, and state actors do not by any means have the arena to themselves.

“It is very hard to deny the origin of a missile, but cyber-attacks are notoriously hard to attribute – and that is assuming you know it is going on in the first place.

“In other words the cybersphere offers opponents the ability to inflict damage at relatively low cost to themselves, with a high degree of deniability and relatively little prospect of effective retaliation.”",0.044,
84,World news,Scott Morrison says reports of Isis plot to target Anzac Day Gallipoli events 'inconclusive',https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/24/isis-suspect-arrested-in-turkey-over-alleged-gallipoli-plot,2019-04-25T02:27:37Z,"The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has cast doubt on a possible plot to target Anzac Day commemorations at Gallipoli despite the arrest of a man with suspected links to Islamic State by Turkish police.

The suspect, a Syrian national, was arrested after a police operation in Osmaniye and was among several Isis members detained.

Turkish police allege the suspect, named in the charge sheet as 25-year-old Abdul Karim Helif, was planning the attack as retaliation for the mass shooting in March at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Two sim cards, one in a Samsung phone, are central to the case against him.

Morrison has confirmed the Gallipoli memorial service on Thursday will go ahead as planned. He has spoken to Australia’s chief of defence force, Angus Campbell, on the phone, who is on the ground and will address the ceremony.

“The reports that we are receiving are inconclusive about any link between that arrest and any possible planned event at Gallipoli itself,” Morrison told reporters in Townsville on Thursday. “In fact to make that assumption would be, I think, making a very big assumption.”

He noted the arrest had taken place three hours away from where the Gallipoli memorial service is held.

“It is fairly routine for Turkish authorities to arrest people with suspected terrorist links,” Morrison said.

Asked if security had been beefed up, Morrison said normal arrangements were in place.

Turkish police assessed the threat to be serious but gave no details about the nature of the proposed attack.

Australians and New Zealanders travel to Turkey each year for memorial services commemorating the failed 1915 military campaign by Anzac (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) and allied forces to drive Ottoman troops from Gallipoli and the Dardanelles region.

Soldiers from New Zealand, Australia, Turkey and other countries held services on the peninsula on Wednesday. At dawn on Thursday, Australians and New Zealanders were due to hold a special dawn service marking the landings.

The commemorations come a month after the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, faced criticism from Australia and New Zealand for comments he made after the Christchurch shooting that invoked Gallipoli.

Turkey has said Isis was responsible for bombings in 2015 and 2016 in which 200 people died. Although the militant group has not been active recently in the country, authorities still carry out routine operations against suspected Isis members.

The Australian veterans affairs minister, Darren Chester, said the arrest was primarily a matter for Turkish authorities.

“We work closely with the local Turkish authorities on security arrangements,” he told ABC Radio National on Thursday. “Obviously the tragic events in Christchurch had nothing to do with the events of 1915 on the peninsula and there’s a great deal of respect between the Turkish people and Australian and New Zealanders.”

The Australian War Memorial director, Brendan Nelson, praised Turkish authorities for dealing with the issue.

“The Turkish authorities went to extraordinary lengths to see that the Gallipoli peninsula was secure for the Anzac Day services that are being held there.”

Turkish nationals were banned from attending the dawn service amid heightened security fears.

“Unfortunately we live in a world where there are people – wherever they live, whatever their background, whatever their beliefs – who are fundamentalists intent on disrupting what we do,” Nelson said. “The most important thing we can do is go about living our lives.”",-0.9434,
85,Technology,"Huawei P30 Pro review: game-changing camera, stellar battery life",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/24/huawei-p30-pro-review-leica-quad-camera-zoom,2019-04-24T06:00:26Z,"Huawei’s latest top-end phone, the P30 Pro, has a genuinely groundbreaking new quad camera system on the back with amazing low-light performance and the first 5x optical zoom enabling a practically spycam-like 50x digital zoom.

The new £900 phone, from the firm that continues to be at the centre of a political storm, has the familiar metal frame, curved glass and all-screen design of 2018-19. New for the P30 Pro are some stunning colour options, including the pearlescent oil slick-like “breathing crystal” and the eye-popping amber sunrise. If you want a phone that gloriously embraces colour, this is it.

Stretching 6.47in from corner to corner, with a small tear-drop notch at the top, the FHD+ OLED is massive and beautiful, only beaten out by Samsung’s high resolution stunner on the Galaxy S10+.

Build quality is exceptional. The glass back is slippery on fabric, but OK in the hand, even if it is a fingerprint magnet. A clear plastic case is included in the box in most regions.

There’s no earpiece speaker. Instead the whole screen vibrates to produce your call audio, which is indistinguishable from a regular speaker. Despite the phone’s huge screen, the P30 Pro is still fairly manageable thanks to its narrow width.

At 73.4mm wide, it is narrower than all of the similarly-sized competition, including the 77.4mm wide iPhone XS Max and 74.1mm Samsung Galaxy S10+, even if it is a smidgen wider than the 72.3mm Mate 20 Pro. The P30 Pro weighs 192g, though, which puts it on the heavy side, only surpassed by the 208g iPhone XS Max.
• None Connectivity: LTE, Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth 5 and GPS (dual-sim available in some regions)

The guts of the P30 Pro are identical to the Mate 20 Pro: Huawei’s own Kirin 980 processor and 8GB of RAM. As such performance was identical. Snappy, fast and smooth all over, including in long gaming sessions. It easily kept up with the best of the rest.

Huawei has made a name for itself with long battery life and it continues to stand head and shoulders above the rest.

With heavy usage it lasted just under 35 hours between charges, meaning it would make it all the way from 7am on day one until 6pm on day two. That was as my primary device with the usual deluge of email, messages and push notifications, lots of browsing, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, watching 90 minutes of offline movies, 30 minutes of gaming and shooting about 20 photos a day.

Even when used as a primary navigation aid and camera on holiday, it never once got below 15% by midnight. With lighter usage the P30 Pro should manage 48 hours between charges, or far longer with one of the specialised power-saving modes active.

A full charge took less than an hour, reaching 70% in just over 30 minutes via cable. It also has fast 15W wireless charging and wireless power sharing for charging some other Qi-compatible devices.

The P30 Pro runs Huawei’s latest version of EMUI 9.1, which is the company’s version of Android 9 Pie. It looks and behaves almost identically to EMUI 9 on the Mate 20 Pro.

EMUI 9.1 has slightly refined gesture navigation options, which work very well, swiping in from either left or right side of the screen for back, up from the centre of the bottom of the screen for home, or up and hold for recently used apps. Swipe up from the bottom left or right to activate Google Assistant. The only thing missing is a quick way to get immediately back to the previously used app, as double-tapping the old overview button did. The traditional three-button navigation bar is available if you don’t like gestures and there are many other customisation options including full theme support.

EMUI’s strengths are long-term performance and battery life, with extensive automatic and manual suppression systems that stop apps draining battery in the background. Occasionally that means you miss notifications, but EMUI is getting better at alleviating the problem and a little tweaking of the per-app power saving settings can make sure your WhatsApps or Guardian push notifications get through.

Overall, Huawei is making gradual improvements, giving a fairly refined experience, but it still lags behind Google, OnePlus or Samsung in look and feel for a western audience. The speed of updates is also not the best in the industry.

In-screen fingerprint scanners are all the rage at the moment as they free-up space on the device while keeping them in a convenient position on the front. The P30 Pro has Huawei’s next iteration of its optical fingerprint scanner.

It’s faster, more accurate and easier to hit with muscle memory, being further down the screen than the Mate 20 Pro. It’s still not as fast nor secure as traditional capacitive fingerprint scanners, but I found it fast and reliable enough to use without looking, making it a worthwhile trade-off.

Large, meaningful steps forward in smartphone photography are fairly rare, but with the P30 Pro Huawei’s managed two of them in one device. The new Leica quad-camera system dramatically improves both zoom and low-light performance.

The 40-megapixel wide angle and 20-megapixel ultra-wide angle cameras are joined by a brand new 8-megapixel telephoto camera that uses a prism to direct light sideways into the body of the phone for a 5x optical zoom lens. The fourth camera is a 3D depth-sensing system called a time of flight (ToF) camera used for portrait effects and other bits.

The combination of cameras is truly outstanding. The ultra-wide angle camera is a lot of fun, producing some really interesting shots. But it is the 5x optical zoom that is unmatched by rivals, getting you far closer to your subject without using hybrid or digital zoom. Then there’s the up to 10x hybrid zoom on top, with uses the other cameras to fill in detail. In good light the differences between hybrid and the 5x optical zoom are small. If that wasn’t enough, you get a 50x digital zoom, which is visibly inferior to the optical and hybrid, but is still good enough to read text from quite some distance or spot people on a distant hilltop.

I used it as a surrogate for a pair of binoculars on several occasions to great effect. Getting to the various zoom levels is easy but holding a 50x zoom steady enough to keep your target in view takes a little practice.

The second big leap is in low-light photography. Using a new camera sensor system that ditches green for yellow pixels, Huawei has been able to dramatically improve light absorption and the results are miraculous. Ordinary point-and-shoot shots without using a dedicated night or long exposure mode can all but turn night into day illuminating full detail and colour in scenes where the human eye struggles.

Google managed a similar feat with its Night Sight mode, but that takes several seconds to take an image. The P30 Pro does better with an instant snap.

In terms of camera image quality, the results are equally impressive, matching or beating rivals in almost every scenario. Google’s Pixel still produces better detail and contrast in HDR images but only just. You can point and shoot the P30 Pro at almost anything and get a good image. Huawei’s Master AI system is also improved, but I never really felt the need to engage it – the images were mostly right without.

Even the 32-megapixel selfie camera in the small notch on the front of the device is great, capturing a good amount of detail and managing variable lightning conditions well despite being fixed-focus.

The Huawei P30 Pro has an RRP of £899.99 with 128GB of storage or £1,099.99 with 512GB.

For comparison, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro costs £729 with 128GB storage, the 128GB Samsung Galaxy S10+ costs £899, the 64GB Google Pixel 3 XL costs £719 with 64GB, the 64GB iPhone XS Max costs £1,099, 128GB Honor View20 costs £449 and the 64GB OnePlus 6T costs £499.

Huawei is no stranger to hyperbole, but not for the first time experience matches up to the claims. The P30 Pro genuinely marks a massive leap forward for smartphone cameras with game changing low-light performance and a remarkable new zoom technology.

Both make meaningful, useful additions to your photographic arsenal, giving the P30 Pro the best camera available. It’s flexible, powerful and above all, super-fun to use. Which surely is the point.

The rest of the phone is excellent, too, if not that dissimilar to the older Mate 20 Pro. Battery life remains competition-beating. It’s snappy, bright and beautiful, and even Huawei’s EMUI software is improving.

Despite being fairly narrow and therefore easier to handle than rivals with similar screen sizes, there’s no getting around the fact that the P30 Pro is a pretty large phone. Smaller hands will struggle.

At £900, the P30 Pro is certainly a premium smartphone. But if your priorities are performance, battery life and camera capability, the Huawei P30 Pro is the best phone you can buy right now and will take some beating.

Big tech would rather throw us a broken Samsung Galaxy Fold | Charles Arthur,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/24/big-tech-broken-samsung-galaxy-fold-phone,2019-04-24T05:00:16Z,"If you ever wondered whether the tech business is thrashing around in search of something – anything – to make people Buy More Unneeded Stuff, Samsung’s Galaxy Fold is all the proof you need. Heralded as the first phone that unfolds to become a tablet, or possibly the first tablet that folds up into a phone, its worldwide launch has now been delayed because the units sent to some reviewers broke.

In some cases, they peeled off a protective layer over the folding screen, thinking it was just a protective layer; but it turned out that it was actually Very Important, and Not To Be Removed. Others found their screen gave up or seemed to be cracking, which worried Samsung so much that it demanded the units back. Now the company is taking a few weeks while it figures out whether to go ahead and demand $2,000 (£1,500) for a phone that might break in a few days.

Samsung isn’t the only company that thinks folding screens are what we want; China’s Huawei also has one, except that folds in another direction. Fortunately for Huawei, however, it wasn’t planning to launch its foldable until autumn – by which time it might be able to pretend it was all a fever dream.

The trouble is, smartphone sales are in the doldrums, so we’re at the throw-ideas-at-the-wall stage of innovation. Other companies are adding cameras so quickly they’ll soon have an insect-style compound eye.

Samsung, of course, made itself famous in 2016 with the Note 7, a phone whose bonus feature was that it could burn your house down while you slept: the battery had been squashed in so tightly that it could overheat while charging. Samsung recalled the Note 7 not once but twice, in the process achieving the rare honour of being banned from all flights in the United States. You can almost smell the desperation in so many tech “advances”, which take the form either of adding things you didn’t need (the side button on Samsung phones is hardwired to its awful Bixby voice assistant) or taking away things you did (Apple removing phone headphone jacks so you need to buy, and lose, tiny plug-in dongles).

But really, are there no new boundaries to explore in technology other than phone-tablets? (And why is nobody calling the Fold a “phablet”, a word coined when phones started to grow to the size of bread slices?) Again and again, technology companies show a peculiar deafness to users’ desires. Facebook has the rare distinction of having been cited in a United Nations report on genocide, and was used by Russia to try to steer the US presidential election. So what’s it doing about that? Good news: political ads will in future have teeny-tiny labels you can click to find out who funded them. That’s going to fix it all!

It doesn’t end there, unfortunately. Anyone who has visited San Francisco, at the upper end of Silicon Valley, knows it desperately needs a solution to homelessness: which is why millions of dollars are being poured into scooter startups so that moneyed people can get away from them faster. Similarly, America’s health system is absurdly expensive, so tech companies have invented systems that let you scan a cheque and email the image rather than posting the thing, thus saving you the cost of a stamp.

Somewhere, it’s all gone a bit off-kilter. Stuff doesn’t break like it used to; phones now last years and years. Maybe it was inevitable that Samsung would invent the self-breaking phone. But it’s hard to say that’s progress.

First burials in Sri Lanka as death toll rises and arrests mount

Three minutes of silence were held across the south Asian island nation today in honour of those who were killed in Sunday’s bomb attacks against Christian worshippers and hotel guests, as the first burials took place with the country plunged into a state of mourning. The death toll now stands at more than 320 people – including three children of the billionaire fashion tycoon behind Asos – and there have been 40 arrests amid a state of emergency and the imposition of an overnight curfew.

The shocking rape trial that galvanised Spain’s feminists – and the far right

For many women across Spain, the “wolf pack” case – where five men were acquitted of rape on a legal technicality and found guilty of a lesser charge of “sexual abuse” – exposed a misogynist society, sparking widespread protests. An anti-feminist backlash ensued, Meaghan Beatley writes.

88,World news,Tuesday briefing: Sri Lanka plunged into mourning,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/23/tuesday-briefing-sri-lanka-plunged-into-mourning,2019-04-23T05:29:58Z,"Hello, Warren Murray back with you as we begin the day.

Sri Lanka remains on edge as it observes a national day of mourning, grieving the loss of at least 310 people killed in Easter Sunday’s bomb attacks on hotels and churches in Colombo, Negombo and Batticaloa.

The vast majority of those who lost their lives were Sri Lankan while it is thought as many as 40 foreign nationals may also have been killed. At least eight Britons are among the dead: those identified include lawyer Anita Nicholson, her son Alex, age 14, and daughter Annabel, 11; as well as Billy Harrop, an ex-firefighter from Greater Manchester, and his wife, Sally Bradley, a doctor and the sister of the Labour peer Lord Keith Bradley; and siblings Daniel and Amelie Linsey, aged 19 and 15, who were travelling with their father and escaped one explosion in a restaurant, only to be killed by a second blast.

The Sri Lankan authorities received warnings two weeks before the attacks, the government has admitted. An intelligence memo on 9 April named the radical Islamist group National Thowheeth Jama’ath as planning suicide bomb attacks on churches. Experts have questioned whether the newly formed group could have mounted an attack on this scale without outside help. The information from the memo was not passed to the prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and his cabinet, a government minister said. The president, Maithripala Sirisena, chairs the national security meetings where the memo was tabled, and he is bitterly at odds with Wickremesinghe.

A state of emergency has been put into effect. Sirisena is expected to meet with foreign diplomats to “to seek international assistance to combat terrorism”.

IRA dissidents admit to McKee killing – The New IRA has admitted its responsibility for the killing of Northern Ireland journalist Lyra McKee, 29, who was shot while observing rioting in the Creggan estate of Derry on Thursday night. Friends of McKee have smeared red handprints on the walls of the Derry offices of Saoradh – a party that reflects New IRA thinking, and has tried to portray McKee as an unfortunate bystander killed in a military conflict. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said Saoradh’s response to McKee’s death had been “beneath contempt”. Two men in their late teens were arrested over the killing and later released without charge. Police continue to appeal for witnesses and information.

Brexit plan still not hatched – Easter is over so talks between government ministers and Labour will resume today, against the background noise of Tory efforts to oust Theresa May from Downing Street over her handling of Brexit. Some of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers apparently want a June departure date, despite the PM being safe as leader for a year under party rules. There have been more revelations about faux-grassroots online campaigns that were overseen by Tory-aligned Lynton Crosby’s firm CTF Partners. Innocuous-sounding Facebook pages such as Small Business For Britain, Protecting British Heritage and Northern Industry were used to promote pro-Brexit messages to unwitting readers. There is speculation Crosby, a longtime confidant of Boris Johnson, may be positioning his company to benefit from placing the hard Brexiter in Downing Street.

‘Old-style asylums’ – A patient locked in a secure ward for more than 21 years is among hundreds of people with mental health problems being kept in what one MP has called “old-style asylums” in NHS hospitals. Using freedom of information the Guardian found that at least 435 patients spent time in locked rehabilitation wards in 2018 and some had been there for years. The wards started being used about 10 years ago, mainly provided by the private sector, to treat people considered a high risk to others. Critics say they put priority on confinement rather than patients’ recovery. The Care Quality Commission has previously said: “We do not consider that this model of care has a place in today’s mental healthcare system.” But an NHS spokesperson said that “in a tiny number of cases” it remains the safest and most appropriate treatment setting for the individual patient and wider community.

‘You can’t be a little bit sustainable’ – Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old founder of the school strike for climate movement, has backed the idea of a general strike to drive the cause forward. Speaking at an event in London, Thunberg gave her support to the city’s continued Extinction Rebellion protests: “We need to do everything we can to put pressure on the people in power.” Having already met the pope and addressed members of the EU parliament, Thunberg will today meet the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, and leaders of all the main parties including Jeremy Corbyn, but not Theresa May. Thunberg told last night’s event that her autism had worked in favour of her activism: “We are more likely to see through lies … You can’t be a little bit sustainable – either you are sustainable or you are not.”

Unfolding drama – Samsung has pulled the release of its Galaxy Fold smartphone because of its signature bendy screen breaking. Several journalists who were given trial units reported the inside screens flickering, freezing and finally dying within the first few days. The phones, which fold open to the size of a small tablet device, had been slated to go on the market this coming Friday but that has been put off while Samsung works out what to do.

Today in Focus podcast: Genesis of the ‘Green New Deal’

In 2007, over a friendly drink, the Guardian’s economics editor, Larry Elliott, came up with a radical plan to address the effects of the financial crisis and climate change. He called it the Green New Deal. Plus: the Guardian’s education correspondent on why schools are going to test four-year-olds.

Environmentalist and author Bill McKibben writes today that to stop global catastrophe, we must believe in ourselves as humans again. One pessismistic argument, he says, runs that the average person won’t do anything voluntarily about climate change, because it would reduce their standard of living by too much – so individual choice and technological solutions to cope with an overheated planet, going as far as editing our own DNA, should run their course instead. But “around the world, polling shows that people are not just highly concerned about global warming, but also willing to pay a price to solve it.

“Americans, for instance, said in 2017 that they were willing to see their energy bills rise 15% and have the money spent on clean energy programmes … The reason we don’t have a solution to climate change has less to do with the greed of the great unwashed than with the greed of the almost unbelievably small percentage of people at the top of the energy heap, corrupting the political debate with rolls of cash.”

Manchester United’s woes continue to stack up, with reports that three of their top stars may leave the club if they fail in their bid to secure a top four finish. One of those stars, Paul Pogba, who has previously been courted by Barcelona, admitted that players had disrespected the club in their 4-0 loss to Everton: “We didn’t respect ourselves, the club or the fans. Everything went wrong but the most important thing is the mentality that we put on the pitch, that has to change.”

Meanwhile the title race is heating up, with only two points separating Liverpool (88) from Manchester City (86). With the Premier League on the home straight, there is a scramble afoot to avoid relegation, while in the Women’s Super League, Arsenal and Manchester City have sealed Champions League places, with the Gunners looking to seal their first title since 2012. In cricket, Peter Siddle has called for Australia’s Steve Smith and David Warner to be cut some slack on their international return in the world cup, saying: “They weren’t the first people to ball-tamper and they’re probably not going to be the last.”

Asian shares were little changed on Tuesday, hovering not far from nine-month peaks hit last week. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was almost flat, while Japan’s Nikkei average eased 0.2%. Many markets around the world remained shut on Monday after the long Easter weekend. Sterling has been trading around $1.298 and €1.154 overnight while the FTSE looks like being down a tad at the open.

The Times leads with “Families destroyed by bombers” as it covers the Sri Lanka attacks. The Express focuses on Anita Nicholson and her two children whom it says were “Murdered at the breakfast table”, while the Mirror says the atrocity has left “A nation broken”. Sri Lanka’s own Daily Mirror runs a black front page with small type at the bottom saying: “In memory of those who lost their lives on 21.04.2019”.

“Sri Lanka given warning about blasts two weeks ago”, reports the Guardian. The FT has a similar top line for its front-page picture story, but its splash is a crackdown on bonuses at Barclays where activist investor Edward Bramston – who the Guardian says has been “compared to Mr Burns in The Simpsons” – is trying to force his way on to the board. The i tells us there is a “stop Boris campaign” under way among Tories to prevent him becoming leader in place of Theresa May.

The Daily Mail leads with how customers are “Secretly filmed as you shop” to manipulate them to spend more. It also joins the Express and Times in celebrating the first birthday of Prince Louis with a picture across the front. The Times runs with the outlawing of gag orders against NHS staff whistleblowers.

89,Technology,'Companies are seldom treated like this': how Huawei fought back,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/19/companies-are-seldom-treated-like-this-how-huawei-fought-back,2019-04-19T15:02:23Z,"A pillar box red electric train connects Paris, Verona and Grenada via Budapest’s Liberty Bridge and on to Heidelberg Castle in a 120-hectare fantasy business park dreamt up by the Chinese billionaire Ren Zhengfei.

Ren, 74, a former Red Army engineer who founded the telecommunications company Huawei in 1987 and still owns a 1.14% stake, asked the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma to recreate some of Europe’s most historic cities. He hoped to inspire an army of 25,000 research and development staff to challenge Apple, Google and Samsung.

While its US competitors keep their research facilities on lockdown to prevent corporate espionage (oft allegedly by the Chinese), Huawei is inviting the world’s media into its labs and factories in an attempt to dispel the US government’s claims that the privately held company is an arm of the Chinese state and that its technology could be used to hack into western governments.

US politicians allege that Huawei’s forthcoming 5G mobile phone networks could be hacked by Chinese spies to eavesdrop on sensitive phone calls, gain access to counter-terrorist operations – and potentially even kill targets by crashing driverless cars. Allies who allow Huawei technology inside their 5G networks have been warned that they may be frozen out of US intelligence sharing.

The US also ordered the arrest of Ren’s daughter Meng Wanzhou, who is also Huawei’s chief financial officer, over allegations that Huawei breached US sanctions on Iran.

Meng was detained in Vancouver, Canada, in December and remains under house arrest awaiting extradition to the US. Huawei vehemently denies the allegations and said it was another example of America’s political pressure tactics. Meng is suing Canada over the arrest.

“We have spent more than a decade trying hard to communicate with the US government and to prove what kind of company Huawei really is,” Catherine Chen, a Huawei board director and senior vice-president, told the Guardian in an interview at the company’s headquarters in another vast campus in nearby Shenzhen. “It’s time for the US government to present the evidence and facts that support their case.”

Chen, who has worked her way up through the ranks at Huawei over a 25-year career, said the company had tried to avoid a public spat with the the US but was ready for battle. “The US government is using a lot of their resources, and resorting to political and diplomatic means to speak ill of us,” she said. “They have interfered in our business operations. This is quite rare. Companies have seldom been treated like this.”

Huawei’s tactic is very un-Chinese: to invite dozens of members of the foreign media to tour previously secret offices and freely question senior executives. This week alone, the company spent hundreds of thousands of pounds paying for dozens of journalists to travel from across Europe, Australia, India, Africa and South America to a conference.

The new Donnguan campus, which cost yuan 10bn (£1.1bn), is vast: the equivalent of about 140 football pitches. A round trip on the train will take 22 minutes when all the 12 “towns” – including one based incongruously on Lake Windermere in the Lake District – are completed later this year. The complex will also include housing for several thousand workers, subsidised for up to eight years.

As the tram approaches the Heidelberg stop at noon, dozens of employees – most dressed similarly to Silicon Valley tech bros in jeans, logo T-shirts and hoodies – emerge from their desks inside the faux Heidelberger Schloss for lunch in one of 24 canteens (there are additional, fancier restaurants for special occasions).

On the menu at one of the canteens is tofu with noodles, sweet and sour pork for 10 yuan (£1.15), or today’s special: pig trotter soup for 12 yuan. Posters tempt staff with a glass of Mossel wine with their lunch for a few extra yuan, with the slogan in English and Mandarin: “Mossel or nothing”. The Huawei Mossel wine company is wholly owned by Huawei.

Huawei began the Mossel wine brand after the company took payment from an Argentinian customer in the form of wine and beef to avoid currency controls. Most of the wine from that deal has already been drunk, and a spokesman explained that the beef wasn’t in the form of real live cows.

“We did a deal with an Argentinian operator, where we took part payment in beef. We subsequently traded some of it and also offered some to staff to sell,” he said. The company has also accepted accepted payment in grain and other commodities as a result of controls on the yuan.

At a nearby smartphone factory, workers are dressed uniformly – white lab coat, black shoes and a cap in one of three colours: white for machine operators, pink for quality controllers and blue for technical engineers. Over recent years the number of white caps has drastically reduced as Huawei strives to reduce the number of low-skilled roles among its 188,000-strong workforce.

On the production line the Guardian visited this week, there are just 17 workers – compared with 86 six years ago – as robots and AI have replaced simpler tasks. One worker had himself replaced after suggesting to his bosses that a simple robot could do his job better than him, and he was promoted to a problem-solving unit. A team leader at the factory said workers are paid a minimum of 10,000 yuan (£1,150) a month, and claimed this was 50% more than those working in similar roles at Chinese rivals.

At the start of the production line, which is today making Huawei’s P20 smartphone, microchip components are fed into machines on long spools of tape and guided on to circuit boards by lasers and robots.

About 2,500 components are soldered on to circuit boards, joined by cameras, microphones, batteries and glass screens before emerging at the other end as a fully formed phone two and a half hours later.

Testing, which is also largely by robot, takes another 11.5 hours. Each production line spits out a new phone every 28.5 seconds. When all the lines are operational at the same time, the company makes a new phone every second.

Back in January, Apple was forced into its first warning for more than a decade of slowing sales, as a result of weak demand for its iPhones in the vast Chinese market.

Huawei, however, is growing fast. The success of its smartphones, which are considerably cheaper than Apple equivalents, helped Huawei to achieve a 20% jump in sales to a record 721bn yuan £82bn last year. Its profits soared 25% to 59bn yuan (£6.7bn).

That success has pushed Ren up the world’s rich list. According to Forbes, he is the 83rd richest in China, with a £1.7bn personal fortune.

90,Technology,Galaxy Fold: Samsung investigates as screens break in first days,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/18/galaxy-fold-samsung-investigates-as-screens-break-in-first-days,2019-04-18T10:29:41Z,"The screen at the heart of Samsung’s new Galaxy Fold phone, which literally folds in half, has been failing in testers’ hands within days, prompting concerns about the durability of the £1,800 device.

The company distributed the device to publications across the US on Monday before its release to the public on 26 April. But within two days testers were reporting that the all-important central flexible screen started to break under normal use.

Unlike traditional smartphones, which have screens covered in rigid protective glass, the Galaxy Fold has a flexible plastic layer, which can be replaced by Samsung to repair a screen scratch without having to replace the whole display.

Some of the devices failed because journalists testing them peeled off that crucial top layer leaving sensitive components of the new multilayer screen exposed – but other devices appear to have failed through normal use.

CNBC’s Todd Haselton, who did not peel off the film, found half the Galaxy Fold’s screen failed.

The device used by the Verge’s Dieter Bohn failed after a lump formed between the display and the hinge behind it, which is designed to support the articulation of the two halves of the phone.

In a statement, Samsung said: “A limited number of early Galaxy Fold samples were provided to media for review. We have received a few reports regarding the main display on the samples provided. We will thoroughly inspect these units in person to determine the cause of the matter.”

Samsung said the phone was durability tested to withstand being unfolded at least 200,000 times, or about 100 times a day for five years.

Other device testers have not reported the screens failing on their Galaxy Folds, but it is unclear how many of the phones have been distributed and therefore the failure rate of the devices.

The Galaxy Fold sold out of preorders in the US within days of going on sale, but will not ship or reach stores until 26 April. The phone, which will also come in a 5G variant, is planned to go on sale in the UK and other parts of Europe on 3 May, with preorders starting on 26 April.

Whether the devices shipped to customers will have the same issues as the preproduction versions given to testers remains to be seen. Samsung expects to produce 1m Galaxy Folds.

Sold as an ultra-premium device – $1,980 in the US, £1,800 in the UK and €2,000 in Europe – the Galaxy Fold comes with various accessories in the box, including a protective aramid case and Samsung’s Galaxy Buds truly wireless earphones. But it also comes with an insurance scheme called Samsung Care+, which covers repairs of the device for screen breakages or water damage. Unlike most other top-end smartphones, the Fold is not water-resistant.

Samsung’s last high-profile failure was the Galaxy Note 7, which had battery problems in 2016, causing the phone to explode and leading to two recalls and eventual shelving.

The South Korean multinational, which is the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer, will be anxious to avoid another extremely costly disaster.

Other companies, including China’s Huawei, are snapping at Samsung’s heels in pursuit of the new category of folding phones, with the Mate X expected to go on sale in the next 6 months.

92,Opinion,I ditched my iPhone and it changed my life | Charlotte Church,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/08/charlotte-church-ditched-iphone-saved-my-life,2019-04-08T07:00:42Z,"TS Eliot wrote of “faces / Distracted from distraction by distraction / Filled with fancies and empty of meaning / Tumid apathy with no concentration”. TS Eliot never had a smartphone.

Neither did I for a long time. No Facebook account; not even email. Like Eliot, I was a luddite, but a peculiar breed because, according to my date of manufacture, I’m supposed to be a digital native. Perhaps it’s because by the age of 20 I was up the duff in the Welsh countryside with baby brain, no signal and no wifi. I had no need for Myspace and such.

When I finally fell into the digital realm, I fell hard. Unlike my peers for whom social media and mobile technology were vines that had grown and flowered around them, for me it was a sudden immersion, as if I’d been dropped from the sky into the jungle. I got Facebook, Twitter and Gmail accounts at the same time that I got an iPhone 4, so as my world dramatically augmented it simultaneously shrank to the size of a Ryvita.

Giddy in the tumble-blur of LCD colours, my pleasure centre would light up like a pinball machine at a well-received tweet. I would check my phone; five minutes later I’d check my phone again. If someone somewhere wanted to pick a fight with me, or was going to tell a lie and try to drag my reality into their miserable shitty worldview, I couldn’t let it go, no matter how blatantly twattish the troll (not to be confused with my new children’s book Twattish the Troll; “He’s such a twat!” – David Walliams). I was secretly addicted as the anxiety carousel wheeled unwieldily. I couldn’t focus, not even on a single app on my phone before I was drawn to another, “distracted from distraction by distraction”.

It wasn’t just Twitter and emails I was monitoring with obsessive regularity: it was the weather, in places where I wasn’t; it was my menstrual cycle app; it was the ticket site SongKick. And when all that was exhausted: scroll, scroll, scroll. It started to affect my relationships with friends and family, especially as the colours of our politics became our only interactions.

The P-word aside, I still doubt I’ll ever be branded a moderate. One night, without a word, I ditched my iVampire and bought a Nokia 3310 in anaemic red, and became the talk of the town. My phone was the hottest conversation piece. The nostalgic: “OMG, does it have Snake!?” The hilarious: “No, Polly Pocket doesn’t live inside; no, I didn’t get it free with Girl Talk magazine.” The inevitable: “So, Charl, see you’ve started selling weed.” It made me look like a drug dealer, it didn’t have predictive text, but it was my new favourite retro-fashion accessory and I felt great about it.

And the withdrawal? For the first few weeks I had a constant clifftop sketchiness, as if I was supposed to be doing something and couldn’t put my finger on what. But that soon abated. I was still on Twitter, but it didn’t follow me around the whole day, so I stopped responding to arseholes and only posted about stuff I really cared about. Gradually, I became aware that not only had I stolen secret time back from the flutter of hurried days, but somehow a secret space as well. I could stretch out, free to think again, to be wholly creative, to learn meaningfully and to switch off. It was like a cleansing spring shower had come to wash away the mucky detritus left after the long-cluttered winter of my mind.

But, wherever I went I got bloody lost. Wandering cluelessly around London, only to miss appointments, became a frequent pastime. I know it’s a cliche but what did we do before Google Maps?! I was useless. My fella on the other end of the phone became my personal 118 and Siri (“Babe, can you check the postcode for such-and-such”; “Can you check my Gmail for what so-and-so said about what-chama-flip”). When he didn’t answer (almost certainly on purpose) I’d squander huge mounds of cash phoning a real 118 service.

The change was worth it, though. It’ll sound like an overstatement but I think it changed my life. My choices are broader and healthier because I’m not being screamed at all day.

I bought a new phone last week: the Samsung something-or-other. Like a tiny Cardi B in my pocket, it pings and krrrrrs. I had been scared of the rate of progress, crying: “Stop the train! Stop the madness.” But I want to be part of building the future, and to do that you’ve got to swim in the contemporary waters. Rejecting the modern world doesn’t help anyone. It slows you down and I need to be efficient. The futurist Ray Kurzweil, whose Ted talks are essential listening, says: “Our intuition about the future is linear. But the reality of information technology is exponential, and that makes a profound difference.” I don’t want to be left behind waiting to take what I perceive as the next logical step. The “human engine” doesn’t wait.

Time will tell whether I’ve mastered the wisdom or adulthood not to fall foul of my checking compulsions. But if I become “the phone-checker” (like Eliot’s “typist” in The Waste Land, the action absorbing identity) I know that I’ve got a crappy block of pink plastic in a drawer that can always bring me back to the real world.",-0.9381,
93,Technology,US dismisses South Korea’s launch of world-first 5G network as ‘stunt’,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/04/us-dismisses-south-koreas-launch-of-world-first-5g-network-as-stunt,2019-04-04T14:39:11Z,"South Korea has claimed it beat the US by a matter of hours to become the first country to roll out a super-fast 5G mobile network, which allows users to download entire movies almost instantaneously.

Three South Korean carriers – SK Telecom, KT and LG Uplus – launched 5G services at 11pm local time on Wednesday, according to media reports, but only for a handful of celebrities in what their US rival dismissed as a publicity stunt.

“SK Telecom [has] announced that it has activated 5G services for six celebrities representing Korea as of 11pm 3 April 2019,” the country’s biggest mobile operator said in a news release on Thursday.

The launch was reportedly brought forward by two days, as speculation mounted that the US mobile carrier Verizon planned to launch its own service ahead of schedule and claim the title of the world’s first 5G provider.

With national pride at stake, South Korean government regulators modified service terms so that the carriers could quickly sign up half a dozen celebrity customers, including two members of the K-pop band EXO and the former Olympic figure-skating gold medalist Kim Yuna.

Verizon’s 5G service also appeared on Wednesday in parts of Chicago and Minneapolis – a week ahead of its scheduled 11 April launch but a little later than the three South Korean carriers, according to Yonhap news agency.

The US firms said it planned to introduce the new service in more than 30 locations across the country by the end of the year.

Ordinary consumers in South Korea, which has one of the world’s highest smartphone penetration rates, will be able to connect to 5G services from Friday – the original launch day – when Samsung begins sales of the Galaxy S10 5G, the world’s first available smartphone with the technology built in. LG Electronics will release its 5G smartphone later this month.

South Korea’s three carriers plan to expand their combined coverage to 85 cities by the end of the year.

Verizon’s network will work with Lenovo’s Moto Z3 smartphone fitted with a special accessory, while rival US carrier AT&T launched a 5G-based system in parts of 12 cities in December, although it is only accessible to invited users through a free hotspot device, rather than paying customers with mobile phones.

Despite South Korea’s claim to have won the battle for 5G bragging rights, Japan’s Nikkei business paper said the race may still be too close to call, noting that Verizon’s announcement was made at 11am US eastern time, while South Korea’s SK said it had switched on its service an hour earlier.

“They gave phones to six celebrities and they’re trying to say that constitutes a network launch? That’s a PR stunt,” Kevin King, director of corporate communications at Verizon, told the Nikkei.

“We launched a network and made 5G devices available for any customers that wanted them. We had devices in stores in Chicago and Minneapolis, and available for purchase online.”

Officials in South Korea, meanwhile, claimed the country’s reputation as a hyper-connected society had been enhanced – if only by a whisker.

“The government and private companies came together to achieve the world’s first commercialised 5G services and this proves once again our country is undoubtedly the top powerhouse in information and communications,” said You Young-min, South Korean minister for science and information technology.

The US and South Korea are among several countries hoping for a share of 5G-related economic benefits estimated to be worth US$565bn globally by 2034, according to the Global System for Mobile Communications in London.

Chinese firms have invested heavily in the technology, while Japan’s mobile carriers plan to have a full 5G service in place in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

Patents for 5G are dominated by Chinese companies, with 3,400 5G patents – including 1,529 registered by Huawei – followed by South Korea with 2,051 patents and the US with 1,368.

Officials in the US and Britain have warned that Huawei’s heavy involvement in 5G technology poses a security risk, as it could give Beijing access to connected utilities and other components.",0.9869,

The cost of borrowing liras overnight on the offshore swap market soared past 1,000 percent at one point on Wednesday because local banks are under pressure not to provide liquidity to foreign fund managers who want to bet against the lira. A government official said the measures are temporary.

This has forced investors who want out of their lira positions to instead sell other Turkish assets to get the cash they need to close those trades. The yield two-year on Turkish bonds jumped above 20 percent and stocks slid the most since July. Fund managers including Japan’s Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. said they are rethinking investments in the country.

“I’ve never seen a move like this in the 21 years I’ve been watching this market,” said Julian Rimmer, a trader at Investec Bank Plc in London. “This amounts to sacrificing long-term pragmatism for a short-term political expedient. Such tactics will make many traders question the investability of the lira.",-0.6007,

Indeed, the index has begun to rise again this week. Nonetheless, we think that it may be dawning on investors that the FOMC won’t be able to shore up the economy very easily.

Last autumn’s slump in the S&P 500 was triggered by emerging concerns about the future health of the economy in the US, while demand in the rest of the world was weak. Although the incoming data in the US were generally still upbeat, investors began to worry that the FOMC would soon kill off the recovery if it tightened policy much more. So they sent the Committee, which at the time was still signalling the need for further rises in interest rates, a message not to overdo it: during this period, they all but factored out more hikes.

Of course, the message did not fall on deaf ears at the FOMC, which subsequently pledged to be “patient” when it came to making changes to interest rates in the future. Up until last week’s FOMC meeting, investors took the view that this patience would prevent the US economy from slowing by as much as they had feared. So stock prices rebounded, while expected interest rates remained low. After the meeting, though, investors initially became unsettled again, even though expected interest rates fell even further as the FOMC reiterated its patient approach. This coincided with poor PMI data in the US and Europe.",-0.4411,
96,Technology,Huawei P30 Pro’s 5x optical zoom steps up phone camera wars,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/26/huawei-p30-pro-5x-periscope-zoom-quad-camera-leica-phone,2019-03-26T13:30:24Z,"The Huawei P30 Pro is the first smartphone to have a 5x periscope-like optical zoom and four cameras on the back.

Stepping up the smartphone camera wars another notch, the latest flagship smartphone from the Chinese firm at the centre of a political storm looks to raise the bar not only for camera quality but also flexibility.

The previous Huawei P20 Pro had three cameras on the back with a 3x optical zoom. The £899 P30 Pro adds an extra depth-sensing time-of-flight (TOF) camera for improved portrait and augmented reality modes, joining the main 40-megapixel camera and a 20-megapixel ultrawide angle camera. The company says its new SuperSpectrum camera is capable of absorbing significantly more light for dramatically improved low-light performance, an area of smartphone photography the company dominates alongside Google.

But it is the new eight-megapixel SuperZoom camera, which like a periscope uses a prism to reflect light down the inside of the width of the phone to make room for the required series of lenses for a 5x optical zoom, that is the most interesting.

“We’re going to completely rewrite the rules of smartphone photography, and we can do this because we own the complete ecosystem within the smartphone. All the little elements, not just the camera,” said Peter Gauden, the company’s global senior product marketing manager, talking about the use of Huawei-made processors and other chips.

Huawei says its resulting 5x optical zoom beats the digital zooms of competitors using only 2x optical zoom cameras, and that its additional 10x hybrid zoom and up to 50x digital zoom, which use data from multiple cameras to increase detail, is the best in the business.

Ben Wood, chief of research at market analysis firm CCS Insight, said: “Huawei’s new 5x optical zoom is an interesting addition, but it will be tough to get people to upgrade from last year’s P20 Pro, which is still on sale and more of a bargain than ever. There’s no question, however, that particularly in smartphone photography, Huawei has some real momentum at the moment.”

The P30 Pro also has a giant 6.47in OLED screen with a small teardrop notch containing a 32-megapixel selfie camera at the top. Huawei has eschewed the 3D face recognition system it introduced on the Mate 20 Pro for an improved optical in-screen fingerprint scanner located towards the bottom of the screen. It has also removed the phone’s earpiece speaker, replacing it with what the company calls “electromagnetic levitation”, which vibrates the screen itself, turning it into a speaker.

The rest of the phone resembles last year’s Mate 20 Pro with curved glass front and back, a range of pearlescent and interesting colours, a fairly large-capacity battery and both 40W wired and 15W wireless charging. It can also reverse wirelessly charge another phone or device, a trick introduced with the company’s other phones last year.

Alongside the P30 Pro, which costs £899 with 128GB of storage or £1,099 with 512GB of storage, Huawei also unveiled the slightly cheaper and smaller £699 P30, which has a 6.1in OLED screen, the same in-screen fingerprint scanner, 128GB of storage and premium design. It has a triple camera system on the back but only 3x optical zoom, and has a traditional flat glass front and back, rather than curved.

97,Technology,Samsung surprises market with first-quarter profit warning,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/26/samsung-surprises-market-with-first-quarter-profit-warning,2019-03-26T11:44:08Z,"Samsung has issued a surprise profit warning, blaming a slump in memory chip prices and slowing demand for display panels. It is the latest sign that technology firms are facing tougher times amid a global economic slowdown.

The warning from the South Korean technology company comes two months after Apple shocked investors with its first profit warning since 2002, citing the “magnitude” of the economic slowdown in China.

A few days later, Samsung, the world’s biggest chip and smartphone maker, forecast its first drop in quarterly operating profits in two years. It blamed “mounting macro uncertainties” for weaker chip and smartphone sales in the fourth quarter of 2018.

The market remains tough and on Tuesday, Samsung, which is heavily reliant on computer chips, said its first-quarter profits would miss forecasts. “The company expects the scope of price declines in main memory chip products to be larger than expected.”

Analysts have warned of the impact of China’s economic slowdown and the US-China trade tensions on global electronics firms. Weaker smartphone sales and fewer orders from data-centred companies such as Amazon and Google have led to a glut of memory chips and sent prices sliding.

Samsung has also been hit by poor demand for Apple’s iPhones, for which it supplies the display panels and chips. Apple is its competitor in smartphones but also Samsung’s biggest customer.

Apple said in January that weak iPhone sales and the Chinese downturn reduced its revenues by 4.5% to $84.3bn (£63.7bn) in the three months to 29 December from a year earlier. Profits fell to $19.97bn. Smartphone sales have also slowed because consumers now take longer to upgrade their phones.

Lee Won-sik, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities, told Reuters: “Inventories piling up on its memory chip side and the weak performance of its display panels business due to bad sales of Apple’s iPhones are hurting profitability for Samsung.”

Samsung was forecast to make a 7.2tn won (£4.66bn) operating profit between January and March, less than half the 15.6tn won a year ago. Sales were expected to fall to 53.7tn won from 60.6tn won a year ago.

The company told shareholders at its annual meeting last week that sales of memory products were likely to pick up again in the second half of the year.

While both companies have blamed China’s slowdown, Apple and Samsung are also facing fierce competition from numerous rivals around the world, including firms in China that can match their hardware quality and produce cheaper phones.

Samsung is to launch a folding phone that has been nearly a decade in the making, priced at $1,980 and available on 26 April in the US and on 3 May in Europe.",0.7684,
98,Technology,Six of the best 4k HDR TVs,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/24/six-of-the-best-4k-hdr-smart-tvs-television,2019-03-24T09:00:36Z,"Let’s face it. Your current TV is showing its age. Its resolution is resolutely HD (so very 00s) and it doesn’t even respond to voice commands, no matter how loud you bawl. Maybe the time has come to upgrade to something cutting edge.

Connected smart TVs are now standard fare. With integrated streaming services, you can season binge from Netflix and Amazon Prime Video without the need for an additional set top box or dongle – or multiple remotes. Just connect the TV to your home wifi or router.

Catch-up TV is also on tap. Most of these screens offer players from all the main channels (BBC, ITV, C4 and Channel 5). Freeview Play enabled TVs even have a retrospective seven-day programme guide, which makes it easier to look back and find shows you might have missed.

All these TVs are also 4k. That means they have a screen resolution of 3840×2160 pixels, which is four times better than Full HD (aka 1080p), so you can be sure of the sharpest picture possible from 4k movies, TV and sports.

Unlike 3D, 4k isn’t a fad. You can watch it on Sky Q, VirginMedia V6 and BT TV telly boxes, as well as from streaming services including Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. You can also buy 4k UHD Blu-rays (UHD is often used as a euphemism for 4k) and play 4k games on an XBox One X or PS4 Pro.

What’s more, these screens are also HDR (high dynamic range) enabled, which means their images have a hyperreal glint to them, with bright highlights and deep shadow detail.

And you’ll need to think bigger. Televisions are getting larger, with 55in and 65in screens increasingly popular. This year, Samsung will have more 75in sets in its range than ever before. Improving definition is enabling products to size up without compromising picture quality.

Ultra-thin bezels on the latest sets mean a 50in screen today can fit into the same space as a 42in telly from just a few years ago. And improved resolution means you can sit closer, or watch bigger from the same vantage point. Indeed, you need to do one or the other, to enjoy all those extra pixels.

This LG offers a lot of UHD technology for the cash. The 4k set uses proprietary LG image enhancement to make the most of HDR (known as 4K Active HDR here), and boasts a particularly wide viewing angle. From the side it doesn’t quickly shed contrast and colour (making it a good choice for family living rooms).

Image sharpness and colour performance are fine, but for the best black level performance and contrast, don’t watch in complete darkness, or deep blacks will look grey.

This TV also uses one of the best smart platforms, webOS. Using LG’s cursor-like Magic Remote, it features a wide range of streaming services, including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Now TV, so you probably won’t run out of stuff to watch. There’s also voice control, via LG’s ThinQ AI and built-in Google Assistant.

Verdict: Brilliant-value smart screen

This equally thin flatscreen combines two covetable features – OLED (organic light emitting diode) TV technology and Ambilight. The latter was introduced by Philips in 2002. For the uninitiated, Ambilight is a lighting system that enables the TV to act as a mood lamp in your room. Tiny LED lights cast swaths of colour across the surrounding wall, either in sympathy with what’s on screen, or as solid blocks of colour.

Should you wish, you can integrate this light show with a Philips HUE smart lighting system, so the TV syncs with the rest of your room lights.

OLED picture quality is gloriously cinematic: 4k images are pin- sharp, and OLED’s perfect blacks (a characteristic of the technology) really make pictures sing.

Smart connectivity is decent. The 803 uses the latest Android 8 Oreo smart TV platform, and offers all the key streaming services (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube), although catch-up is limited to the BBC iPlayer.

Verdict: OLED images and Ambilight are a winning combination

Samsung’s 2019 Q Series QLEDs combine the vibrant appeal of LED LCD TVs with the dynamic black level performance of OLED. The Q60R isn’t just the cheapest in this range, it’s also arguably the best looking – wafer thin, with a minuscule bezel.

Thanks to the QLED images are rich, with ravishing colours and fine image detail.

Smart connectivity is built around Samsung’s Tizen platform, which in addition to the usual selection of streaming services and catch-up TV, has an Apple iTunes movies and TV app. Exclusive to Samsung, you can now ask Siri to play your online movies without the need for an external Apple TV box.

Even smarter, it also boasts ambient mode, which allows the screen to mimic your wallpaper or display works of art when it’s in standby. If that sounds a little pretentious, you can always just slump back and play Fortnite. With ultra-low input lag, gameplay won’t feel sluggish.

Verdict: Sleek-looking and a great choice for gamers

If you want to bring cinema home, consider the Panasonic GX800. This super-slim LED LCD model offers Dolby Atmos audio and Dolby Vision, which means highly precise, cinema-style HDR image processing and immersive sound from 4k Blu-rays, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.

Fine-tuned by Hollywood colourists, the picture quality features bags of detail and supreme colour fidelity. This set is designed from the ground up to partner popcorn.

Smart connectivity is stellar too. In addition to Freeview Play, which combines a seven-day roll-back TV guide with all the main catch-up TV services, there’s also a full bill of streaming services, and compatibility with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.

Verdict: The perfect smart TV for film fans

FALD (full array local dimming) might sound like a government department, but in reality is clever LCD technology that improves bright picture highlights and enhances HDR dazzle.

Indeed, there’s an entire lexicon of tech at work here: in addition to FALD, X-tended dynamic range PRO gives contrast a lift, while Sony’s X1 ultimate picture processor makes even bad TV programmes look good. The truly clever thing about Sony’s image processing is that you never really know it’s working. Pictures look perfectly natural. The set also offers Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, plus a Netflix calibrated mode, said to give the best possible picture from the streaming service.

Adding a sonic edge is acoustic multi-audio technology. To combat the sometimes feeble sound of flatscreens, the XG95 uses extra sound positioning tweeters in the rear of the TV to give the impression audio is coming directly from the centre of the screen.

Verdict: Expensive but exceptionally clever

Just 51mm thin, the model looks swish with a stainless steel central pedestal and metallic bezel trim. Image quality is fine, although not as sharp and rich as Samsung’s QLED models. The main reason to buy is the smartphone-style Android 7 TV platform, which allows you to run a bunch of apps intended only for smartphone or tablet use.

Consequently, this Cello is the first TV we’ve seen able to run the Sky Q mobile app. This means that if you have a Sky Q set top box running on a TV in another room, this set can log on and access all the same TV shows and recordings, without the need for a separate Sky box. Sky won’t be best pleased, but it works a treat. You may need to budget for a soundbar, as the audio quality isn’t great.

Verdict: Good-value QLED screen with a huge selection of apps

99,Music,"Spycams, sex abuse and scandal: #MeToo reaches Korean pop",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/22/metoo-k-pop-music-industry-sexaul-assault-scandals-korean-cultural-life,2019-03-22T11:34:51Z,"For many South Koreans, the admission by a young man that he secretly filmed himself having sex with women and shared the footage with other men was yet more evidence of a culture of misogyny and sexual abuse that has put the country at the epicentre of Asia’s #MeToo movement.

The sordid details of the man’s alleged misconduct sounded familiar in a society struggling to cope with a voyeurism epidemic – especially in a week when two men were arrested for allegedly filming 1,600 guests across 30 South Korean hotels with spycams – but with one crucial difference. The latest allegations of sexual misconduct involve some of the best-known figures in K-pop, South Korea’s most successful cultural export.

In the space of a week, allegations surrounding the singer-songwriter Jung Joon-young and Seungri, a member of the internationally popular boyband Big Bang, have snowballed into overlapping sex and corruption scandals that have exposed K-pop’s dark underbelly and prompted a backlash among all but the most obsessive fans.

Jung said he would retire from showbusiness and admitted that he had shared with members of a chatroom footage of him having sex with several women without their knowledge. Members of the chatroom allegedly included Seungri, who is alleged to have run an illegal prostitution ring out of nightclubs in Seoul’s trendy Gangnam district. The 29-year-old singer has denied the allegations.

Allegations of sexual misconduct have shattered the wall of silence that protected K-pop – the vanguard of the Hallyu wave of Korean pop culture whose global brand recognition ranks alongside that of Samsung smartphones and Hyundai cars.

Reports of sexual and other forms of abuse have plagued other areas of the South Korean entertainment industry for years.

It is a decade since the soap star Jang Ja-yeon killed herself at her home near Seoul, leaving a seven-page letter in which she claimed she had been the victim of sexual abuse and exploitation. Jang wrote that she had been forced to have sex with 31 influential men, including politicians, business and newspaper executives and entertainment industry figures. Some of the suspects were investigated and acquitted.

Since then, South Korea’s #MeToo movement, inspired by fury over the widespread use of spycams for molka, the secret filming of women in public places, has been credited with exposing sexual abuse and misconduct in the film industry, politics and the church.

In 2017, the acclaimed film director Kim Ki-duk was accused of sexually and physically abusing an actress. Prosecutors dropped the sex abuse charge, citing lack of evidence, but fined Kim for physical assault. Earlier this month, Kim filed a damages suit, demanding 300 million won ($265,000) from a South Korean women’s rights group that had campaigned on the actress’s behalf.

In February, Ahn Hee-jung, a former provincial governor who was considered a presidential hopeful, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison for sexually assaulting a female aide. And in January, South Korea’s human rights commission announced the country’s biggest ever investigation into sexual abuse in sport, after a wave of female athletes came forward to allege they had been raped or assaulted by their coaches.

“The new atmosphere created by #MeToo helped expose the K-pop scandals,” said Lee Taek-gwang, a cultural commentator. “The tables have been turned and now the K-pop industry has been forced to confront reality. It has to create a new morality.”

While other sectors of the entertainment industry finally reckoned with the damage caused by tolerance of sexual misconduct, K-pop appeared immune, despite revelations of mistreatment ranging from labour law violations to psychological and physical abuse.

Typically, promising stars are put through a gruelling training schedule as they pass along the conveyor-belt production of new girl and boybands to replace their quickly superannuated colleagues. Like their J-pop counterparts in Japan, young stars are subjected to strict controls over their private lives, including bans on dating, restrictions on mobile phone use and an expectation that they will sacrifice their health to achieve the desired – and in the case of female singers, highly sexualised – image.

The sexual abuse allegations involving other prominent figures had primed the South Korean public for the contagion’s inevitable spread to K-pop, according to Michael Hurt, a sociologist at the University of Seoul. “People are ready to accept this has happened and that something needs to be done about it,” he said.

“No one who is familiar with the creative industries, especially K-pop, is surprised these things have happened. The sheer scale and immorality involved is driving most of the negative reaction in South Korea, but deep in the background is the fact that we’re talking about a national shame on the international stage. It’s a black eye to Korea, because K-pop is such a metonym for Korea.”

Over the the past decade, K-pop has helped South Korea project its soft power, even when perceptions of the country were dominated by its proximity to nuclear-armed North Korea. The boyband BTS alone are worth more than $3.5bn annually to the South Korean economy, the Hyundai Research Institute said in a recent report, adding that the band were the reason why one in every 13 foreign tourists visited South Korea in 2017.

This week, the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, vowed to clean up the entertainment industry after more than 200,000 people signed a petition on the presidential office’s website demanding a thorough investigation into alleged crimes. Along with sexual misconduct and prostitution, these include corruption involving a senior police official who allegedly turned a blind eye to alleged crimes committed at a club where Seungri was an executive director.

“The current leadership of the prosecution service and police should stake the fate of their organisations on uncovering the truth and becoming a law enforcement agency that can reveal its own shameful acts in order to regain the public’s trust,” said Moon, a liberal who was elected in 2017 after abuse of power allegations toppled his predecessor, Park Geun-hye.

“Without investigating the facts of the incident involving the elite class of society, we cannot say we have a fair society,” added Moon, who ordered officials to reopen the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Jang Ja-yeon’s 2009 suicide.

The obsessive adherence to K-pop’s established formula for success is producing generations of young performers poorly equipped to navigate the moral minefield of life outside their shared accommodations and recording studios, said Kim Sung-soo, an entertainment industry commentator. “If the agencies do not give sufficient care to their stars, including education and stress management, they will end up raising walking time bombs.”

Investors, meanwhile, are losing faith in K-pop’s financial pulling power. Shares in YG Entertainment, which represents Seungri, fell more than 20% after the allegations were first reported at the end of February, while shares in other top management firms have also been hit.

Reports that a senior police official allegedly covered up Seungri’s alleged crimes demonstrate that the male-dominated power structure created during South Korea’s spectacular economic development in the 1970s and 80s has survived the global spread of the country’s pop culture, according to Lee.

“The Korean wave may be new, but it has failed to rid itself of traditional power relations that allowed men to do whatever they wanted because they were confident they would never be punished,” he said. “They had a sense of psychological entitlement that it was acceptable to break the law.”

But he added that the involvement of some of the country’s top celebrities should be the catalyst for reconfiguring how the entertainment industry treats women. “This is the beginning of a change that should lead to a transformation in the way K-pop views power relations [between the sexes].”

Signs that the authorities are taking allegations of sexual misconduct more seriously emerged on Thursday, when a warrant was issued for Jung Joon-young’s arrest. Earlier in the day, the 30-year-old singer cried during a court hearing as he apologised for his “inexcusable mistake”.

“I apologise to the women who have suffered because of me,” he said. “I will spend the rest of my days repenting for my sins.”

As other artists were implicated in the scandal, Hurt said K-pop’s global popularity and value to the South Korean economy meant it would survive the fallout from the scandals.

But the industry’s international profile would also place it under unprecedented scrutiny. “The only lever that you can use to force domestic social change in Korea is to put it under the international gaze,” he said. “That’s why social media has become so important. Activists can now say that it’s not just embarrassing to people who read Korean newspapers, it can impact us in terms of our GDP, so you’d better pay attention.

“In the past, powerful men would have done everything they could to make something like this disappear. They can no longer do that.”",-0.9973,
100,Technology,Samsung Galaxy S10+ review: a simply stunning screen,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/11/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-review-smartphone-ultrasonic-triple-camera,2019-03-11T06:00:08Z,"The Galaxy S10+ may be Samsung’s most important phone in years, but at £899 does the huge screen, triple camera and fancy ultrasonic fingerprint scanner make for a worthy upgrade?

One thing is obvious: the Galaxy S10+ is not the future of smartphones. That would be the Galaxy Fold and Huawei Mate X, devices with folding screens that cost £2,000-plus. Instead the the Galaxy S10+ is one of the finest examples of today’s smartphones. Iterative but excellent. And you won’t need a mortgage to buy it.

Everything starts with the screen, and oh what a screen it is. At 6.4in it’s a monster, pushed all the way to the top and bottom, and curve at the sides with a hole in the screen in the top right corner through which the dual selfie-cameras poke.

Honor’s View20 had this hole-punch notch design first, but Samsung’s made it its own with a screen that is easily the best ever on any device. Nothing comes close to the sheer beauty of it, with rich colours, inky blacks, competition-crushing brightness and an image quality that has me seriously considering having to upgrade my TV. Out of the box it’s set to full HD+ resolution for power-saving reasons, but it is a QHD+ screen. I never felt the need to increase the resolution, unlike last year’s S9+, but it’s there if you want it, or have 4K movies to watch on it.

Despite the gigantic screen, the curved glass, lack of bezels and 175g weight make the Galaxy S10+ just under the limit of what I can comfortably hold. For comparison, the S10+ is 1.8mm wider than the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and 3.3mm narrower than Apple’s iPhone XS Max, but is significantly lighter by 14g and a full 33g respectively. Weight can determine how difficult it is to hold something of that size.

It’s not all good news, however. The curved screen pushed right to the edges meant I registered unwanted touches from my palm in the bottom right corner, which sometimes resulted in my zooming in Chrome rather than scrolling. An occasional annoyance rather than a deal killer, but not something that affected either the Mate 20 Pro nor Galaxy S9+.

The rest of the device is very well made. A polished aluminium frame and curved glass back with a small central triple camera lump means the phone doesn’t rock when you type on it flat on a desk.

The bottom of the phone has the USB-C port and, surprisingly for 2019, a normal, 3.5mm headphone socket. The Galaxy S10+ has the now expected IP68 water resistance rating, making it good up to a depth of 1.5m for up to 30 minutes, or more likely, a trip down the loo.

Samsung makes the Galaxy S10+ with one of two processors depending on your region. In the US it ships with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855, but in Europe and most of the rest of the world it comes with Samsung’s Exynos 9820 – the version tested here.

While there appears to be some potential energy efficiency and raw processing power differences, both processors should behave similarly under most circumstances. As such the Galaxy S10+ matched the best from 2018 on general day-to-day actively, feeling smooth and responsive throughout. Gaming was equally smooth, even after extended periods.

The S10+ is therefore iterative in performance over last year, but a big leap over the Galaxy S8 from 2017.

Battery life is slightly better than last year’s Galaxy S9+, which lasted 26 hours between charges. Used as my primary device without any special power-saving or performance modes active, the Galaxy S10+ lasted an average of just over 30 hours between charges.

With the screen set to FHD+ and the always-on display (AOD) setting off, the phone would last from 7am on day one until about lunchtime on day two. That was while browsing and using apps for five hours with 100 or so push messages, watching 60 minutes of Amazon Prime Video, shooting about 10 photos a day and listening to about five hours of music using Bluetooth headphones.

Enabling one of the various power saving modes will add hours to that time, while increasing the screen resolution or turning on AOD to show notification icons and the time on the screen all the time reduced battery life by about 8% - a trade-off not worth making in my opinion.

It’s also worth noting that the Galaxy S10+ started with pretty poor battery life, which got longer the more I used the phone. It took two weeks for it to settle down, presumably after the adaptive battery technology had learned my patterns. I saw a similar thing with Google’s Pixel 3.

I expect the Galaxy S10+ to easily make it through even the hardest of use days after about two weeks. It’s quite slow to charge, taking about 100 minutes to hit 100% via the cable, which is 40 minutes longer than the Mate 20 Pro, and longer still via wireless charging.

The Galaxy S10 line is the first to launch with Samsung’s new version of Android, the One UI, which is based on the latest Android 9 Pie.

For the first time, Samsung has nailed the software experience on its Galaxy smartphones. One UI is a shift-change in thinking about how software should work on today’s giant smartphones. In many ways, it is an admission that screens have become too big and too difficult to use.

Instead of filling the entire screen with interaction points, Samsung has attempted to move as many of the elements you have to touch as possible to the bottom of the screen – while leaving the top full of the things you read but don’t have to touch that often.

Menus, buttons, icons and things like that are now in easy reach of your thumb. You can even swipe down on the homescreen to pull the notification shade down, with big elements making good use of the massive screen. Others are doing similar with Android, including Google, but Samsung is the most successful to date – something Apple and its back button in the top left of the screen should take note of.

Samsung’s gesture navigation system is also interesting, replacing the standard back, home and overview buttons with swipe pads that do the same thing in the same place on the screen. It’s efficient and defeats the object of having flowing swiping gestures in the first place. The home button can also be dragged to the right to cycle through recently used apps, an innovation introduced by Google with Android 9 Pie, but it lacks haptic feedback so is slightly more difficult to use.

Samsung’s voice assistant, Bixby, has also improved slightly with routines and a British English option. But it isn’t anywhere near as good as Google Assistant, and this version is unlikely to stop “Bixby” from being one of the top auto-suggest options for searches for the keyword “disable”.

The dedicated Bixby button can be remapped to launch another app on a single press, with Bixby relegated to a double-press or a press and hold, which helps prevent accidental activation.

Overall, Samsung has significantly upped its software game and is no longer lagging behind the likes of Google, by introducing some good ideas that improve usability.

New for this year is an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner embedded under the screen, which is meant to be more secure than the optical in-screen fingerprint readers fitted to the Mate 20 Pro and OnePlus 6T.

While still not quite matching the speed of traditional capacitive fingerprint sensors from 2018, it is the best in-display scanners yet, working around 90% of the time, even when my finger was a little dirty or damp. Counterintuitively it worked best when I just jabbed at it with my finger, rather than pressing and holding.

Samsung has ditched its iris scanning for the S10+, but there’s traditional 2D camera-based face unlock, which is convenient but less secure.

New for the Galaxy S10+ is a triple rear camera system: one main 12-megapixel camera, a 12-megapixel telephoto camera and a 16-megapixel ultrawide angle camera. Together they allow lossless zoom from 0.5 to 2x, and on to a 10x hybrid zoom, which rivals the very best from Apple and Huawei.

The main camera has a dual-aperture system, switching between an f1.5 and 2.4 depending on the available light, as was introduced with last year’s Galaxy S9+. In good light the camera produces some exceptional photos, with great detail, colour and rapid autofocus, which is as good as the best of its rivals.

Its low-light performance is equally impressive, producing usable photos. But what the S10+ lacks is an effective rival to Google’s night sight or Huawei’s night mode. It does have a low-light mode triggered by the scene optimiser but it isn’t anywhere near as effective.

The ultrawide-angle camera is a lot of fun, as is the live focus mode, which does depth-sensing so you can blur the background in portraits or perform colour isolation. You can also post shots straight to Instagram using a dedicated camera mode, while video capture is also excellent.

Overall, the rear camera on the S10+ has caught up with the best of the rest, falling short only on the night modes.

The S10+ also has a two selfie cameras for fancy focus modes. Even without them it is arguably the best selfie camera in the business, capturing a terrifying amount of detail that you can soften with various beauty modes.
• None The selfie camera is delightfully encircled by a small ring of light circles when activated.
• None All Bixby Vision appears to do is recognise objects and then try and sell you something.
• None The stereo speakers are really good.
• None Alongside 10W wireless charging, the S10+ has Powershare, a trick first introduced by Huawei, with which you can wireless charge another device from the back of your phone.
• None The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is incompatible with most screen protectors, but a compatible one comes included in the box.
• None Bluetooth, wifi, calling and mobile data performance were all excellent.

The Samsung Galaxy S10+ costs £899 with 128GB of storage in white, black or green glass. A ceramic-backed version in either white or black costs £1,099 with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage or £1,399 with 12GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.

By comparison, the recommended retail prices of the competition are £900 for the 128GB Huawei Mate 20 Pro, the 128GB Samsung Galaxy Note 9 costs £799, the 64GB Google Pixel 3 XL costs £869, the 64GB iPhone XS Max costs £1,099, 128GB Honor View20 costs £500 and the 64GB OnePlus 6T costs £499.

With Huawei snapping at its heels, Apple pushing ultra-premium devices and the world claiming smartphone innovation dead, the Galaxy S10+ is the most important mainstream smartphone for Samsung in the past three years.

Thankfully the fit, finish and screen are simply amazing, performance is good, battery life is good, the cameras are a lot of fun, the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is really good, you can wirelessly charge something else, and it even has a headphone socket and a microSD card slot. All that packed into a device that weighs less and is easier to hold than most of its big-screen competition.

As important are Samsung’s great strides in software and experience, elevating it beyond Chinese rivals. While £899 doesn’t sound cheap, it undercuts arch-rival Apple’s iPhone XS Max by £200 and you get twice the storage.

Yes it’s iterative. And of course it’s not perfect: accidental touches were a slight irritation at first, the battery life could be longer and it really needs a rival to Google’s night sight too. Plus, there’s the cheaper and smaller Galaxy S10 or even the S10e to consider.

But with the Galaxy S10+ Samsung has hit a home run. If you want the very best big-screen smartphone you can buy right now, this is it.

101,Opinion,Never mind the hype. 5G is arriving with deeply mysterious baggage | John Naughton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/10/5g-network-giants-huawei-blocked-by-america,2019-03-10T07:00:37Z,"At the 2019 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona the other week, all the talk was all about 5G, the Newest New Thing in mobile communication technology. If at this stage your eyes begin to glaze over, then you have my sympathy. But stay tuned: this stuff is more intriguing than you might think. And aspects of it are deeply mysterious.

First, some basics. Like most technologies, mobile communications goes in “generations”. At the moment, we are supposedly in the fourth generation – which is why you sometimes see “4G” next to the network signal icon on your phone. I say “supposedly”, because if you live outside a major conurbation, you are more likely to see “3G”, which means that you are stuck in the previous generation, despite the fact that the industry likes to pretend that 4G is ubiquitous.

The basic idea behind these generational shifts is that things get steadily better for consumers in terms of bandwidth, speed and connection quality. 5G promises vast improvements in terms of high data rates, reduced latency (ie, lag), energy saving, cost reduction, higher system capacity, and massive device connectivity. Just considering data rates, the best that 4G can do at the moment is about 14mbps (megabits per second). Experiments by Verizon in the US suggest that 5G could do between 30 and 50 times better – downloading a complete movie in 15 seconds, compared with six minutes on 4G. A bigger argument for 5G is not speed, however, but capacity: current mobile technology cannot handle the communications needs of a world with billions of IoT (Internet of Things) devices.

A mobile network has two main components: a hard-wired core consisting of a network of base-stations (cell towers) connected by fibre-optic links; and radio links between the towers and consumers’ devices – the so-called “air interface”. Each generational change has required changes to both components, and 5G will be no different, though the upgrades will be more significant and more difficult to implement. The air interface, in particular, will be much more challenging because it will mean that phones have to communicate with base stations using much higher radio frequencies. (Yes, your phone is a radio transmitter.) The good news is that these frequencies enable huge improvements in speed. The bad news is that the signals don’t travel as far as current frequencies do – tens of metres compared with kilometres for 4G signals. This implies the need to install hundreds of thousands of new base stations to ensure meaningful coverage.

5G will therefore require eye-watering levels of investment in new kit by the network operators. The big question is: who makes the kit? The answer is a very select group of companies – Nokia, Ericsson, DoCoMo, Samsung, ZTE and Huawei. Things get interesting when we note their countries of origin – respectively, Finland, Sweden, Japan, South Korea, China, China.

The dominant company in the market at the moment is Huawei, a $100bn giant which is the world’s largest supplier of telecoms equipment and its second largest smartphone maker. In the normal course of events, therefore, we would expect that the core networks of western mobile operators would have a lot of its kit in them. And initially, that’s what looked like happening. But in recent months someone has pressed the pause button.

The prime mover in this is the US, which has banned government agencies from using Huawei (and ZTE) equipment and called on its allies to do the same. The grounds for this are national security concerns about hidden “backdoors”: it would be risky to have a company so close to the Chinese government building key parts of American critical infrastructure. Last week Huawei filed a lawsuit against the US government over the ban. New Zealand and Australia have obligingly complied with the ban, blocking the use of Huawei’s equipment in 5G networks. And last December BT announced that it was even removing Huawei kit from parts of its 4G network.

Other countries – notably Japan and Germany – have proved less compliant; the German Data Commissioner was even tactless enough to point out that “the US itself once made sure that backdoor doors were built into Cisco hardware”.

The UK’s position is interestingly enigmatic: the National Cyber Security Centre (part of GCHQ) says that any risk posed by involving Huawei’s technology in UK telecoms projects can be “managed”. Its advice to UK mobile operators boils down to this: keep Huawei out of the core of your 5G networks, but it’s OK to use its equipment at phone masts as part of the mix of suppliers. Which leads one to wonder if even GCHQ has been leant on by Liam Fox, the secretary of state for international trade. After all, he might say, this is no time to be annoying the Chinese.

102,Technology,"MWC 2019: folding wrist phones, 5G and quintuple cameras – 8 standout gadgets",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/01/mwc-2019-folding-wrist-phones-5g-and-quintuple-cameras-8-standout-gadgets,2019-03-01T13:51:42Z,"The annual mobile technology jamboree in Barcelona has revealed the latest exciting developments that will feature in phones, tablets and watches over the next 12 months. From folding handsets and ultra-sophisticated cameras to brick-like smartphones with a very long battery life – here are eight of the most notable products from Mobile World Congress 2019 this week.

Annoyed with your phone’s battery not lasting a day? What if you could have a phone that lasted a full week? That’s the idea behind Energizer’s Power Max P18K Pop.

Looking more like a phone strapped to a brick, it has a humongous 18,000mAh battery that’s almost seven times the size of the one in the iPhone XS. It has a 6.2in screen, runs on the latest Android software and will cost €599 in the summer. Whether you’ll be able to squeeze it into a pocket remains to be seen.

Move over 4G, the 5G network is coming later this year. Unlike previous jumps in mobile phone network technology, the handsets are already here, with almost every manufacturer launching a version of their top-end phones with 5G capability.

With much higher capacity, super-quick speeds and ultra-low latency (the time it takes for your phone to contact the internet and get a reply), 5G promises to be the enabler for all sorts of things, from self-driving cars and all sorts of smart devices to high-resolution movies downloaded in seconds.

With the first 5G areas expected to go live in the UK in the summer, it will be some time before everyone can try it out. But you have to start somewhere.

What if your phone could unfold to be the size of a tablet? That’s the basic idea behind Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, which was the first phone with a foldable screen to be launched by a big manufacturer. Samsung put a smaller 4.6in screen on the outside and a bigger 7.3in screen on the inside that opens out like a book for watching videos, browsing the web or multitasking with three apps on the go simultaneously.

It will be available in the US in April and in Europe the following month. The only catch? It will cost $1,980 (£1,500). Or about twice the cost of its new Galaxy S10+. Ouch.

Phones with folding screens wrapped around the outside

Not to be outdone, the Chinese smartphone giant Huawei had a foldable phone on show at MWC, too. But where Samsung’s had the screen on the inside, the Mate X looked even more futuristic, with the foldable screen wrapped around the outside.

When shut it has a 6.6in screen on the front and a 6.38in screen on the back. Turn it over and it swaps the screen from the front to the back of the device, for taking selfies or similar. Unfold the screen outwards and you’re left with one large 8in display ready to go. It has cameras on one side and is 5G-capable.

Huawei said it will be available in the summer for €2,299 (£1,975). No one said pushing boundaries was going to be cheap.

If you like the idea of having a phone that unfolds with a bigger screen but aren’t sold on the idea of a bendable screen, LG has the answer: slap your phone in a case that also contains another phone screen on the inside.

The new top-of-the-range LG V50 ThinQ has a case accessory called the Dual Screen, which attaches to the phone to double the display. It is far from seamless, with a big hinge in the middle, but you can use one screen for your email with a keyboard on the other, or one can be turned into a games controller. Not quite as revolutionary as a folding screen but at least you can take it off when the novelty wears thin.

Holding your phone in your hand is so last century. If the Nubia Alpha is anything to go by, we’ll all be wearing our phones around our wrists. It may look like a sci-fi electronic tag but the 4in flexible display wraps around your wrist like a snap-band with a camera mounted on the front.

It can be activated by touch or even mid-air hand gestures, while users can take calls on it, send messages, shoot photos and watch films on it. Available in April from €449.

Forget virtual reality. The future is mixed or augmented reality, according to the tech giants. Think of what Arnold Schwarzenegger’s character sees in the Terminator film: information overlaid on your real view of the world, albeit via a set of glasses. Microsoft’s Hololens 2 is the latest iteration, now with a larger field of view and more comfortable to wear, even if the helmet-like product is quite chunky.

Users have a virtual display floating in their vision, such as a map of wires and pipes behind a wall about to be subject to your DIY, or instructions on how to fix your your bike, leaving your hands free to do the work. That’s the pitch to businesses – who are the target customers. A consumer version will have to wait for smaller glasses that don’t cost $3,500 a piece.

The days of only having one camera on your phone – or maybe even two - are dead. Now it’s five or bust. Or so says Nokia, with its new 9 PureView smartphone, which has five separate 12-megapixel cameras mounted in an array on the back alongside a flash and a depth-sensor.

Nokia says the system collects up to 10 times the amount of light normally captured by one camera. Instagram influencers will take note. Expected to go on sale for around £550 in March.",0.9829,
103,Technology,Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 review: novel slider finally hits the UK,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/27/xiaomi-mi-mix-3-review-novel-slider-finally-hits-the-uk,2019-02-27T07:00:41Z,"After several years of threatening Xiaomi has finally entered the UK with a series of good-value smartphones starting from £99 including the range-topping Mi Mix 3. But has “China’s Apple” delivered something new, or just another forgettable Chinese smartphone?

At first glance the £499 Mi Mix 3 looks fairly boring. The front has a giant display, just like the rest. The back appears shiny glass, just like the rest. It’s got polished metal sides, just like most. But pick up the phone and you realise it’s hiding more than one secret.

Closer inspection of the good-looking 6.39in full HD+ AMOLED screen shows there’s no notch or camera hole anywhere, and it only has a very slim bezel all round. Instead the screen slides down like something from yesteryear revealing a dual-camera ready to capture your selfies.

The screen slides with a solid and reassuring clunk, and can be accompanied by your choice of tone. By default the slider launches the selfie camera, but it can be configured to launch other apps.

Also, the back is not glass, but ceramic. Highly polished and a fingerprint magnet, but surprisingly grippy in the hand, which combined with the curved sides makes holding on to the Mi Mix 3 relatively easy considering its size.

At 74.7mm wide and 157.9mm tall the Mi Mix 3 is more or less the same as its direct competition: the Honor View20 and OnePlus 6T.

But the Mi Mix 3 weighs 218g, which is a full 38g heavier than the Honor and heavier still than Apple’s 208g iPhone XS Max, which makes it more difficult to handle.

A dual rear camera pops out at the top left of the back, while a good and fast fingerprint scanner is located within easy reach of your index finger in the middle.

The Mi Mix 3 packs the same top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 and 6GB of RAM as most of the competition from 2018 and so is just as capable. Despite the cheaper price you are buying a flagship phone.

That means the Mi Mix 3 will handle pretty much anything you want to do, be it graphically intensive gaming, photo or video processing. Nothing about it feels sluggish with apps loading promptly all round.

Battery life is also solid but not exceptional, lasting around 25 hours between charges with fairly heavy usage, which places it around five hours behind its direct competition. If you forget to charge it overnight, it’ll at least survive till your wake up alarm the next morning.

Charging via included cable charger hit 50% in just under 30 minutes and reached full in 90 minutes. A small circular wireless charging pad, into which the cabled charger plugs via USB-C, is included in the box, which is pretty rare for any phone, let alone a cut-price one.

Like many of the Chinese smartphone brands, Xiaomi customises Android for its phones with software called MIUI (Mi user interface).

The Mi Mix 3 runs the latest version, MIUI 10.2, which is based on Android 9 Pie, but looks like a cross between Android and iOS. There’s no app drawer, for instance, with all apps having to be placed on the homescreen like iOS, which inevitably leads to folders full of app icons you wish you could hide.

It also comes with a variety of apps pre-installed, such as AliExpress, Twitter, Facebook, Opera and the MIUI forum, but you can delete them.

Generally MIUI works fine, but there are some odd choices. For instance, you can’t swipe notifications away to the left, only to the right. The leftmost homescreen panel is the company’s own screen with shortcuts, your calendar, a “security” widget and a notepad, which I’d trade for Google’s discover feed any day of the week. There’s also a confusing mix of do not disturb (DND) and mute buttons, which can conflict. Turn off DND and it switches on the ringtones and sounds, even if you have the phone set to only vibrate, which means hitting the mute button again.

One good part of MIUI is its navigation gestures, which come a close second to Apple’s best-in-class system for iOS. Swipe up from the bottom to go home, up and hold for the recently used apps. Swipe in from either edge of the screen for back or swipe and hold to go immediately to the last used app.

The rear dual 12-megapixel camera has a similar set up to most with one acting as a regular wide-angle camera and the other a 2x telephoto camera.

Images shot in good light are great, with a good amount of detail and texture, relatively balanced colours and accurate focus, when you get a lock. I found it struggled to get a solid focus occasionally when using the 2x zoom, forcing me to repeatedly tap the screen and slowing down the shot as a result.

Zoom all the way up to 8x matches some of the best too, preserving a good amount of detail at maximum zoom.

The AI system identifies scenes and tweaks colours accordingly, which worked fairly well and wasn’t too aggressive with Instagram-like colour blowout that some similar systems create. Low-light performance was OK, but not up there with the best. Portrait mode was equally good, but not great.

The slider selfie camera is a bit of a mixed bag. It is capable of capturing a good amount of detail, but struggled to focus properly more than once. Beauty mode is there to smooth out skin imperfections if too much detail is a little unflattering. Low light performance was middling, introducing a lot of noise.

Overall, the Mi Mix 3 has a highly capable camera system that keeps up with most of last year’s top phones, but falls short of being the absolute best in a few areas.
• None You get a 10W wireless charging pad in the box which takes the phone’s cabled charger
• None There’s an AI button you can configure to launch Google Assistant, or a variety of other apps or functions
• None The Mi Mix 3 vibrates every time anything turns up in the notification shade, including the download manager for app updates and other bits, which can get annoying
• None A 5G version of the Mi Mix 3 is due to go on sale later this year

The Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 costs £499 in either blue or black.

For comparison, the 128GB Honor View20 costs £500, the OnePlus 6T costs £499, the 128GB Huawei Mate 20 Pro costs £900, the Google Pixel 3 XL costs £869 with 64GB, the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 costs £899 with 128GB and the 64GB iPhone XR costs £749.

Xiaomi’s entry into the UK is a very welcome one. It is capable of producing some really good smartphones at very competitive prices and the Mi Mix 3 is no exception.

At £499 the Mi Mix 3 isn’t just another boring Chinese smartphone. Instead you get something unique with the sliding mechanism solving the problem of where do you put the selfie camera. If you’re someone who doesn’t take many selfies, then this is the ideal solution.

The screen is good, performance is excellent, battery life is solid and camera performance is good too. Plus you get a wireless charger in the box. However, Xiaomi’s MIUI software isn’t up to the competition from Google, OnePlus or Samsung, even if it does have very good gesture navigation.

The Mi Mix 3 is also pretty heavy, even for its size, which makes handling it more difficult compared to lighter devices such as Honor’s View20.

If you want something a bit different the Mi Mix 3 is a great option, and an excellent opening gambit in the UK from Xiaomi.

104,Technology,Huawei unveils Mate X folding phone to rival Samsung Galaxy Fold,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/24/huawei-unveils-mate-x-folding-phone-to-rival-samsung-galaxy-fold,2019-02-24T17:53:33Z,"The Chinese smartphone maker Huawei has followed Samsung’s lead by unveiling a super-luxury 5G phone with a folding screen called the Mate X with a price tag of €2,299 (£1,995).

Introduced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Sunday, the Mate X has a flexible OLED display that covers both the front and back of the device, and which unfolds outwards to become an 8in tablet screen.

Richard Yu, the chief executive of Huawei’s consumer business, said the Mate X represented “a voyage into the uncharted”. “As a new breed of smartphones, Huawei Mate X combines 5G, foldable screen, AI and an all-new mode of interfacing to provide consumers with an unprecedented user experience,” he said.

The Chinese firm, which has been at the centre of a political storm, was pipped to the post by its South Korean rival with the launch of its Galaxy Fold smartphone last Wednesday.

The design of the two cutting-edge devices is quite different. Samsung put the folding screen on the inside of the device, which opens like a book to reveal a 7.3in screen, and a smaller 4.6in screen on the outside for use like a standard phone.

Huawei’s Mate X has just one screen on the outside. When closed, the front screen measures 6.6in, comparing favourably with large non-folding smartphones such as Huawei’s Mate 20 Pro. The screen that folds around the rear is dormant unless used to take photos or for other similar tasks. That leaves the flexible screen exposed to the outside world at all times and at risk of scratching.

The 11mm thick Mate X also has a solid strip on one edge that sits flush with the rear screen when folded over, acts as a handle and contains a quadruple Leica camera system. The phone also features a fingerprint sensor built into its power button, 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, a large battery and a new 55W version of the firms SuperCharge technology that can reach 85% from zero in 30 minutes.

Analysts viewed the unveiling as broadly positive, giving Samsung competition in the new folding-phone space, but were sceptical that a device costing as much as three times current top-end smartphones would sell in significant numbers.

Francisco Jeronimo, an associate vice-president with IDC, said the Mate X’s “form factor seems a lot more user friendly than the Samsung Galaxy Fold”.

Ian Fogg, vice president of analysis for OpenSignal, called the Mate X’s foldable design striking but warned: “Remember a foldable design places new tough demands on all aspects of the hardware, not just the display - it still has to deliver a great network experience, battery life etc.”

Huawei says the Mate X is the “world’s fastest foldable 5G smartphone”, and that its position as a manufacturer of 5G network infrastructure has given it a unique advantage because the company was able to test the phone on internal 5G networks before release.

That same position, however, has also made it a geopolitical talking point. The US has told European countries that it may find it difficult to work with anyone who uses Huawei products in their networks after raising security concerns about the company.

Huawei is the second-largest smartphone manufacturer by volume ahead of Apple and behind Samsung, and it has its eyes on first place. It is also expected to launch a range of flagship smartphones in Paris in March.

Huawei said its Mate X would be available later in the year to coincide with the launch of 5G networks, which are expected to begin limited rollout this summer in the UK and elsewhere. Several other Chinese firms, including Xiaomi, area also expected to unveil folding-screen phone designs this year, as the battle to lead the next wave of smartphone innovation heats up.",0.9327,
105,Technology,"Samsung's $2,000 Galaxy Fold changes the smartphone game",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/21/samsungs-2000-galaxy-fold-finally-changes-the-smartphone-game,2019-02-21T12:37:53Z,"Samsung has placed its stake in the ground with its Galaxy Fold smartphone-tablet folding phone that is spectacular in every way, even in price, and pitches itself years ahead of its arch-rival, Apple.

Nearly a decade in the making, everything about the Galaxy Fold shouts next generation. It has a standard 4.6in phone screen on the front, but open it up like a book and you reveal a single large 7.3in screen that literally folds in half. No lines, no wrinkles, no visible crinkles. It’s a level of luxury and innovation not seen before, and it comes with a truly eye-watering price tag of $2,000. But no one said breaking boundaries was cheap.

Some, such as Ben Wood, the chief of research at CCS Insight, see it as a “magnet for gadget lovers” that is “arguably a solution looking for a problem” – particularly as it costs more than twice as much as Samsung’s other new top-end phone the Galaxy S10+.

But few argue against the sentiment that this kind of boundary breaking is what a stagnating smartphone industry needs, even if it isn’t a mass seller or profit maker.

Francisco Jeronimo, an associate vice-president at the analysts IDC, describes the Galaxy Fold as“one of those announcements that will reshape the future of smartphones”.

The Galaxy Fold was created to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Samsung’s Galaxy S phone line, which alongside the iPhone has been the main driver of the smartphone industry for the last decade.

It is a hero product on which the South Korean firm can hang its mainstream Galaxy S10 offerings and amplify its brand. But it is also one in the eye for Apple, which celebrated the 10th anniversary of its smartphone era with the iPhone X – a brilliant and well-polished product but one that looks rather evolutionary rather than revolutionary next to the Galaxy Fold.

When every phone looks the same and each change appears utterly iterative to the consumer despite costing more and more each year, it’s no wonder that people are holding on to their phones for far longer. Innovation is dead is the cry. Why buy the next big thing, when it’s neither interesting nor cheap and your existing phone still does everything just fine?

“To those who say they’ve seen it all, I say, buckle your seatbelt, the future is about to begin,” DJ Koh, the head of Samsung’s mobile business, said as he held the Galaxy Fold aloft – his big bet on the future of the whole mobile technology industry.

Big bets are needed to break stagnation in the industry and excite consumers once again.

Whether folding phones really take off remains to be seen, but Samsung will not be the only manufacturer with one this year. China’s Huawei is expected to announce one in the next couple of months, as is “China’s Apple”, Xiaomi. And the US-based Chinese company Royole released a developer version of its FlexPai folding phone last year.

The common denominator here is Asia. These innovations in hardware are not being made in the US, while Europe has been left far behind. Even within Asia changes are afoot, with China rising at a rapid rate to challenge the might of South Korea.

With Samsung’s chips on the table, and China soon to join, the question remains as to how long it will take before folding screen phones hit the mainstream at a quarter of the current price. And the consensus appears to be not within five years.",0.9774,
106,Technology,"Galaxy Fold: Samsung unveils hi-tech foldable phone that costs $1,980",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/20/samsung-galaxy-fold-foldable-screen-tablet-phone,2019-02-20T20:35:07Z,"Samsung has unveiled the final design and name for its cutting-edge Galaxy Fold phone that has a screen that folds in half and costs $1,980.

The new device will be released on 26 April in the US and 3 May in Europe, after nearly a decade in the making. The Galaxy Fold literally folds in half like a book to use as a phone with a 4.6in screen on the outside, and unfolds to reveal a large 7.3in screen to use as a tablet on the inside.

The Samsung senior vice-president for mobile Justin Denison said: “With the Galaxy Fold we’re giving you powerful smartphone and a revolutionary tablet.”

Available in 4G and 5G versions, the phone is seen as a crucial product for Samsung as it tries to maintain its position as the biggest smartphone manufacturer against stiff competition from its Chinese rivals.

The Fold has a powerful and smooth hinge with hidden gears, a split battery and a new software system called app continuity that switches between the screen as you open the phone.

It also comes with 12GB of ram and 512GB of storage, making it one of the most powerful smartphones available. It also has six cameras: three on the back, two on the big screen and one on the front screen for selfies when the phone is closed.

DJ Koh, the head of Samsung’s mobile business, said: “We are pushing past the boundaries of technology to inspire renewed innovation and interest in the smartphone industry.

“To those who say they’ve seen it all, I say, buckle your seatbelt, the future is about to begin.”

The world’s second biggest smartphone maker, Huawei, is also expected to announce a folding phone in Barcelona at the end of February, while US-based Chinese firm Royole launched a developer prototype of its FlexPai folding phone last year.

Ben Wood of CCS Insight said: “Unveiling a product just ahead of rivals is an important milestone for Samsung that helps ensure that it stands out as a leader in the smartphone market.”

Folding or expanding devices have been predicted by science fiction for decades. But turning the flexible OLED technology that has formed the basis for the curved screens of Samsung’s top-end smartphone line for the past four years into something repeatedly foldable has proved difficult.

Samsung first showed off its Infinity Flex Display in November, partnering with Google to tempt developers to create apps for the new format. But now Samsung is set to put it on sale, available to the mass market at twice the cost of any other smartphone.

Although the Galaxy Fold is unlikely to sell in similar quantities to the Galaxy S10 line of smartphones also launched on Wednesday, it promises to be the next logical step in the evolution of the smartphone. It offers the utility of a phone and tablet in one device and looks set to see the smartphone cannibalise yet another device, following the death of the music player, the compact camera and perhaps soon the wallet.

The large-screen tablet is likely safe for a few years at least, as Samsung will have to make the technology it is pioneering for the Galaxy Fold available at affordable prices for it to be put out to pasture

But for the time being, Wood said: “The Galaxy Fold will be magnet for gadget lovers despite its high cost and the broader issue of its being a product that is arguable a solution looking for a problem.”",0.9866,
107,Technology,"Samsung Galaxy S10 launch: triple cameras, ultrasonic fingerprint sensors and 5G",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/20/samsung-galaxy-s10-launch-triple-cameras-ultrasonic-fingerprint-sensors-and-5g,2019-02-20T19:30:33Z,"The world’s biggest smartphone maker, Samsung, on Wednesday launches its new Galaxy S10 range, with triple-cameras, ultrasonic in-display fingerprint sensors and becoming the first mainstream phone to have one-terabyte of storage – enough to hold 300,000 selfies.

The Galaxy S10 unveiling is the South Korean firm’s most important this year, as it fights intense competition from China’s Huawei and arch-rival Apple. The S10 comes in three versions initially priced at £669 for the entry level S10e and £899 for the top-end S10+, which compares with the £899 Huawei is charging for its similar Mate 20 Pro, and £1,099 for the top-end Apple iPhone XS Max.

Samsung hopes its new Infinity-o display, which moves the selfie camera to a small hole directly in the screen, will wow buyers and prove that smartphone innovation is not dead for the tenth iteration of the firm’s hugely successful Galaxy S range.

However, analysts warn that after disappointing sales for the S9 range in 2018, the S10 is critical for Samsung as it spars with Apple on one front while defending itself from Chinese challengers on another.

Ben Wood, chief of research for CCS Insight, said: “The S9 and S9+ did not perform as well as Samsung had hoped, primarily due to them not being differentiated enough compared to the highly successful Galaxy S8 products, so it needs the S10 range to be a hit.

“Samsung has consistently delivered the latest features on its smartphones but the S10 portfolio needs to be super competitive to attack Apple and defend Samsung from a rampant Huawei and other Chinese brands that are aggressively looking for growth outside China.”

Samsung is banking buyers will be attracted to devices with top-of-the-line processors, in-display fingerprint scanners and a new triple-camera system, albeit a feature first pioneered by Huawei, offering greater levels of zoom, flexibility and low-light performance.

The Galaxy S10 and S10+ have a new 16-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera, a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera and a 12-megapixel telephoto camera on the back – a similar combination used by Huawei’s Mate 20 Pro to great effect.

The smaller Galaxy S10 will have a 6.1in screen with a circular hole through which the 10-megapixel selfie camera will poke. The larger Galaxy S10+ has a 6.4in screen with an oval-shaped hole containing a dual-selfie camera for enhanced portraits.

Both versions will have at least 128GB of storage but the top-of-the-line S10+ also comes in a special version with a ceramic back, 12GB of RAM and one terabyte storage – a first for a mainstream phone. Quite how useful that much storage will be is a moot point. It’s enough to hold 500 TV shows from Netflix or up to 80 selfies taken every day for the next 10 years. And that’s without adding another 512GB via the microSD card slot.

They will all have a headphone socket, making them unusual for top-end phones in 2018/19, and have the ability to wirelessly charge other devices, a trick pioneered by Huawei last year.

“With it being our 10th anniversary, we wanted to demonstrate meaningful innovation, to make a really strong statement that innovation in smartphones isn’t dead,” said Kate Beaumont, director of commercial strategy, product and planning at Samsung.

Alongside the Galaxy S10 and S10+, Samsung has also launched a slightly cheaper and smaller version of its new flagship called the Galaxy S10e, which has a 5.8in screen that’s flat and a more traditional capacitive fingerprint scanner on the side.

A 5G version of the Galaxy S10 will also go on sale later this year to coincide with the launch of new 5G networks in the UK and elsewhere. The Galaxy S10 5G will have a larger 6.7in display and 3D depth-sensing cameras.

“Before, with 4G, you had to compromise on design with the needed antennas and poor battery but not this time with 5G – you can have a true flagship phone now and be future-proofed for the next four years,” Beaumont said.

While 5G will remain niche, particularly in the UK in 2019, being first to market with a 5G phone is very important for Samsung, explained CCS Insight’s Wood. He said: “Samsung is getting the jump on arch-rival Apple, which is not expected to have a 5G iPhone until the final quarter of 2020.

“But it is also important for mobile phone networks as they need a tier-one brand like Samsung to support their 5G go-to-market strategy.”",0.9966,
108,Cities,'I'm panicking': Seoul rips out its manufacturing heart,https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/20/end-of-an-era-seoul-prepares-to-rip-out-its-manufacturing-heart,2019-02-20T07:00:33Z,"From the main street, the Euljiro neighbourhood doesn’t look like much: some shabby retail stores, cold-noodle restaurants, a Starbucks.

Enter one of the small alleys, however, and you’ll find yourself in a kind of manufacturing anthill: thousands upon thousands of shops, each crammed to the rafters with bolts, circuit boards, iron castings, gauges, wires, lights, switches, tools and innumerable tiny objects that defy description.

This incredible warren of machinists is the manufacturing heart of Seoul. There are 10,000 shops here, with 50,000 tradespeople, many of whom have been working here since the 1950s and were integral to South Korea’s postwar economic boom, the so-called Miracle on the Han.

But even as the tour guides at nearby Jongmyo Shrine extol the history, foibles and eating habits of the long-dead Joseon dynasty, here in Euljiro a living history is about to be unceremoniously wiped out.

Seoul is growing fast. Although the city will only enter the United Nations’ official list of megacities – those with more than 10 million residents – in 2024, the wider metropolitan area is already home to 25 million.
• None Euljiro against the backdrop of newer and taller buildings

In October, the city government gave the green light to Hanho Construction to knock these shops down, as part of a huge plan to redevelop the area around Seoul’s popular Cheonggyecheon stream. The shopkeepers will be evicted and the ecosystem of 10,000 shops destroyed. Apartment buildings will be erected in their place. The process has already begun.

“I’m panicking,” says Kim Hak-ryul, 60, whose shop, Shina Casting, makes iron moulds. “There’s no place to go. We cannot really move to other places – this is an ecosystem.”

Most of the shops in Euljiro sell primarily to each other, working together to solve problems and build prototypes for the industrial and electronics sectors that are so important to the South Korean economy.
• None Kim Hak-ryool (left), and Mr Baek in their metal workshops

“This area is all handmade. It’s a critical place for making samples for big companies like Samsung or LG,” says Kim, who took the shop over from the founding Shina family 15 years ago and kept the name out of pride for its long heritage.

“We can do very diverse work for very small amounts. This is the one place you can do it quickly. If you want something, we can make it in a day or two – probably it would take a month in the US or other countries. We are very quick and very cheap. So the value is very high for Seoul citizens and the industry – but Seoul municipality doesn’t understand that.”

Under the terms of the Sewoon Sangga regeneration project, the shops are being compensated for four months’ worth of revenue. Given many of them conduct business in cash, they are likely to receive much less than their true value. Nor can they scatter around the city and expect to survive: many landlords aren’t keen on dirt and noise, and moving would also separate them from their biggest clients – each other.
• None Jang Jong-il, 60, in his wooden model workshop in Euljiro

These shops are a key part of Seoul’s healthy functioning, past and present, says Park Eun-seon, urban activist and founder of the collective Listen to the City.

“This area is now the oldest area in Seoul. Everything else is postwar. Here we have some originals. The people worked here for a long time, making their own history – and now the government wants to make it offices and apartments. Ridiculous.”

She points out that the government has past form in demolishing first and asking questions later. In 2003, when the Cheonggyecheon stream was originally developed, more than 30,000 street vendors were moved out after an elevated highway was demolished to restore the original river underneath. The waterway is now a favourite socialising spot for Seoulites, and its success helped propel then-mayor Lee Myung-bak to the presidency.

But the area around the redeveloped stream is also prime real estate. It stretches roughly 10km from City Hall in the west to Dongdaemun Design Plaza, a spaceship-like exhibition hall designed by Zaha Hadid. Euljiro is caught in the middle.

Park worries that the fight will end in violence, like many previous regeneration projects. In 2010 six people, including one policeman, died in a fire during an eviction, and then next year she and her peers occupied the Mari Cafe, one of the Euljiro restaurants slated for demolition.

She says anonymous thugs came to threaten them every night, demanding they leave: “They beat you, and swear at you, and pee, and throw poo. In front of ladies they take down their pants and pee in front of you.”

On 3 August 2011, they stepped it up. “It was a terrible night. We did a film exhibition in the Mari Cafe. So they sent 200 thugs. And then we get beaten, and policemen shut the door. Can you believe that? We were inside to protect the building, because … you have to occupy it, you have to squat it. Two hundred gangsters came in and [the police closed the gate]. It was a mess. Many people got injured.”
• None The ‘thugs’ who beat up activists trying to occupy the Mari Cafe in 2011

There are no signs of violence in the current dispute, nor any suggestion that Hanho Construction was involved in any past confrontations, but the Korea Times has reported that the firm has sent aggressive letters to shop owners, bypassing their official tenants’ association. Many of the letters asked for double rent, or claimed damages of up to 500m won (£343,000) for unspecified obstruction, the newspaper said.

“In Korea, this urban substance is still very volatile, very fragile. It could be wiped out depending on any political regime,” says Minsuk Cho, an architect who returned to Seoul from New York in 2003 to establish the firm Mass Studies.

“This is still unfortunately a country addicted to real estate. It’s so sad that young kids nowadays, [if you ask them] what do you want to be in the future, it used to be president and astronauts, now it’s like, ‘I want to be a building owner.’ It’s neo-feudal. Or a K-pop star …”

However, he does sees some cause for optimism in Korea’s history of protest. In 2016, for example, a series of demonstrations in Seoul against corruption swelled to more than 2 million people, according to organisers’ estimates.

“It was like Rio carnival,” Cho recalls. “People are really fed up, but they develop this mass expression, [and express] their common interests and common concerns in a very festive way. You think [South] Korea is just another Asian country that’s really top-down, but we’re really not like that. Although something like a quarter of GDP is from Samsung, and half of national GDP is by these mega chaebol business conglomerates, we still have a country full of tiny shop owners who like it that way – they like the autonomy.”

That David-and-Goliath tension may be coming to a head in Euljiro. In January, following several protests in front of City Hall and a public outcry over the fate of a few well-loved restaurants, the mayor, Park Won-soon, a former civic activist himself, announced a formal review of the regeneration plan. Although the redevelopment has not been cancelled, he has asked a commission of experts to suggest alterations.

The obvious alteration would be to renovate the area rather than knocking it all down, suggests Kim of Shina Casting.

“I don’t understand why they’re destroying everything,” he says. “Everyone here has very different skills – 30- and 40-year-old skills – it’s unique. We are a community, and this is destructive.”

109,Opinion,Refrigerdating: would you date someone because of what's in their fridge? | Arwa Mahdawi,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/17/refrigerdating-would-you-date-someone-whats-in-fridge,2019-02-17T14:30:43Z,"If you are single and looking for a cool new way to meet people, Samsung has just the thing. The electronics company recently launched Refrigerdating, a service that matches you with dates based on what is inside your fridge. It’s like Tinder but you swipe through pictures of food, rather than faces. “We hope people can meet under more honest or transparent circumstances with the help of the contents of the fridge, because that can tell you a lot about the personality,” a PR manager explained.

Speaking of transparent, Samsung didn’t launch this site for the love of matchmaking; it is a promotional tactic for its multi-thousand-pound smart fridges.

At this point I would like to point out that smart fridges are one of the stupidest things to come out of the modern world. It has been said cocaine is God’s way of telling you that you have too much money; I reckon internet-connected fridges are God’s way of telling you that you should be paying more taxes.

Despite my hatred for smart fridges, I selflessly joined Refrigerdating for research purposes. I soon learned that Cilla from Stockholm is into oat milk, Nico from Stockholm has a large eggplant and Patrick from Stockholm only eats condiments. Disappointingly, I didn’t match with anybody, which may be because there only seem to be about 15 users and they are probably all employees of Samsung Sweden. Nevertheless, I enjoyed peering into strangers’ fridges far more than I had anticipated.

Not to sound like a fridge fetishist, but Samsung is really on to something here; my gut says it should go further with the concept. How about an app that matches people based on their willingness to consume food with mould on it? It could be called Can You Stomach Me? and I think Theresa May, for one, would really be into it.",0.992,
110,Money,Five of the best top-end smartphones,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/feb/16/best-top-end-smartphones-mobile,2019-02-16T07:00:05Z,"There’s never been a better time to buy a top-of-the-line smartphone, with a large range of truly excellent phones available from a variety of different manufacturers starting at £500 and stretching to a wallet-busting £1,000-plus.

But with all that top-quality choice, it’s difficult to know which one to buy. Here’s a quick guide to get the best flagship phone for you right now.

The Chinese firm might be in the middle of a political storm, but that didn’t stop Huawei from producing the most cutting-edge, feature-packed phone of 2018: the Mate 20 Pro. Headline features include 3D IR-based (the most secure kind) face recognition matching the iPhone XS, a pressure-sensitive in-display fingerprint scanner and a brilliant triple-camera system on the back that is the best in the business.

If that wasn’t enough the Mate 20 Pro also has a huge and beautiful 6.38in OLED screen squeezed into a slim and curved body, which keeps the whole phone relatively easy to handle. Huawei’s own Kirin 980 processor matches or bests rivals, while a large battery means it running for close to two days.

When it does run out, it has really fast cable charging, fast wireless charging and it can even wirelessly charge another device with the flick of a switch.

If you’re going to blow the budget, this is the one to do it on, unless you’re an iPhone diehard.

The best iPhone available isn’t the most expensive, nor is it, sadly, the cheapest. The iPhone XS is the middle of the road with best combination of features, size and that premium feel that makes and iPhone special, which it has to have costing this much.

The 5.8in screen is stunning and both big enough for watching videos on the commute and small enough to easily hold and fit in your pocket. The dual camera system on the back is one of the best, the Face ID system works great (there’s no Touch ID or home button anymore) and Apple’s gesture navigation is the best in the business.

Performance is top-notch, but battery life is only about a day compared to almost two for competitors. It still has Apple’s Lightning connector, not the newer universal USB-C standard, but does have wireless charging and will get software support longer than any other phone here.

If you want an Apple smartphone, the iPhone XS is the best, but it costs a pretty penny.

OnePlus has made a name for itself by offering top phones that undercut the competition on price, and the latest OnePlus 6T is no exception.

For around half the cost of a Huawei Mate 20 Pro or an iPhone XS you get a phone that’s 90% as good. It has the big and beautiful 6.41in full HD+ OLED screen, slim bezels and a tiny notch for the selfie camera. It has a cutting-edge in-display fingerprint scanner. It even has Qualcomm’s top of the line processor and a battery that will last 1.5 days, plus super fast charging via cable.

OnePlus doesn’t skimp on the software either, with one of the best Android experiences you can get and three years of software updates from release. The only downsides are a camera that isn’t quite as good as the top-priced models, no wireless charging and not formal water resistance.

With a great Android experience second only to Google’s, good battery, top performance and a gorgeous screen, the OnePlus 6T is hard to beat for £500.

Until recently the OnePlus 6T was the king of the cut-price flagship. Now it has some real competition in the form of the Honor View20. Made by Huawei’s e-brand Honor, the View20 has a big, 6.4in full HD+ LCD screen that takes up the entire front with just a small hole in the top left corner for a selfie camera.

It also has good battery life, super fast charging, a premium feel, a great rear-mounted fingerprint scanner and the same processor as Huawei’s Mate 20 Pro making it fast and capable. On the back it has a new generation of 48-megapixel camera, which is really very good and a cut above the OnePlus 6T.

The Android software experience is solid, but not on the same level as the OnePlus, but you get a similar two to three years of updates from release. It’s even still got a headphone socket - a rarity in 2019.

If you want the best camera for under £500, the Honor View20 is a cracking performer that feels and operates like a phone that’s much more expensive.

As the Android-marker, the Pixel 3 is Google showing what can be done when you create both the hardware and software together, just as Apple does. And as a result it has the best, most polished Android experience going.

The hardware more or less matches the competition on specifications, but lacks any truly cutting-edge additions. Instead you get advanced software, a brilliant single camera and Android updates first with software support guaranteed through October 2021. Features such as Gmail’s Smart Compose are fun, while the recent update with Night Sight produces some amazing and unparalleled low-light images.

The downside is you have to put up with battery that doesn’t quite match up to the competition lasting only about a day, but at least it has fast cable and wireless charging. There’s a bigger sibling, the Pixel 3 XL, but the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is better all round at that size.

The Google Pixel 3 offers a first-class experience and is the best smaller Android phone currently available.

The runners up - watch out for deals

Samsung is due to replace the Galaxy S9 next week, but if you can find it for £400 or less it could be a good deal. The larger S9+ could also be a worth looking at.

The Galaxy Note 9 is Samsung’s huge, stylus-equipped productivity beast that’s overkill for most, but if you need a phone to do everything, this is it.

Huawei’s original hit, the P20 Pro is due to be replaced in the next couple of months, but is still a great phone with a camera that rivals the excellent one on the Mate 20 Pro and can be picked up for as little as £430. Dual-sim versions are available.

If you don’t want to spend £999 on the iPhone XS and the £749 iPhone XR just doesn’t cut it, Apple’s selling last year’s smash hit, the iPhone X for £769 refurbished. Check Apple’s online store for stock.

111,UK news,Alleged hacker who avoided extradition to US seeks return of computers,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/11/lauri-love-computer-activist-seeks-return-computers-extradition-us-nca,2019-02-11T18:26:27Z,"A computer activist who successfully resisted attempts to extradite him to the US over alleged hacking has applied for the return of his confiscated computers, after the National Crime Agency confirmed he is still under investigation.

Lauri Love, 34, requested several computers and the data on them be handed back.

His equipment was taken when he was first arrested under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 by the NCA at his home in Suffolk in 2013. He has continued to protest his innocence and has not been charged.

Love applied at Hendon magistrates court in north London for his possessions to be returned.

Love’s move to recover his computers follows a failed attempt last year to extradite him to the US to face prosecution for allegedly breaking into government agencies such as the Federal Reserve, the army, the US Department of Defense, Nasa and the FBI in a spate of online attacks in 2012 and 2013.

In the extradition hearing, the lord chief justice, Lord Burnett, and Mr Justice Ouseley said it would be “oppressive” to send him for trial in US courts because Love has Asperger syndrome and other health difficulties. He might either have been rendered suicidal or medically unfit to enter a plea, the judges concluded.

The high court also said: “It would not be oppressive to prosecute Mr Love in England for the offences alleged against him. Far from it. Much of Mr Love’s argument was based on the contention that this is indeed where he should be prosecuted.”

One year on, Love has not been charged with any computer hacking offences. He denies wrongdoing.

The district judge at Hendon, Margot Coleman, made an order that the hearing could be heard in public, but only limited details could be reported, such as the fact that the application had been made, what the application relates to and the outcome of the hearing.

She did, however, seek confirmation from the counsel for the NCA and allow reporting of the fact its investigation of Love is continuing.

His confiscated property was listed as a Fujitsu Siemens laptop, an Acer computer tower, a Compaq computer tower, a Samsung laptop and attachments, an SD card, a Western Digital hard drive and a hard drive fitted within a laptop.

The judge reserved judgment to 19 February at Westminster magistrates court.",0.8615,
112,UK news,"For Surrey’s Koreans, simmering tensions reflect the north-south divide at home",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/09/notebook-new-malden-korea-north-south-tension,2019-02-09T17:28:00Z,"In New Malden, the Surrey high street that stretches out from the railway station taking commuters to London Waterloo is filled with signs from another land. There are Korean restaurants and supermarkets, a Korean bakery and a Korean estate agent – even a Korean acupuncture centre. When Samsung established its first European HQ, this was where it set up. The population of this quiet suburb of south-west London, estimated at about 10,000, is almost one-third South Korean.

Recently, however, New Malden has emerged as the adopted home of another wave of immigrants from the Korean peninsula – those from north of the demilitarised zone. Enticed by job opportunities made easier by a shared language, the number of North Koreans living here has risen from only 20 in 2007 to about 800 today – the largest North Korean community in Europe.

But coexistence hasn’t been uncomplicated. As the number of North Koreans grew, they started to form their own community, separate from the already established South Koreans. And in recent years, some say the division between the two groups has resulted in the rise of low-level tensions.

“North and South Koreans associate with each other in professional settings but not much in informal social settings,” says Baek Jun-hwa, a leading member of the North Korean community in the UK. Baek, whose name has been changed, first came to New Malden in 2007, one of the first North Koreans to settle in the area. When he arrived, he worked in the warehouse of a South Korean supermarket, and has since become assistant manager at another one nearby.

Baek says that both South and North Koreans feel a certain level of discomfort towards each other. Despite efforts to foster closer ties, such as South Koreans inviting North Koreans to formal community events, many North Koreans are unwilling to attend.

“They say, why do we have to go there? North Koreans see events organised by the South Korean community as something that is not part of their community.”

Discrimination is another key flashpoint in the two groups’ often intertwined tensions. “Compared with South Korea, where North Koreans experience a lot of discrimination, the UK is much more of a level playing field as we are both foreigners in this country and in the eyes of the British people. We are both seen as just Koreans. But discrimination exists here too, and some South Koreans look down upon North Koreans,” says Baek.

“For instance, if there are 10 Korean children in one school and eight are from the South and two are from the North, the mothers of the eight South Korean children will drink tea with each other and have social gatherings. The mothers of the two North Korean mothers will not be able to participate. The South Korean mothers will not isolate the North Korean mothers deliberately, but what often happens is that North Koreans are seen as outcasts and are left out.”

Baek acknowledges that without the economic help of the South Korean community, such as providing jobs, the North Koreans would have never been able to establish a community of their own. But he believes the huge cultural differences that exist between South and North Korea, which have been separated for almost 70 years, acts as a barrier even in the UK. Since 1948, North Koreans have lived under the dictatorial regimes of the Kim dynasty, suffering poverty, repression and the long arm of a brutal police state. Since the 1980s, South Koreans, on the other hand, have watched their economy boom as the country embraced democracy and opened up to the rest of the world.

When people from the two countries find themselves face to face in New Malden, says Baek, they often don’t have much in the way of common ground, and dialogue is hindered as a result. “When South Koreans talk about their lives and experiences in South Korea,” he says, “North Koreans cannot join in the conversation because they don’t know what they [South Koreans] are talking about.”",-0.9285,
113,Technology,Honor View20 review: top phone at half the cost of an iPhone XS,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/01/honor-view-20-review-iphone-xs-48mp-camera-android,2019-02-01T06:00:47Z,"The Honor View20 made by Huawei, the Chinese manufacturer at the centre of a political storm, offers a top-notch experience including a great camera for £500 – less than half the price of an iPhone XS.

The company is at the centre of allegations of violating sanctions and theft of trade secrets, but it’s undeniable that it has produced some excellent phones at affordable prices over the last year. The View20 is Honor’s attempt to show that is has the beans to step out from the shadow of just being Huawei’s cheaper sub-brand with a top-flight phone of its own.

The all-screen front and a wild colour scheme on the back make the View20 an eye-catching device, but some might think the V-shaped light reflecting etching looks a little cheap.

The View20 is the first phone on the market to offer a so-called hole-punch notch - a small hole in the top left of the display through which the selfie camera pokes. That leaves the rest of the front, bar a small chin at the bottom, entirely dedicated to its massive 6.4in FHD+ LCD screen. It’s really quite impressive, and unlike some other notch designs, you quickly forget the little hole is there, particularly when playing video full-screen.

The display is good too, very bright and with excellent viewing angles. It’s not quite as vibrant and colour rich as some of the best OLED displays out there, but it’s really not that far off.

At 8.1mm thick, 75.4mm wide and 180g in weight, the View 20 is also fairly light, slim and manageable for a phone with such a large screen, coming in 5g lighter than the OnePlus 6T and 2mm narrower and 28g lighter than the iPhone XS Max. The curvature of the glass back and metal edges aid your grip considerably compared with some of the flatter competition.

The bottom of the phone has an average down-firing speaker and USB-C port for power and connectivity, while the top has a headphone socket – a real rarity in 2019.
• None Connectivity: headphone socket, LTE, wifi, NFC, Bluetooth 5 and GPS (dual-sim available in some regions)

The Honor View20 has the same processor as Huawei’s current king the Mate 20 Pro, and an option of either 6GB or 8GB of RAM. As such it is fast, powerful and snappy all round, matching the best of the rest powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845, even in gaming.

Battery life is also good, but not quite class leading, lasting about 31 hours between charges.

Starting at 7am on day one, it would easily last until lunch on the second day, dying at about 2pm, meaning it would make it through even the heaviest of days and nights out without battery anxiety.

The View20 lacks wireless charging, but hits 100% from dead in about 100 minutes, with 60% reached in just 30 minutes, making it one of the fastest charging phones available.

Call quality, even with the tiny speaker right on the top of the phone, was excellent. The View20 was also able to get a usable 4G data connection in more places than rivals, similar to the Mate 20 Pro.

The View20 is one of Honor’s first phones with its new Magic UI 2 software, which is the manufacturer’s version of Android 9 Pie.

While Honor says that it will differentiate Magic UI over time, right now it is essentially Huawei’s EMUI, as seen on the Mate 20 Pro, but with a new name.

As such it is a bit like Marmite. Some are going to love it, others will hate it and wish it ran a more Google-like version of Android. For instance, it comes out of the box with icons for every app on the homescreen mirroring Apple’s iOS. There is an option to enable the more traditional Android app drawer, but it comes with an old-school button rather than the more modern swiping gesture to open it.

You also get the option of the traditional three-button navigation keys, a joystick-like navigation dock and gesture navigation, which is good but lacks a way to quickly jump to a previously used app.

Aesthetically Magic UI isn’t as attractive or modern-looking as Android on the Pixel 3 or OnePlus 6T, but it supports full system themes and has added power-saving features that can extend battery life dramatically if needed.

Honor promises to deliver two Android major version updates and small updates as and when required for the View20.

The big fingerprint scanner on the back is well placed, accurate and very fast indeed – easily one of the best on the market.

The View20 also has camera-based 2D face unlock, which is also very fast in all but poor lighting conditions, but is potentially less secure, particularly compared with more sophisticated 3D face recognition as found on the Mate 20 Pro or latest iPhones.

The camera has been Honor’s biggest weak point in the past, but not any more.

The View20 has one of the best cameras available at any price point. The new 48-megapixel camera – one of the first on the market – is paired with a secondary sensor, which is used to capture depth information for portrait mode and other bits.

While more megapixels doesn’t necessarily mean better photos, Honor’s camera is genuinely better. By default it shoots 12-megapixel images, combining four pixels from the camera’s sensor into one for the photo. That helps remove artefacts and boosts low-light performance.

Photos come out looking richly detailed, well coloured and simply blowing most of the View20’s competition out of the water. Low light performance is also excellent without using the special Night mode, which didn’t appear to improve much when activated. Even the zoom, which is 2x lossless then up to 10x digital zoom, matches some of the best from Apple and Huawei.

Alongside the 12-megapixel shooting mode there’s the option to turn on Honor’s AI Ultra Clarity mode that shoots full 48-megapixel photos by combining a series of frames into one image. It only really works well in medium to good lighting conditions outside and it takes several second of holding the phone steady, but the images it produces are fantastic. They capture a level of detail only achieved through zooming, but across a full wide-angle image. Great fun.

The camera app is good too, and there are plenty of modes to have fun with, including a Pro mode for shooting in RAW, 960 frames-per-second slow motion video and a reasonable portrait mode, which can only be used when the camera can detect a face.

Honor’s AI photography system is also much improved over previous versions, reducing the highly oversaturated images it used to produce. I still prefer to make adjustments to colour and contrast manually, but it didn’t totally ruin photos as it has before and I think most will probably just leave it on now. I still wish there was a quick toggle for HDR mode, rather than having to tap through a menu to activate it.

The 25-megapixel selfie camera, which pokes through the hole in the screen, is really good too. It captures a great amount of detail, but there’s a surprisingly good skin-smoothing beauty mode if images filled with every fine line and pore aren’t to your taste.
• None The notch obscures the time in the left corner when using Android Auto on the phone
• None There’s a tiny amount of uneven backlighting at the very bottom of the screen, which almost looks like shadow from the bezel
• None Sometimes the three navigation buttons were shunted slightly off to the left of the centre when held in portrait orientation
• None Honor has included a very useful button on the navigation bar to rotate the screen when you have auto-rotation disabled (as I have all the time)
• None The View20 is one of the first three Android phones to support Fornite at 60fps

The Honor View20 costs £500 with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or £580 with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, available in four colours.

For comparison, the 128GB Huawei Mate 20 Pro costs £900, the Google Pixel 3 XL costs £869 with 64GB, the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 costs £899 with 128GB, 64GB iPhone XR costs £749 and the OnePlus 6T costs £499.

The Honor View20 is genuinely brilliant phone that gives the very best in the market a run for their money. But then you realise that it costs half as much as an iPhone XS and is a full £400 cheaper than Huawei’s Mate 20 Pro.

At £500 the Honor View20 is an absolute bargain. It’s fast, lasts a long time, looks good, feels great and fits a giant screen in a still-manageable body. Its rear-mounted fingerprint sensor is really good, but not quite cutting edge. It is the first phone out of the gate with a hole-punch notch, which is a marked improvement on other notch designs, and it’s even still got a headphone socket.

Much of this matches the other flagship bargain, the OnePlus 6T, but where the View20 is unrivalled is its camera, which is as good as the most expensive phones out there and blows the competition out of the water.

The software might not be to everyone’s taste, but it’s relatively adaptable and easy to live with. The LCD screen is inferior to a good OLED screen, but whether anyone will really notice or care is debatable.

It’s not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, but if you want a big, top-end phone with a cracking camera at a much more affordable price the Honor View20 is it.

114,Technology,Can I buy a monitor for photo editing that shows colour like print?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/jan/24/can-i-buy-a-monitor-for-photo-editing-that-shows-colour-like-print,2019-01-24T08:00:00Z,"Sad to say, prints can never look like screen images. Screens are bright and display colours using combinations of red, green and blue pixels (RGB). Prints don’t light up so they can’t have the same brightness or contrast range, and they’re printed using cyan, yellow, magenta and black inks (CMYK).

Colours are also affected by the light under which you view things, which is why smart buyers take clothes and materials to shop doorways to see what the colours look like in daylight. Do you do the same thing when viewing prints? A print viewed under warm room lighting should not look the same as it does on a monitor set to the standard daylight colour temperature of 6500K, even though your brain will automatically try to compensate for the difference.

Nonetheless, photographers can learn from experience of how colours are going to be reproduced, as long as the process is consistent. I was obliged to do this in the days before personal computing, when I edited photography magazines. Today’s DSLR cameras produce images that are much like the colour slides we used to view on lightboxes, so happily this skill has transferred. However, the more variables you can eliminate, the better your guesses should be. This is where colour gamuts, screen calibration, printer profiles and, yes, standard light sources can help.

There should be a way to get the screen image closer to the print, but it would be quite a lot of work, expensive, and you probably won’t like it. First, get a calibration device such as an X-Rite i1 Display Pro (£178) or a Datacolor’s Spyder5 Elite (also £178). Next, calibrate your monitor to match the printer and paper you’re using. In other words, adjust the screen display so that the white matches the white of your paper, and the black matches the maximum black that ink can produce on that particular paper.

It’s better to print a colour patch or test card, rather than a naturalistic image where the brain can interfere with the colour rendering. Fujifilm has a good composite test card.

I’ve never actually tried this, but I imagine the monitor display would be disappointing. You’d have reduced the brightness and contrast range, and most people like bright, contrasty screens.

I’m also not sure how well this would work when using an online printer rather than your own ink-jet. If they do their own colour profiling, their software might try to compensate for yours. You could certainly ask if their printer will respect your colour management profiles (there are “preserve embedded profiles” settings for RGB and CMYK in Adobe Photoshop), but affordable colour printing is based on a high level of automation.

If your monitor produces accurate colour and the printer produces accurate colour, then the results ought to be predictable, even though the images are not identical. This is the device-independent solution that underlies the traditional answer, which is to buy a monitor with an accurate colour profile. The main ones are standard sRGB and Adobe RGB. Of course, for this to work, the whole reproduction chain must follow the same standard.

The argument for using Adobe RGB is that it’s wider and includes most of the colours that a CMYK printer can print. That should be better. The argument for using 8-bit sRGB is that practically every device supports it well, and some devices don’t support anything else.

If you’re producing images for internet distribution and on-screen viewing, I think you are better off sticking to sRGB. If you’re producing images for some form of printing, there’s an argument for using Adobe RGB, as long as you can be sure it will be printed that way. You’d have to check this with your online printing service. The websites I looked at all requested sRGB.

Another advantage of using sRGB is that it sets a lower standard that cheap monitors can meet, though better Adobe RGB scores generally indicate a better quality monitor.

In passing, “the whole chain” ought to include the camera, and you can set some (most?) serious cameras – including my own Nikon D7500 – to produce Jpeg images to either sRGB or Adobe RGB standards. This doesn’t mean the colours will be accurate: most cameras give pictures a pleasantly warm boost. (You may be able to check the accuracy of your camera’s colour rendering by searching for the product name at imaging-resource.com.) However, the setting makes no difference if you work from RAW files, which can capture more colours than any colour gamut can handle, including Kodak’s ProPhoto RGB.

Rtings.com keeps a list of The Five Best Monitors for Photo Editing, based on its thorough tests. The Quad HD/2K Dell U2518D is the only one in your price range at £284.49, because it has been discounted from £599. Rtings notes that it “doesn’t cover the Adobe RGB color space very well,” which is something to consider if you plan to use that. (I’m quoting Amazon prices for convenience but you can shop around for better deals.)

Monitors designed for photographers tend to be outrageously expensive, but BenQ offers the 24in SW240 PhotoVue for only £399. It claims “99% Adobe RGB coverage [and] hardware calibration support for accurate colours”. The obvious drawback is the 1920 x 1200 resolution, and the ViewSonic VP2468 seems to offer the same features for only £214.41.

BenQ’s PD2700Q Designer Monitor would get you a 27in screen with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels for £289.98, which is almost the same price as Dell’s 25in U2518D. But anyone looking for a cheap QHD screen could check out the 24in L24q-10 currently on Lenovo’s website for £179.99, or at PC World for £179.

The QHD/2K resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels is now the sweet spot for most applications, including gaming. However, if you use Photoshop to edit 5568 x 3712-pixel or similar images, I’d save up for Rtings’ top pick, the LG 27UK650-W. This is a 27in 4K (3840 x 2160) monitor for £459.99. Alternatively, the LG 27UK600 has the same panel without the built-in speakers or the adjustable stand for £404.99.

It’s well over budget, but you could spend several hours a day looking at it for the next five years, or more. The price difference is only £30 a year.

DisplayMate Technologies is an industry leader in the business of evaluating, calibrating and optimising displays, and Raymond Soneira – founder, president and CEO – benchmarks some flagship products for colour accuracy. His tests show that the Apple iPhone X and XS Max, Google’s Pixel 3 XL and Samsung’s Galaxy S9 and Note 9 smartphones “all provide close to textbook perfect calibration accuracy and performance that is visually indistinguishable from perfect”. They’re almost certainly better than any TV or monitor you own.

Colour-accurate tablets include the Samsung Galaxy Tab S and the Apple iPad Pro 9.7 (2016). The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 also impressed: it was the best ever tablet display when tested, though since surpassed.

Today, the simplest way to check a photo’s colour rendering is to view it on one of DisplayMate’s top-rated smartphones or tablets, preferably on an OLED or AMOLED screen. This is great news if you already own one, but not a cheap option if you don’t.

115,News,Ion age: why the future will be battery powered,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/14/on-the-charge-why-batteries-are-the-future-of-clean-energy,2019-01-14T07:00:31Z,"Why have batteries become important?

In a world increasingly anxious about climate change, the surge in the generation of renewable energy over the past 20 years offers a sliver of hope. But the variable nature of wind and solar power means that storing energy until consumers need it has become the next big challenge. And so, large-scale battery installations are springing up across electricity grids around the world, to make them more flexible. In 2017, more than 1GW of power storage capacity was added around the world – a record, yes, but still a drop in the ocean of global energy demand.

How do batteries like this work?

Of course, we are not talking about a few AAA batteries here. And yet, all batteries broadly work in a similar manner.

Electrical energy is converted to chemical energy when you charge a battery, and then the process is reversed when you draw power from it.

There are three main constituents of most batteries: two electrodes and some form of chemical medium called the electrolyte, which can be a liquid, gel or solid. To generate electricity, a chemical reaction takes place that sees electrons move from the negative electrode, called the anode, to the positive electrode, called the cathode.

When you charge the battery, the process is reversed, sending electrons back to the anode.

So how many of these big batteries are there?

There is around 500MW of large-scale battery power installed around the UK, a figure that is expected to double within three years, according to the analysts Aurora Energy Research. Almost all capacity uses lithium-ion.

Globally installed power is expected to top 50GW by 2020 – and surge to almost 1,000GW by 2040, according to Bloomberg NEF. That would equate to about 7% of the world’s energy capacity.

How do batteries fit in to the renewables revolution?

In the UK, battery installations are primarily being deployed to supply services to National Grid. Such ancillary services are increasingly important to help match supply and demand as a growing amount of intermittent wind and solar power comes online.

There are also the beginnings of “hybrid” renewable energy power plants, where batteries are installed alongside solar farms and windfarms. This is particularly important for the economics of solar farms, which can push down power prices around midday by peaking at the same time. Instead of exporting immediately, hybrid farms can store power to sell later at higher prices.

In other parts of the world, such as South Australia, batteries are being used to make the grid more resilient and avoid blackouts. Crucially, batteries are not yet suitable and do not make economic sense for interseasonal storage – that is, storing up solar power in summer to release in winter.

Will we all have big household batteries in the future?

Elon Musk may have popularised the concept of a home battery when he unveiled Tesla’s version three years ago, but the firm was not the first and is not the biggest in this field. Such batteries, which are about the size of a gas boiler, can store and release electricity either generated by a household or imported from the grid.

The German firm Sonnen, which has around a 25% global market share in home batteries, said most customers today are people who have solar panels or live in storm-hit regions and want a clean, reliable backup source of power. “The market is still in the very, very early phase,” says the chief executive, Christoph Ostermann. Germany, Italy, Australia and the US states of California and Hawaii are the biggest markets so far.

For solar households, it makes more financial sense to store and consume the energy rather than be paid for exporting it to the grid. In future, as more time-of-use energy tariffs emerge, there might also be enough of an incentive to install one to avoid peak pricing.

However, for Ostermann, the most exciting prospect is harnessing thousands of the batteries as a “virtual power plant”. He describes this as an “Uberisation” of batteries that the company does not own but can call on, with permission. “We are not heading for utility scale, but virtual power plants can provide significant power,” he says.

We are just beginning to see the second generation of battery-powered vehicles, according to the entrepreneur Henrik Fisker, the founder of the electric car maker Fisker Inc. He views affordability and a decent range between charges as this crop’s defining features.

While the first models, with the exception of Tesla, could manage around 100 miles, most new ones now offer between 200-300 miles. “I see the market starting to boom around 2020 or 2021, as there is more choice [of models],” says Fisker.

Fisker also views ultrafast charging as vital to helping electric cars go mainstream. While a typical home will take about 8-10 hours to fully top up a car (with a 3KW socket), some new public chargers can do that in about 10 minutes (using a 350KW charger).



What about other modes of transport?

Electric double-decker buses, built by the Chinese manufacturer BYD, already ply the streets of London. Elon Musk has announced plans for an electric truck.

But the energy density required for heavy transport makes it a lot harder for batteries to beat fossil fuels. “It’s definitely more challenging,” says Prof Paul Shearing, the Royal Academy of Engineering’s chair in emerging battery technologies. “[But] I think the future is going to be electric, no matter which way you cut it.”

Will we all be flying around in electric jumbo jets soon? “Not yet,” says Shearing, who adds that energy density and weight of batteries meant there would probably only be used in unmanned aerial vehicles in the short term. “I think it’ll be a long time until we see an electric passenger plane,” he says.

What is the environmental and social impact of making batteries?

A key element in lithium-ion batteries is cobalt, despite manufacturers’ attempt to reduce the amount required. More than 60% world’s cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where concerns have been raised about the social and environmental impact of mining the metal.

The lithium in the batteries comes mainly from three big producer countries, Australia, Argentina and Chile, along with emerging producers such as Bolivia, Brazil, Canada and Zimbabwe. Water consumption and scarcity in some producer countries is the big concern here. “There are definite ethics issues. Large companies are going to be driven by cost,” says Shearing, of cobalt and lithium production.

What happens to the batteries towards the end of their life is also a big challenge. Dr Jonathan Radcliffe, of the school of chemical engineering at the University of Birmingham, is worried about the fate of batteries when their performance in today’s crop of electric vehicles is no longer good enough for cars. Some now have a second life as a home battery, but he fears the market could be saturated in a few years, undermining the financial case for reuse.

“The risk is that there is no viable second-use in the UK and we have a large amount of battery waste, without the processes in place to deal with it,” he says.

The bigger and denser the battery, the more chemical energy it can store and therefore the more electricity it can generate. But a bigger, denser battery is more expensive, heavier, takes longer to charge and has more potential for destruction if things go wrong.

The chemistry and internal construction of the battery also plays a role in how much energy it can store. Lithium-based batteries are popular because they have a relatively high energy-to-weight ratio and maintain their charge well when not in use.

In most devices, battery life is a trade-off between physical size, design, energy density and safety, alongside the energy efficiency of the device it powers.

What about phone batteries – why do they deteriorate as they get old?

Most batteries can only maintain their full capacity for a finite time and number of charge and discharge cycles. The exact process of battery ageing is still a hot research topic, but there are several mechanisms at play that occur when the battery is used or stored.

The most common is the build-up of material on the anode, which slowly gets deposited when the battery is used or stored. A similar oxidation can also occur on the cathode, while the active ingredients of the battery can react and degrade over time. A combination of these effects reduce the amount of lithium ions and active material available for storing electricity, therefore reducing maximum capacity.

But the internal resistance of the battery can also increase as it ages, meaning its peak power output is lower, a process that causes issues in iPhones.

How a battery is used and stored can dramatically affect its ageing. For instance, batteries can be damaged by exposing them to extremes of temperature, which is more problematic for a car or similar than a smartphone.

Rapid cycling of the battery also increases wear, particularly if the power demands on the battery are very high, as is the case with electric cars. Charging and using the battery to its extremes also accelerates ageing, such as charging batteries to their maximum and discharging them to zero.

What happens when things go wrong?

Safety was thrown into the spotlight when some of the batteries inside the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 developed a fault that caused them to short circuit and catch fire.

When something disrupts the chemical reaction inside the battery, it can cause “thermal runaway”, where uncontrolled reactions chain together, generating too much heat, typically resulting in batteries bursting or catching fire.

Various safety mechanisms, both electrical control circuits and physical measures including shielding and battery structure, mean such events are rare. But they are of particular concern for portable devices, which are often held on a person, and electric vehicles that may be involved in a collision that could damage the integrity of the battery.

Companies are working hard to increase the amount of energy that can be packed into a battery, and to bring down the cost of making them.

Future prices are unlikely to fall as fast as they have in the past, says Ostermann, because reductions have already been so rapid. Sonnen has seen prices fall from more than €1,000 (£905) per kilowatt hour of energy capacity when it started in 2010, to about €150-200 per kWh today. But the company expects to cut costs in electronics such as inverters.

New wonder materials will take a while to break through, Shearing says. “The next 10 years are going to continue to be lithium-ion dominated. It’s taken a long time to get to this productivity and technological maturity level. For anything to catch up will take a while.”

Most innovation will be around lithium-ion, he believes, such as improving the energy density and lowering costs by reducing the amount of cobalt in a battery. The rate at which batteries can take on a charge will also improve, Shearing adds.

Radcliffe agrees that lithium-ion will continue to dominate. Cost and performance will improve, driven by the scale-up of manufacturing and continued research, he says.

Batteries will also be put to new uses. Fisker says that as technology improves, he expects to see them eventually appear on construction sites, in mines and in industrial equipment, replacing diesel generators. They will be deployed in increasingly small devices, such as medical implants, Shearing says.

The Numi 2.0 Intelligent Toilet promises a “fully immersive experience” with fancy “dynamic and interactive multicoloured ambient and surround lighting”, built-in speakers and voice control. A snip at about $7,000 – or $9,000 if you want it in black.

“Alexa, flush for me.” What could possibly go wrong?

What if your smartwatch used you as a human battery so it never needs charging? That’s precisely what the Matrix PowerWatch 2 promises, sucking heat from the wearer’s skin to generate electricity, alongside a hidden solar panel for good measure.

The watch is water-resistant to 200m, has a colour screen, shows notifications and will track steps, sleep and health with a heart rate monitor on the back and GPS for runners. It’s compatible with iPhone and Android, selling through the crowdfunding site Indiegogo for $199-$395, to ship in June.

Electronic gadgets come in many forms, including tools for pleasure. Although not, apparently, at CES when developed by an almost all-female team using patent-pending technology in micro-robotics, biomimicry and engineering.

Osé, an intimate massager that “mimics all of the sensations of a human mouth, tongue and fingers” to feel “just like a real partner”, was originally selected as a CES 2019 Innovation Award honouree but was then dumped and banned from the show for being “immoral, obscene, indecent, profane”.

CES’s organisers are now facing accusations of gender bias, given sex dolls for men were launched at the event last year and pornography has been featured in its virtual reality booths for years.

Apple, notorious for blocking others from using its technology, has not only started licensing its AirPlay 2 media streaming system to TV manufacturers including Sony, LG and Vizio, but has also announced that an iTunes app will be available on its arch-rival Samsung’s smart TVs.

Expect an Apple TV streaming service to launch this year, then.

The Korean car company Hyundai has unveiled a car that can walk. The Elevate is capable of both “mammalian and reptilian walking gaits” using four articulated robotic legs that extend out from traditional wheel arches but that can fold back down and drive like a regular car.

At least that’s the theory. Experts are sceptical that Hyundai’s “limitless” design will actually work. But if it does, the car that “can climb a 5ft wall, step over a 5ft gap, walk over diverse terrain and achieve a 15ft wide track width” will apparently be brilliant for emergency services and rescue vehicles.

Not everything at CES requires electricity. Impossible Food launched the second iteration of its meat-free Impossible Burger. It claims its soy-based meat substitute looks, tastes and feels like a beef patty; it even “bleeds” and was convincing enough to make one vegetarian reviewer heave.

The Impossible Burger 2.0 “delivers all the taste meat lovers crave – without compromise to nutrition or the planet”, according to the company’s COO, David Lee. It is now on sale in a few fast food restaurants in Las Vegas, with a US rollout scheduled for later in the year.

Have you ever wished for a Nespresso machine but for beer? LG’s HomeBrew might be the answer to your prayers.

Pop in one big and three smaller Nespresso-esque capsules and hit the button. The HomeBrew will then produce five litres of beer from a choice of American IPA, American pale ale, stout, pilsner and Belgian witbier. It even cleans itself at the end.

The catch? It takes two weeks to brew ...

Bose, maker of world-class noise cancelling headphones, wants to make car journeys silent, using the vehicle’s speakers. Its QuietComfort Road Noise Control system aims to suppress road noise, using a series of accelerometers and microphones to cancel out unwanted sound waves using the vehicle’s sound system.

Conventional systems simply pack the doors and floor with insulation but the problem is much bigger for electric cars, which lack the ambient sound of a combustion engine to mask the irritating roar of rubber on road.

Science fiction has long been filled with gadgets that automatically apply makeup. At CES, Procter & Gamble turned sci-fi into reality with a wand that scans the face and then precisely applies makeup.

The Opté Precision Skincare System detects the colour and pigment of skin using a camera, detects blemishes and then covers them with the exact amount of makeup needed to seamlessly erase them. The system prints makeup on to the skin using tiny inkjet-like nozzles.

118,Technology,Fall of the iCurtain: Apple brings iTunes to Samsung smart TVs,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/08/fall-icurtain-apple-itunes-samsung-smart-tv,2019-01-08T14:17:49Z,"Apple has announced that iTunes films will be available on Samsung smart TVs, ending the company’s insistence that users buy an Apple TV to watch their purchases on a big screen.

Fifteen years after Steve Jobs launched iTunes for Windows, quipping that he was “giving a glass of ice water to somebody in hell”, the move signals a wider opening up of the Apple ecosystem, with TV manufacturers including Sony, LG and Vizio announcing integration with Apple’s AirPlay 2 streaming technology, to allow users to broadcast from their phones or tablets directly to their televisions.

Apple’s senior vice-president of internet software and services, Eddy Cue, said: “We look forward to bringing the iTunes and AirPlay 2 experience to even more customers around the world through Samsung smart TVs, so iPhone, iPad and Mac users have yet another way to enjoy all their favourite content on the biggest screen in their home.”

The news follows an unexpected profit warning from Apple, which blamed a slowdown in China for a $5bn (£4bn) reduction in the company’s expected revenue, as worldwide predictions showed customers are likely to purchase fewer iPhones, Macs and iPads than previous estimates had suggested.

After that warning, which wiped 7.5% off the company’s shares, Apple told investors that one ray of light was the company’s services division, which includes revenue from the App Store, iCloud online services, and Apple Music and the iTunes stores.

“Revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19% year over year, including all-time record revenue from services, wearables and Mac,” wrote the chief executive, Tim Cook, in a letter to shareholders.

“Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales.

“Services generated over $10.8bn in revenues during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.”

By bringing iTunes to TVs made by competitors, Apple is hoping it can grow services revenue without harming device revenue from top-tier product lines.

The Apple TV, sales of which are likely to be dented by the shift, has not been particularly profitable, with the £179 device viewed as overpriced compared with similar offerings from Amazon, Roku and Google.

The iTunes and Samsung tie-up has reignited speculation that Apple is preparing to launch a Netflix competitor, either by bundling in a new TV streaming service with its Apple Music platform, or by combining both features with its wider iCloud service, which offers online storage and syncing to owners of the company’s hardware products.

The service is expected to launch in the US in the next few months, expanding rapidly to more than 100 countries, according to the tech news site The Information.

The company had a reported $1bn budget for original content last year, and has a few original shows available for Apple Music subscribers, including James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke, and Planet of the Apps, a Dragons’ Den-style programme in which budding developers pitch their software to Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Alba, will.i.am and the YouTuber Gary Vaynerchuk.",0.946,
119,Technology,"To woo China, Apple must learn that it’s not in California any more",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/06/apple-woo-china-not-in-california-iphone,2019-01-06T07:00:06Z,"After years of boom, Apple looks set for a rockier road in 2019 – partly through faults of its own and partly through social and economic factors that are affecting all the big smartphone manufacturers.

The company’s chief executive, Tim Cook, laid the blame for a shock cut in sales forecasts – and the subsequent share price tumble – on the economic downturn in China. A convenient excuse, but far from the whole picture.

The root of Apple’s troubles is that its key developed markets, including the US, EU and South Korea, have all hit smartphone saturation point. With few first-time buyers left, sales rely on persuading those with often perfectly usable phones to upgrade, which is a much harder task.

Users are now holding on to their phones for as long as three or four years, meaning something has to change. While maintaining competitive products to keep rivals at bay, you either have to launch something radically different (an incredibly hard task), push the price of your phones up, seek out still-growing markets or shift to a services-based revenue stream to wring more money out of existing users (think the App Store, Apple Pay, iCloud storage, Apple Music and the like).

Apple is doing all of the above. The trouble is that two of these strategies clash. By jacking up the cost of its best handsets to £1,000 or more, it has effectively priced itself out of the mass market in India, leaving China as its only hope of significant growth in sales volume and users. But China is different from Apple’s tried-and-tested markets.

When your lives are run through an app that is device- and platform-agnostic, then the brand and operating system of the phone does not matter. The playing field is levelled, and there is no customer lock-in provided by exclusive services such as iMessage or Apple Pay. That is Apple’s problem in China, where WeChat serves as the app not only for chat, but also for access to the government and news, conducting business, hiring cabs and purchasing goods.

When rivals are releasing phones of similar quality and at significantly cheaper prices, then Apple asking as much as £1,000 or more for its top products is hard to swallow in the west, let alone in China.

Furthermore, Apple is doing the right thing by its customers by offering cost-effective battery replacements and software support that lasts up to five years. That, combined with high prices, risks encouraging buyers to hang on to their old handsets for longer.

That’s not to say Apple isn’t in a good position. Its services push is providing meaningful revenue that almost matched that from Mac desktop and iPad sales combined in 2018. However, services revenue does need to become a priority sooner than the company might have anticipated: it faces stiff competition from Google, Spotify and others even on its own phones. Selling accessories such as the Apple Watch, Beats headphones and AirPods – meaning it can earn money outside the iPhone upgrade cycle – is also a smart move.

The trouble is that the recorded 59% of Apple revenue driven directly by iPhone sales hides the fact that its services revenue also overwhelmingly relies on the iPhone as the conduit. So while Apple must seek to extend sales as much as possible, it’s critical for it to maintain its current 1.3-billion-plus user base if services are to become the main driver of revenue.

The road will certainly be rocky for Apple over the next few years, with choices to be made over strategy and pricing for developing markets that seem to be at odds with its approach in developed markets. And all bets are off if we sink into a US-China trade war.

But away from direct sales, it stands in a stronger position than its rivals, including Samsung and Huawei. None of the major manufacturers have as many lines of service revenue as Apple; the lion’s share of the money from digital goods on Android smartphones outside of China goes to Google, not the phone makers.

Fat Cat Friday was an attempt by the High Pay Centre to publicise the shocking gap between the pay of the average chief executive and the average worker.

Top bosses, it found, earn 133 times more than their staff. To achieve this, the average FTSE 100 chief executive is paid £1,020 per hour, or £3.9m a year – and needs only three working days to reach the average annual worker’s pay of £29,574.

The TUC was naturally enraged by the findings, but the free-market thinktank, the Institute of Economic Affairs, was among a small band to cry foul.

Mark Littlewood, the IEA’s boss, argued that FTSE 100 bosses added hundreds of millions of pounds worth of value, making them cheap at the price. The example he gave, Terry Leahy, is flawed though. The former Tesco boss certainly expanded the supermarket hugely, but at the end of his tenure he took his eye off the ball in the crucial UK market and he also left the company nursing a £1bn loss from a failed expansion into the US.

The Adam Smith Institute also weighed in to the argument, arguing that pay campaigners would be better off focusing on improving productivity – or the amount of output generated per worker – as a driving force for raising workers’ wages and thus reducing the pay disparity between the factory floor and the boardroom.

However, there are no signs that giving chief executives an increase in pay of 11% last year – compared with 3% for the average worker – has resulted in bosses improving the productivity of their businesses.

Indeed, such glaring pay inequality could be viewed as demotivating for staff and thus damaging to worker output. A culture of teamwork brings more sustainable profits, not a maverick boss riding the waves of economic boom and bust.

Even online retailers will find it hard to survive

The Christmas trading news from John Lewis and Next last week showed that a final dash for presents by shoppers helped deliver a festive season that was not as bad as feared for two of the high street’s biggest names.

The relatively good news for those two high street stalwarts and the absence of a profit warning from Debenhams or other under-pressure chains like M&S have lifted hopes as more than 20 retailers prepare to report on festive trading in the coming week.

But hold the party poppers. Next’s high-street stores had a dismal time and the group’s profitability is being gradually squeezed by the shift to servicing online shoppers.

John Lewis’s profits are similarly under pressure as it battles to maintain its service culture and its “never knowingly undersold” price promise amid huge discounting by ailing rivals and rising costs.

Investment in web operations has never been so crucial to the survival of clothing, homewares and beauty retailers, where the shift from the high street has stepped up. Nearly a quarter of all fashion is now bought online.

Brexit uncertainty will keep a dampener on non-essential spending so traditional retailers face a high-wire walk between investing to survive and finding cost savings that will protect profits.

But even new online brands are not finding life easy.

According to accounts filed on Friday, young fashion website Missguided crashed to a £46m pretax loss in the year to last April – up from just £1.6m a year before – as it admitted it had got products wrong. Trendy web-slipper seller Mahabis called in administrators last week. Even Asos, the banner carrier of the new retail economy, shocked the City with a profits warning before Christmas.

Selling online is only part of the answer. These tough times will weed out sloppy retailers not offering value in terms of service, price or creative, differentiated products.",0.9892,
120,Technology,iPhone slump: the rivals taking a bite out of Apple,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/03/iphone-slump-the-rivals-taking-a-bite-out-of-apple,2019-01-03T12:52:26Z,"As Apple’s shares tumble after its cut in forecasts, the company is laying the blame squarely on the economic slowdown in China. But that is only part of the problem.

Never before has Apple faced such fierce competition from a multitude of rivals from around the globe, all vying for a slice of the lucrative premium smartphone market. Matching or exceeding Apple’s iPhone on hardware quality, these phones are arguably more capable, often cheaper and, perhaps crucially for China, made by local firms, not only those from the US and South Korea.

The iPhone X broke the mould in 2017 but 2018’s iPhone XS and XS Max, while very good phones, were only iterative improvements even though Apple pushed the top asking prices to an extraordinary £1,449 in the UK, $1,449 (£1,152) in the US and 12,799 yuan (£1,480) in China.

The firm also launched a lower cost iPhone XR, which had the same processor and overall design of the iPhone XS, but dropped the quality of the screen, the materials used in its body and the dual camera system on the back for £749 in the UK, $749 in the US and 6,499 yuan in China.

The iPhone’s biggest – and sometimes better – rivals are:

The top of the pile for 2018 comes not from Samsung or Apple but China’s Huawei, which overtook the iPhone maker to become the second largest smartphone manufacturer by volume in the world.

The Mate 20 Pro is something rather special, combining more cutting-edge technology than any other into a well-rounded, long-lasting, beautiful device.

It has a huge curved 6.39in OLED display, IR-based face recognition matching that available on the iPhone, a fingerprint scanner embedded under the display, and a fantastic triple-camera system on the back and battery life near double the competition. It can even wirelessly charge another device, a trick never before seen on any smartphone.

While certainly not cheap, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro also undercut both Apple’s top models – costing £900 in the UK and 6,799 yuan in China. The Mate 20 Pro is not available in the US.

The perennial thorn in Apple’s side in its battle for domination of the market since 2010, Samsung’s latest is a different beast.

The Galaxy Note 9 has the pre-requisite massive 6.4in OLED display, top of the line processor, wireless charging and a dual camera on the back. But it also has a powerful stylus that slots into the bottom of the phone and sets it apart from anything else, making it a real productivity powerhouse.

You can draw, annotate, sign and handwrite on the large screen, and even use the stylus’s button as a remote control for things such as the camera, for the perfect hands-free selfie.

The Note 9 is the do-anything phone and it costs £899 or less in the UK, $999 in the US and 6,999 yuan in China.

The third iteration of the Android maker’s own-brand smartphone, the Pixel 3 and 3 XL offer Google’s vision of what the software on a phone should be.

In the same way Apple makes both the hardware and software, the Pixel 3 benefits from Google’s synergy to create an Android experience that is second to none. It may not have all the whizz-bang features of rivals, and may have a fairly dated screen design, but its AI smarts and gamechanging camera software offer something different.

The smaller Pixel 3 costs £739 in the UK, $799 in the US and is available in China from around 7,400 yuan.
• None Google Pixel 3 review: raising the bar for the Android experience 5/5

High-cost rivals to Apple’s iPhone are one thing but there are also phones such as the brilliant OnePlus 6T that offer cutting-edge technology and great software at literally half the cost.

The OnePlus 6T is a very fast, high-performing phone with top-of-the-line processor, a massive, beautiful 6.41in OLED display and excellent battery life. But it also has a tiny teardrop-shaped notch that makes the giant bar-shaped notch of the iPhone XS and Mate 20 Pro look stupid and an impressive in-display fingerprint scanner.

The dual camera on the back is not quite as good and there is no wireless charging but the OnePlus 6T costs only £500 in the UK, $549 in the US and 3,499 yuan in China.
• None OnePlus 6T review: you’d have to spend double to get better than this 5/5

Of course, in China the competition from local rivals is even more fierce. Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi, Lenovo, Huawei’s Honor sub-brand and Meizu are just a few of the top manufacturers.

And many of the most ground-breaking smartphones are only launched in China, such as Honor’s Magic 2, which is all screen on the front with a back half that slides up to reveal a camera.

Xiaomi’s Mi Mix 3 does a similar thing with the back sliding up to reveal front-facing cameras, while the top of Oppo’s Find X pops up to reveal both front and rear cameras on command.

Where hardware innovation was dominated by the US and South Korea, China’s many smartphone firms are looking to lead the pack.

121,Business,Gadgets: the hardest thing to make now is a profit,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/01/gadgets-the-hardest-thing-to-make-now-is-a-profit,2019-01-01T15:57:45Z,"Imagine a shopper in an electronics store. Look, there’s a Fitbit display, with its “activity bands” which measure your steps and show details. Or, more pricey, its Versa smartwatch. Perhaps to save money, just buy the activity band? But wait … just over there are some generic activity bands, and they’re cheaper. Maybe save some money with those.

Move along a bit, and there are GoPro cameras. But once again, there are some slightly cheaper models beside them; not well-known brands, but a camera is a camera, surely? Further along, there’s a Parrot drone. Next to those is a Sonos speaker, which works with Amazon’s Alexa. But beside it is a cheaper Amazon Echo, and a voice-controlled Google Home, and a Siri-enabled Apple HomePod. Why would you go with the smaller brand, faced with those offerings from tech’s behemoths? Or, at the previous displays, why not just buy the cheaper models?

That’s the challenge for many consumer electronics firms. Not how to make things, or how to distribute them and get them in front of potential buyers. It’s how to make a profit. Out of Fitbit, GoPro, Parrot and Sonos – each operating in different parts of the consumer electronics business – only Sonos made an operating profit in the last financial quarter, and all four have made a cumulative operating loss so far this year.

Making a profit in hardware has always been difficult. By contrast, in software, all the significant costs are in development; reproduction and distribution are trivial – a digital copy is perfect, and the internet will transport 0s and 1s anywhere, effectively for free. If your product is free and ad-supported, you don’t even need anti-piracy measures; you want people to copy it and use it. Software companies typically have gross margins of around 80%, and operating profits of 40% or so.

In hardware, though, the world now seems full of companies living by the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s mantra that “your [profit] margin is my opportunity”. Indeed, Amazon is one of the reasons why long-term profit is more elusive: it provides a means for small startups to distribute products without formal warehousing arrangements, and compete with bigger businesses at lower cost.

That, together with the rise of a gigantic electronic manufacturing capability in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, about an hour’s drive north of Hong Kong, has made the modern hardware business one where only those with huge reserves of capital and brand recognition can hope to thrive. Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and Sony can probably rely on their brand name; after that, it’s survival of the fittest.

So is it already game over for GoPro and the rest? None is a newcomer. GoPro was founded in 2002 by Nick Woodman, who wanted to capture better pictures of a surfing trip to Australia; it came to market in June 2014. Sonos was also founded in 2002, focusing on multi-room high-quality sound, and came to the market earlier in 2018. Fitbit was set up in March 2007, and joined the stock market in June 2015. Parrot is the oldest of them all, founded in 1994 and has made many consumer electronics products, including a voice-recognition system (in 1995) and a Bluetooth-based hands-free kit for cars in 2000.

Parrot got into drones, both for consumers and business, in 2010 and early in 2018, its chief executive and co-founder, Henri Seydoux, confidently called the drone market “the emergence of a new industry with global strategic and economic stakes”. By November, though, he was contemplating a 40% year-on-year crash in revenues. The shares sank to an all-time low of €1.58 (£1.44) – down from €37 in 2015 – valuing Parrot at less than its cash reserves. Seydoux insists the consumer drone market is just “taking a break”.

Fitbit is struggling to move away from fitness bands – simple devices that record steps and calories burnt – where low-cost Chinese products are swamping the market. It is trying to shift into smartwatches, which are higher-priced, have more uses and generate higher customer loyalty. But it’s not easy; in the first nine months of the year it sold 8.4m fitness bands – and 2.8m smartwatches. The opportunity is there: Fitbit has 25m users who pay a subscription to its services, and could be future smartwatch buyers. But in the most recent quarter it made a $200m (£157m) operating loss on sales of $940m and over the past eight quarters it has made a net loss of $624m. Its shares, which hit $47 soon after its IPO in 2015, are now $4.97.

GoPro has managed to stabilise its unit sales, at about 1m per quarter, but profitability has remained elusive. So it is trying to encourage owners on to a subscription offering, at $5 per month; so far 185,000 have signed up, generating about $11.1m a year. That’s about the same revenue as selling an extra 44,000 cameras – but the profit on subscriptions, as with software, is far higher than on the hardware. Its shares are currently at $4.24, down from $87 in 2014.

“It’s harder for any company that focuses mainly on hardware to survive in the long term,” says Francisco Jeronimo, a smartphone analyst for the research group IDC. “But the big problem for many of these companies is that there isn’t a strong incentive to keep buying them. I might buy a GoPro, but I don’t need it on a daily basis if I have a smartphone. Same with Parrot – it’s a very niche segment. These companies were so eager to get to an IPO that they took advantage of the hype around their category, but haven’t been able to reinvent themselves, and they need to do that to keep alive.”

The risk for such companies is that they are consigned to the virtual, or real, cupboard under the stairs to gather dust, while smartphone capability expands to take on functions that once needed a separate device.

Yet it’s never been easier to make and sell hardware. Crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo provide easy ways to find early adopters who will stake money on entrepreneurs with unproven designs, which can then be realised in Shenzhen. The Pebble smartwatch raised $10.3m as a Kickstarter project in 2012, then its biggest-ever fundraising; it topped that in 2015, raising $20.3m for a newer model. Yet in December 2016 it announced it would close, citing financial trouble. (Fitbit bought its intellectual property – essentially, the smartwatch software – for $23m.) “Crowdfunding sites are great for attracting early adopters, but the majority of consumers don’t go there,” says Jeronimo. “It misleads companies into thinking their category is going to explode.”

Even while it tried to expand beyond those early adopters, Pebble’s problem (which is now also Fitbit’s problem) was that Apple launched its own smartwatch in 2015, and quickly became the largest smartwatch maker. Sonos, similarly, found that a market it once had to itself – multi-room speakers streaming music and radio from the internet – turned into a jostling match with Amazon in 2014, followed by Google and most recently, Apple. Suddenly, everyone is making a “smart speaker”, and Sonos’s hardware-only model has come into sharp focus because it doesn’t have a native voice assistant (it is adding Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s ‘OK Google’).

The ability for the big players to squash smaller players isn’t unique to hardware; Facebook has tried to do it to rivals such as Snapchat. But in hardware, firms such as Sonos find themselves assaulted by both the big brands and the unheard-of ones leveraging Shenzhen and Amazon’s distribution.

Sonos’s response has been to insist that people will move upmarket, to its better sound quality. It is also looking for collaborations, most notably with Ikea, whose fruits are promised in 2019. Patrick Spence, the Sonos CEO, is confident he can rely on the existing Sonos user base of 20m devices across 7.4m households.

“We have a strong base of existing customers that we can tap into and have a good relationship with,” he said in November. “And so, I think that puts us at an advantage, [compared with rivals] quite frankly.” But Amazon is coming up fast: it is reckoned to have 35m of its Echo devices installed in the US alone.

The squeeze on smaller hardware players has played out before, in PCs and smartphones. In the mid-1990s, the PC market was dominated by American companies such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Gateway, Apple, Compaq, NCR, Packard Bell and Zenith. As manufacturing costs in the US rose, they shifted production to Taiwan, South Korea and, gradually, China – only to be usurped by local rivals using that manufacturing expertise and building international distribution networks. Now, only Dell, HP and Apple remain; the three other biggest PC makers are Acer and Asus, of Taiwan, and China’s Lenovo.

Similarly in smartphones, the early advantage that American companies such as BlackBerry and Motorola had in 2009 was quickly eroded as the market expanded. Now there are hundreds of Chinese companies offering smartphones. But profits are thin: Counterpoint Research estimated recently that the top five smartphone companies grab 99% of the profits – leaving 600 others to scrap for the remaining 1%.",0.999,
122,News,Hello 2019 – what are you likely to bring?,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/01/what-will-happen-in-2019-main-events,2019-01-01T02:00:06Z,"A year is much more than just 365 days, or one orbit of the Earth around the sun. One year produces so many events and human stories that in 2018 alone, the Guardian published more than 73,000 news articles.

Much of what happens is unpredictable. But with 2019 only hours old, there are a few things that can confidently be foretold.

Brexit may be clear as mud, but if it’s making you queasy then here are a few fixed political points in the year to steady the balance.

It’s a busy year for elections, with four of the world’s most populous democracies holding votes.

Europe holds parliamentary elections from 23-26 May to elect 705 new MEPs. Watch closely to see how well the populist far-right does. It’s been gaining ground across the continent, but will the attentions of Steve Bannon, formerly of Breitbart and the Trump White house, help or hinder?

Before that, Nigerians head to the polls in February. Sitting president Muhammadu Buhari faces a record 78 opposition candidates, some of whom accuse him of failing to deal adequately with corruption.

Following an illness earlier this year and five months spent recuperating in London, there have also been bizarre suggestions that he has been replaced by a body double. That would certainly make campaigning in the world’s seventh most populous country easier.

Other major democracies going to the polls include India, where Narendra Modi is seeking a second term, and Indonesia, where the one-term incumbent faces a challenge from yet another rightwing populist candidate.

Speaking of rightwing populists, Brazil’s newly elected and controversial president Jair Bolsonaro takes office on 1 January. Other notable votes take place in Thailand (February), South Africa (May), Argentina (October) and Canada (October).

And finally, in Japan, Emperor Akihito will abdicate in April owing to health concerns after heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer. This will be the first time a Japanese emperor has abdicated in two centuries.

What summits are there to climb?

The last time France hosted the G7 summit of the world’s most industrialised nations in 2011, migration was a fringe issue, Emmanuel Macron was a little-known investment banker and the riots were happening across the channel in the UK.

This time around, President Macron will welcome his peers to Biarritz in August. Priorities are likely to include climate change, the Global Partnership for Education, towards which Macron pledged €500m (£452m) of funding, and migration.

The G7’s larger cousin, the G20, will meet in Japan in June. Founded after the financial crash of 2008, the summit promotes cooperation and a focus on global financial markets. The G20 has been criticised for becoming “a stage for an increasing number of authoritarian and populist leaders who are there to perform for their restive followers back home”. According to the Guardian’s economics editor Phillip Inman, this year’s version will be “increasingly hampered by Donald Trump’s protectionist policies”.

Another year means another COP – the abbreviation for the annual UN climate summits that warn, with increasing severity, how imperilled we are by our carbon addiction. Alas, this year’s host, Brazil, has pulled out owing to “budget restrictions”. If the summit goes ahead, discussion will surely centre on Trump’s continued disavowal of the Paris agreement, and a review of the 2030 UN Sustainable Development goals, four years on from their implementation.

The Women Deliver conference, which is held once every two years on women’s equality and gender rights, will take place in June in Canada, with Justin Trudeau billed to speak – the first time a sitting leader of a country has done so.

What anniversaries and milestones are coming up?

As 2018 marked the 100th anniversary of the first world war armistice, so 2019 will see the 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Versailles, the formal end of the conflict. It is also the 70th anniversary of the founding of Nato, the collective defence pact originally set up to “keep the Russians out, the Americans in and the Germans down”.

The internet is poised to pass a notable milestone meanwhile, with predictions that the number of global users will pass the 50% mark in 2019. In the US, for the first time ever the population will have more people older than age 60 than younger than age 18.

In births and deaths, 2019 is the 500th anniversary of the death of original renaissance man Leonardo Da Vinci and the 200th anniversary of the birth of Queen Victoria. It also marks the 250th anniversary of Captain Cook reaching New Zealand, and the 20th anniversary of the creation of the euro.

This year will mark the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s moon landing. No human has been back since 1972. Perhaps a moment to rekindle interest in our cosmological outrider.

The year will also see the first private spacecraft from SpaceX and Boeing take crews to the International Space Station. There will also be the first images of a black hole from the Event Horizon telescope, and the first results from the ESA’s Trace Gas Orbiter probe, which is circling Mars to work out if methane plumes are due to life on the planet.

Back on Earth, the landmark agreement to redefine the kilogram will come into place in May. Rather than being tied to a lump of metal stored in a Parisian vault, the new definition will be a reflection of Planck’s constant, a number rooted in the quantum world. The weight is over.

2019 could see the first birth in the UK of a baby with DNA from three parents. The process of mitochondrial transfer was legalised in Britain in 2015 and Professor Alison Murdoch has since been pioneering the technique in Newcastle, with the first woman selected to take part in the process this year.

John Vary, a futurologist at John Lewis’s Innovation Labs, notes some broader, science fiction-style developments which may also intrigue us in 2019.

“In 2019, we could reach a point where customers can share their DNA with shops so that retailers can tailor products to a customer’s genetics or ancestry,” he predicts. “Waitrose & Partners is piloting DnaNudge, an app which will use shoppers’ DNA to help them make healthier choices while food shopping. Another example is OME Health, which offers health plans built on a person’s gut microbiome, genetics blood markers and other health data.”

Will there be a global recession?

Despite 2019 being the Chinese year of the pig – a symbol that denotes wealth – in the western world there may be an economic downturn ahead. According to economics editor Phillip Inman: “A recession looms in the UK, Europe and the US. It is possible once the impact of slowing growth in China and rising interest rates are put together, since most of the momentum after the financial crash of 2008 was based on cheap borrowing and the rapid expansion of Chinese trade. Without these two essential elements, the major economies are heading for trouble. Most doomsayer analysts consider 2020 a more likely year for a slump, with the seeds sown in 2019 by poor policy making.”

The World Bank is predicting a global slowdown in 2019, as the stimulative impact of Donald Trump’s tax cuts wane in the US and China is forced to restrict borrowing by state and private businesses.

Central banks are also poised to tighten monetary policies. “The US Federal Reserve is due to increase interest rates at least twice in 2019,” Inman says. “It is also expected to further unwind its quantitative easing policy. An increase in the cost of borrowing is already hitting the US housing market which is reaching levels of distress last seen in the run up to the 2008 financial crash.”

The World Trade Organisation could be unableto judge trade disputes between countries in 2019. When he took office, Donald Trump blocked the appointment of judges to the WTO to replace retirees, leaving a large number of vacancies. The WTO needs a minimum number of legal experts to judge cases and could be inquorate as early as spring 2019.

What should I buy in 2019?

There will be no shortage of new technological releases in 2019. Samsung is due to launch follow-ups to its critically acclaimed Galaxy S and Note series, while Apple will be announcing a new iPhone in September, and Google the Pixel 4 phone in October.

Amazon will be announcing new products in September, likely to be iterations of its home management Echo devices, and Apple will unveil new Macs and tablets in October. In terms of tech developments, the Guardian’s assistant technology editor Samuel Gibbs predicts that the biggest advance will come in the form of flexible screens in 2019.

Futurologist John Vary adds that the voice search enabled by products such as Google Home and Amazon’s Alexa will develop to “enable people to find items however they describe them and in any language”. While augmented reality could enhance personalised shopping to mean “smart home tech could act as your own shopper, alerting retailers in advance when you’re looking for a product,” he says.

With Channel 4 moving to new headquarters in Leeds in 2019, the Guardian’s TV editor, Lanre Bakare, picks the fourth season of comedy Catastrophe and Brexit: The Uncivil War, as ones to watch on the channel next year. Catastrophe tells the story of a couple raising a child conceived in a one night stand. The two-hour Brexit drama meanwhile stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Leave campaigner Dominic Cummings, and is based on first-hand accounts of the campaigns leading up to Britain’s referendum on leaving the EU in 2016.

Further recommendations include big-budget sequels – the final season of fantasy thriller Game of Thrones, airing on Sky Atlantic in April. There’s also the third season of the brooding American noir True Detective in January. Moonlight Oscar winner Mahershala Ali takes the lead from season two’s Colin Farrell and Rachel McAdams. Finally, everyone’s favourite local Norwich radio presenter returns to the BBC with a satirical take on a live talk show in February on This Time … With Alan Partridge.

On the big screen there is a volley of new releases to look out for. With 2018 being a record-breaking year for box office takings, major studios will be hoping to replicate their success with a slate of blockbusters: a live-action Lion King in July, Captain Marvel in May – the franchise’s first female-led film – Toy Story 4 in June, Terminator 6 and Frozen 2 in November, and the final instalment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, Star Wars IX, in December.

The Guardian’s film editor Catherine Shoard’s picks include King’s Speech director Tom Hooper’s adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Cats, starring Idris Elba, Taylor Swift, Judi Dench and Ian McKellen. There is also the Downton Abbey movie; Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman, starring Godfathers Al Pacino and Robert De Niro; Get Out director Jordan Peele’s latest horror, Us; an adaptation of Donna Tartt’s novel The Goldfinch starring Nicole Kidman; and Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of Little Women, starring 2018’s newcomer Timothée Chalamet.

Valued at more than $93bn, the games industry almost doubles the revenue of the international film industry, and the Guardian’s games editor Keza MacDonald has some selections for 2019. Keza picks out Harry Potter Go, made by the creators of Pokémon Go, as “another potential world-conquering mobile game”, she says, this time based on the Harry Potter universe. There is also Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice – a horror samurai game from the director of Dark Souls, “one of the best games of the decade”, according to MacDonald; and The Last of Us Part 2, an “intense, cinematic game about a survivor of a world-decimating outbreak – far from the usual boring zombie story”.

Adele by Leila Slimani (February)

One of the runaway bestsellers of 2016 was Slimani’s Lullaby, a chilling tale of a homicidal immigrant nanny, and Slimani hopes to continue this success with a new novel telling the story of a sex-addicted Parisian journalist.

Black Leopard, Red Wolf by Marlon James (February)

Marlon James releases the follow-up to his Man Booker Prize-winning 2015 novel, A Brief History of Seven Killings.

123,Opinion,"With China, we don’t need a trade war but a truce on tech | Anne McElvoy",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/28/huawei-west-trade-war-tech-china-shenzhen,2018-12-28T15:08:10Z,"A visit to Huawei’s HQ in Shenzhen is a glimpse into the way China’s leadership would like to envision its future. About 180,000 workers throng quietly around a pristine campus in the new-build city, which prizes digital expertise so highly that some outstanding engineers are lured with special rent deals to work on a campus that looks more like architect-designed Silicon Valley than the crowded factories that feature in much of urban China.

I was whisked around examples of sleek bicycles, remote-controlled fridges telling me when food needed to be consumed and super-fast immersive gaming – all showcasing the speed and flexibility of 5G-honed technology. Huawei is the jewel in China’s tech crown, a subject of pride at home and an export success as the world’s biggest supplier of telecoms equipment. But that jewel is fast turning into a flashpoint between Beijing and western governments, emblematic of deeper tensions about trade, security and a divide over the hidden risks of globalised digital advances.

The UK’s defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, has voiced “grave “and “very deep concerns” at the prospect of Huawei providing technology to upgrade Britain’s lagging mobile phone network – after the head of MI5 called coyly for a “conversation” about the risks of embedding Chinese technology in national infrastructure. The US, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Germany are raising more vocal concerns about prospective leakage from Huawei and other tech companies to the Chinese intelligence services.

Yet in many ways Huawei exemplifies the successes of globalisation. It is a successful global exporter (often backed by huge Chinese bank loans to spread its telecoms products into Africa). You can see a splurge of adverts for its phones in teenage-friendly pastel hues, and it provides a good-value alternative to the dominance of Apple and Samsung in western markets. Huawei worries the west in part because China’s push into 5G and artificial intelligence (AI) threatens to fulfil the Khrushchev-era promise of “catching up with and overtaking” its technological advances.

The arrest in Canada this month of the company’s chief financial officer (and daughter of its founder), Meng Wanzhou, on suspicion of overseeing deals that broke US sanctions against Iran, raised the stakes. Huawei protests innocence, and says its products would never allow a “back door” for the Chinese government to access sensitive data. But given the close eye the Chinese state keeps on major tech companies and laws that put intelligence requirements ahead of the autonomy of businesses, precautionary measures look like a good idea. The question facing the British and other governments, however, is what these should look like without adding to counterproductive trade wars.

Our experience in western democracies teaches us to beware both governments and companies gathering data without restraint. We have seen the temptations to abuse that follow. That goes with extra vigour for countries where open debate on such matters is fiercely constrained. One of my interviews with a China tech titan concluded in (his) bad temper about the audacity of asking about the risks to personal liberties from AI. Another, until recently more open, begged for such matters to be discussed off the record.

Yet our own messages are mixed and mangled – and they are not getting any clearer. Britain’s politburo has been split for years on the issue. Theresa May as home secretary dug in against Chinese investment in the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant. Williamson is an ally of the prime minister – he orchestrated her leadership bid and is keen to play a similar role in anointing her successor. So it will be intriguing to see whether his warning is followed up by Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, who has cultivated a pro-China stance as the leading advocate of a free-trade no-deal Brexit.

Choices, so far fudged or muddled through, are unavoidable. We host lavish state visits to drum up trade with royal bells and whistles, and pints of bitter consumed with President Xi in a country pub. May headed her own delegation of business folk to the country, rivalling Chancellor Merkel’s habit of bussing Germany industrialists to China to signal state support for lucrative deals. Post-Brexit visions for offsetting the damage of leaving the European single market tout business with Asia as the solution (in the absence of any major trade deal with the US) – and that means foregrounding China.

Alas, there is only so much cake and tea we can sell to each other, so technology has to be part of new trade deals, in the way that steel and machinery was in the past. More household items will be 5G-enabled in the next few years and it will be essential to the development of driverless cars. So even if 5G is kept out of the main telecoms systems, that may prove more symbolic than decisive, as it makes its way into our lives through sundry products and the lure of cheap, available innovations.

Huawei, after a bit of ritual Chinese huff, seems to have got the message: the company is reported to have offered up to £1.5bn worth of “technical changes” to satisfy British concerns, a sign that it is serious enough about western markets to offer compromises. Beyond this standoff, Beijing needs to decide whether the short-term gains of cyber-hacking – in terms of both data and prestige – are worth the damage being done to the companies that are the badge of China’s innovation and diligence.

The west will need to balance fretfulness about security with a confidence that global trade remains the building block of our prosperity and peaceful relations – especially with awkward large powers. It’s not a new trade war we need with the People’s Republic in the year ahead, but a technological truce.

124,Technology,Folding screens and 5G: what's coming in smartphones in 2019?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/28/folding-screens-5g-smartphones-2019,2018-12-28T08:00:18Z,"From the launch of 5G to phones with large folding screens, more cameras and fingerprint scanners under the screens, 2019 looks set to transform the smartphone in more ways than one.

2018 produced phones with notches hiding selfie cameras and sensors in the top of the screen. While not quite the innovation most were likely seeking, notches allowed manufacturers to remove everything from the front that wasn’t screen.

Now that the smartphone is essentially all screen on the front and a slab of glass on the back, what’s next for phone innovation?

Notches are an ugly necessity at the moment – everyone but Apple agrees – as the camera has to go somewhere. But they don’t have to be large intrusive bars.

2019 will see new hole-punch screens, which literally have small holes in the display through which the selfie camera pokes. Huawei has already announced two phones with a diminutive hole in the display, as has Samsung with its Galaxy A8s.

With more devices expected to follow, it appears 2019 will be the year of the punch-hole display.

What was long seen as the holy grail of biometric systems, the fingerprint scanner embedded into the screen finally became a reality in the mass market at the end of 2018 with the OnePlus 6T and Huawei Mate 20 Pro.

Strictly speaking, the scanners are under the display, reading the ridges on your thumb or finger through the pixels of your screen. The current generation optical sensors are to be joined by improved ultrasonic sensors next year in a variety of phones.

When all you have is a screen on the front and camera on the back, there’s not much to differentiate one model from the next in terms of design.

“The rectangular touchscreen has become the dominant design for smartphones and there is little sign of that changing anytime soon,” says Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight.

If you were hoping for a radical new design in 2019, you might be out of luck.

Having killed off the compact camera, smartphones are coming for the big, expensive digital SLRs and their ilk.

First we had dual cameras on the back, then triple and now even quadruple. Some have up to 10x zoom that doesn’t look like a distorted mess, while most sport ever improving portrait modes for that pleasing shallow depth of field bokeh effect.

“Cameras are a major battleground when it comes to competitive differentiation,” says Wood.

Expect to see even greater use of computational photography, where multiple images from single or multiple cameras are combined to create a photo with algorithms, improving your candid snaps, particularly in low light.

5G will finally launch in 2019 with faster data and ever more expensive phones. But it won’t just be 5G phones pushing up the price. The cost of phones in the top-end market dominated by Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy S series is expected to continue to rise.

“Don’t be surprised to see the £2,000 phone in 2019 – the advent of 5G, premium materials, perhaps foldable devices and more will see the emergence of a new ultra-premium segment,” says Wood. “Apple has let the way on smartphone inflation and we expect manufacturers to keep pushing the boundaries – particularly as people hold on to their phones for longer.”

If you can’t stomach paying £1,000 for a phone, there is hope. With a new super-premium category, the market for slightly more competitive devices that offer top-performance is likely to expand.

OnePlus has proved the niche exists with top-end phones costing under £500 in UK. Now it has been joined by Chinese rival Xiaomi and it aggressively priced top end phones, alongside the increasing sales of Honor, Huawei’s cheaper sub-brand.

Old phones in hands for longer

Giant leaps in performance and capability are long gone, chilling the desire to upgrade and leading to an ever increasing segment of the population holding onto their phones for longer.

“A recent survey by CCS Insight among a statistically representative sample of UK consumers indicated that 36% of people will hold onto their smartphone longer than the previous device they had,” said Wood.

Like the chicken and the egg, it’s likely the more expensive a phone is the longer someone might hold onto it, which may in turn force prices up as manufacturers struggle to maintain profits. At least those without a cut of services such as Google Pay or the Apple App Store.

But what about folding phones?

Like something out of science fiction, folding phones will become a reality next year, with one already unveiled and Samsung’s effort due to be launched at some point in 2019.

Whether or not the reality lives up to the fantasy, folding phones are likely to remain niche for years.

“Although a magnet for gadget lovers, the folding phone’s inevitable high cost and its trade-offs in usability will result in limited shipments. Problems are likely to include poor readability in sunlight, a bulky design to protect the screen’s fold and the need for an external screen,” says Wood in his predictions for CCS Insight.

Still, if you really must have the most bleeding-edge device, it looks like you will be able to buy one in some form as the never-ending quest for larger and larger displays continues.

125,Technology,"Why Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s ‘adult in the room’, may pay the price for its failings",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/22/facebook-sheryl-sandbrook-faces-axe,2018-12-22T16:00:01Z,"Facebook’s already terrible year is ending on a new low, as Mark Zuckerberg and his beleaguered executive team battle another share price slide, this time triggered by new revelations about the company’s relaxed attitude to the privacy of its 2.2 billion customers’ data.

Shares dropped more than 7% on Tuesday after it was revealed that the company had bent its own data rules for clients including Netflix, Spotify, Amazon, Microsoft and Sony.

The latest damaging report, published by the New York Times on the back of a District of Columbia lawsuit accusing the social media giant of exposing residents to political manipulation by “failing to protect” user data during the 2016 US presidential election, will surely be disagreeable to Zuckerberg, Facebook’s 34-year-old founder, chief executive and controlling stockholder.

But it is Sheryl Sandberg, former chief of staff at the US treasury under Larry Summers and the woman brought in a decade ago to be the “adult” in Facebook’s executive ranks, who is largely taking the heat for the company’s mounting operational, financial, political and public relations challenges.

Clearly, Sandberg has much to account for as chief operating officer. Facebook’s travails, which have seen it shares drop nearly 40% since their July peak, are not Sandberg’s alone to carry, though on some days it appears the 49-year-old has been doing much of the heavy lifting.

“There’s little doubt the company is facing critical challenges and has made some egregious mistakes,” says Kathryn Kolbert of the Athena Centre for Leadership Studies. “The fact that Sandberg was brought in to be the adult in the room does not absolve Zuckerberg of responsibility.

“Mark Zuckerberg is the CEO of a multibillion-dollar company, and he’s been at it a while. He’s a grown-up. He ought to be responsible. But from what I see, there isn’t the sense that both should be accountable.”

Five weeks ago, Sandberg’s key role in shaping the company’s response to multiple crises was exposed, again by the New York Times. These have included the revelations of Russian interference in the 2016 election, the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and the decision to hire a rightwing opposition research company, Definers Public Affairs, to apply aggressive political campaign tactics to Facebook’s PR and to look into the finances of high-profile investor George Soros days after he publicly criticised the big US technology companies.

Facebook claimed that the research into Soros “was already under way when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr Soros had shorted Facebook’s stock”.

However, the backlash against Sandberg, until recently a figurehead for tech-branded progressive feminism, has barely relented.

The bestselling author, who just a year ago was riding high on the success of Option B, a follow-up to her empowerment manual Lean In, is taking hits from all sides.

Sandberg, as the executive who helped develop Google’s ad-supported business strategy before joining Facebook, was in the firing line in September when the company became the focus of an American Civil Liberties Union complaint alleging that its advertising system allows employers to target job ads based on gender.

Three weeks ago, before a sold-out audience at the Barclays Centre indoor arena in Brooklyn, former first lady Michelle Obama said Sandberg’s belief that women can always “have it all” if they assert themselves across their personal and professional lives – a key tenet of Sandberg’s Lean In philosophy– is “a lie”.

“It’s not always enough to lean in because that shit doesn’t work all the time,” Obama reportedly said.

Then last week the civil rights group NAACP launched a week-long boycott of Facebook after a report it had commissioned highlighted concerns over voter suppression, ad targeting and the company’s own issue with workplace diversity.

“We know that we need to do more: to listen, look deeper and take action to respect fundamental rights,” Sandberg said in a conciliatory statement.

According to Nathalie Molina Niño, author of Leapfrog: The New Revolution for Women Entrepreneurs, part of the hostility aimed at Sandberg is certainly related to her gender. “The higher a woman gets in terms of success, the greater the culture that enjoys taking her down,” Niño says. Indeed, negative posts on Sandberg’s own Facebook page are largely written by men.

At the same time, Niño points out, Lean In missed the mark because it failed to reflect the experience of most women who are balancing work and family.

As a result, Sandberg has become synonymous with a particular brand of female empowerment that is considered out of touch with notions of inclusiveness.

“It’s applicable only to women in the corporate world and that’s a fairly small, marginal group,” Niño says. What Lean In showed, in fact, “is in contrast to what is true for most women, and the backlash against Sandberg is a reflection of that reality”.

But Sandberg is not standing back. It is a measure of her resilience, as well as solid support from Zuckerberg and Facebook’s board, that she has stayed put.

In an interview with the news network CNN, Zuckerberg said: “Sheryl is a really important part of this company and is leading a lot of the efforts to address a lot of the biggest issues that we have. She’s been an important partner for me for 10 years ... I hope that we work together for decades more to come.”

While Sandberg is taking the heat for Facebook’s problems, Zuckerberg appears to be relatively unscathed. “The company is facing incredible challenges and has made egregious mistakes, so Zuckerberg should bear primary responsibility,” says Charles Elson, expert in corporate governance at the University of Delaware.

Forcing Sandberg out, he says, would solve the perception that the company is taking action, but achieve nothing in terms of resolving the seemingly insurmountable issue of policing the user content of a global social network.

“The public wants somebody to take the fall, and since Zuckerberg is the owner he’s not going to do it. So they’ve come to the view that Sandberg is the next best thing.”

But that risks a potential new PR backlash by pushing Sandberg out without solving any of the company’s data privacy and political manipulation issues.

If Sandberg departs, her brand too tarnished to be of further use to Facebook, the decision will be Zuckerberg’s to make. “As the majority voting shareholder, he calls the shots,” Elson points out.

126,Media,Channel 4 faces £200m-plus ad blackout over TV audience dispute,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/20/channel-4-faces-200m-plus-ad-blackout-over-tv-audience-dispute,2018-12-20T16:52:09Z,"Channel 4 is facing a costly TV advertising blackout from some major corporate names in a dispute over the cost of buying commercial space on its portfolio of channels.

The row will result in the withdrawal of big-name advertisers including Ariel and Pampers-maker Procter & Gamble, GlaxoSmithKline, Samsung, Reckitt Benckiser and Asda from 1 January if a deal is not reached in time.

The advertisers are clients of the UK media-buying arm of Publicis Groupe, the world’s third-largest marketing services company, which spends about £210m a year on Channel 4 in deals struck on behalf of its clients.

Talks between Channel 4 and Publicis Media over a new advertising deal for next year have broken down over the issue of TV ad price rises despite a decline in the broadcaster’s audiences. Any delay in striking a deal will cost Channel 4 millions of pounds every week in lost revenue. Channel 4 also sells ad space for BT Sport and UKTV’s portfolio of 10 channels, which means the broadcaster will effectively have to compensate its partners for their loss of revenue too.

Jonathan Allan, chief commercial officer at Channel 4, has taken the highly unusual step of writing directly to Publicis Media clients as it faces a significant hole in the ad revenues the commercially funded broadcaster relies upon. Publicis Groupe accounts for about 17% of Channel 4’s total sales revenue.

“As I write, it looks very much like we may not reach an agency agreement with Publicis Media,” said Allan in the letter. “This means we will not be able to offer you the opportunity to advertise across our portfolio of 26 linear channels and three video-on-demand platforms from the start of next year.”

While an eleventh hour deal could still be reached both sides are understood to be dug into their negotiating positions and unwilling to give ground.

Channel 4 rivals including ITV, Channel 5 and Sky would be set to benefit from extra client spending being diverted to them because of the standoff.

The dispute is the worst commercial crisis for Channel 4 since Group M, the media buying arm of WPP, pulled clients’ budgets worth £250m annually from the broadcaster for two weeks at the start of 2013.",-0.8476,
127,Technology,iPhone owners have less than two weeks to replace battery for £25,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/20/iphone-owners-have-less-than-two-weeks-to-replace-battery-for-25,2018-12-20T11:30:58Z,"Owners of iPhones with failing batteries have 12 days to take advantage of Apple’s out-of-warranty £25 battery swap offer before the price rises to as much as £65.

The discounted battery replacement scheme, which applies to the iPhone 6 and newer models, was launched following revelations last year that Apple was intentionally slowing iPhones because of worn batteries.

Apple apologised and reduced the cost of its out-of-warranty battery replacements for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, 6S and 6S Plus, SE, 7 and 7 Plus, 8 and 8 Plus and iPhone X.

It also rolled out an iOS software update that showed the health of the phone’s battery and allowed users to switch off the feature that slowed their performance to avoid power problems.

If the iPhone reports that the battery is worn out or a user experiences slower performance because of an old battery, they can get it replaced in-store for £25 or via post for an additional £7.44 shipping fee.

But from 1 January, the cost of a battery replacement will increase to £45 for phones from the iPhone 6 or newer, or £65 for the iPhone X. The cost for older iPhones such as the 5S will be £79.

Battery replacements within the warranty period, or if the user has Apple’s extended warranty, AppleCare+, are free.

Apple said in December last year that it intentionally slowed iPhones via software updates to prolong their useful life and avoid power problems caused by degraded batteries in older devices.

But it did so without informing users, leading many to accuse the company of resorting to planned obsolescence, something Apple strongly denies.

Apple was questioned by the US Senate over its actions, faced inquiries in various countries, and was forced to make multiple apologies.

Glee. A simple but palpable joy on waking. I bounded out of bed, looking forward to the day. Then a sudden jolt had me standing, motionless, gazing across the room in wonder. I’m looking forward to my day! I’m looking forward to my day? Bloody hell! A slow grin squeezed my cheeks as energy zipped around my body and, refusing to be contained, had me gyrating my hips and arms in sync, dancing, naked, around my bedroom, wondering whether I’d care – or stop – if either of my teenage children walked in. I’m looking forward to my day! I’m looking forward to my day! Whaaaaa-hoo!

It was, in fact, an ordinary day. I was getting the train to work, sitting in an office, then coming home again. But my energy! I could feel it pulsing through me and my body tingled with vitality. Later, at my desk, my concentration was focused, the words I was reading hanging together. Walking around the building, my torso stood tall. In conversations, my brain and mouth played ball. None of which had been the case all on the same day for a long, long time.

The best part of this energised, vivacious me, however, was the absence of any niggling doubt. No background anxiety that I’d never feel like this again: that this was a one-off; that this was how everybody, except me, got to feel most of the time; that this being part of the human race again would be zapped away tomorrow.

No, this joyous life force, this jubilant exuberance for merely existing, was a part of me, propelling me into each moment. And, fabulously, amazingly, miraculously, I knew how to get it. After 20 years of not knowing and desperately trying, hoping, longing, and oh, so-wretchedly failing, I now knew how to sleep.

Sleep. The elixir of life. Something most people take for granted. Like oxygen. Or a skeleton. Or the sunrise. “I’m tired,” people say. And I resist the temptation to give them my life story. Or, at least, my night-time story of the past two decades.

It began when I was expecting my first child. “Pregnancy insomnia,” Google told me, “is common in the third trimester.” The discomfort of a distended stomach, added pressure on the bladder and heartburn were the reasonable-sounding causes – and I certainly experienced all those symptoms in the day. But at night, I would easily drop off to sleep only to wake, suddenly and completely, assuming it was morning. But it wasn’t. It was 4am. Or thereabouts. I was not uncomfortable and didn’t need to pee. I was, simply, maddeningly, wide awake and hyper alert.

The first few times, I heaved my body on to its side next to my peacefully sleeping husband and told myself that at least I was resting. Little nagging thoughts passed the time. Should I really have bought that tiny orange baby dress? Is the receipt in my purse? Heeding online advice, I bought a special pillow to wedge under my belly, reduced fluid intake in the evening and chewed dried papaya. Still I woke.

Ping! 4am. Sometimes it was 3am. Or 2am. I stared at the red neon numbers, blood crawling beneath my skin. Slumping back down, my wide open eyes fell on faint shadows on the blank ceiling. Why? Why can’t I sleep?

It was a pattern that continued after my daughter was born – and four years later my son – only now, getting up through the night to feed or soothe my young children was part of the sleeplessness cocktail. Sometimes I shouted “go away” at my young daughter, as the door clicked open, waking me from precious sleep. Then I’d lie in the dark, my back, neck and head wracked with tension, tortuous thoughts circling. “What’s happening to me? Why do I find life so difficult? My poor kids. I wish they had a better mother. I hate my life. I need to get away. Maybe I’ve gone mad?” There was no going back to sleep for several hours or, more often, the rest of the night.

The days passed in a treacle of fatigue, the armchair in the corner of the kitchen beckoning. In spare moments, I’d sink into it, relief washing over my tightened limbs. Some days I’d retreat to bed with a self-help or parenting book as soon as my husband got home around 6pm, understanding words and my duvet providing comfort and hope. Other days I’d long for the children’s bedtime so mine could follow. Turning the light off anything later than 10pm made me nervous. 8.30pm was not unusual. My social life narrowed to the few friends who consented to the increasingly specific parameters I had for going out: not too late, not too far, not too long, not the night before I had something important happening, not the night of something important happening. Getting to bed early and conserving my energy were my overarching priorities. Meanwhile, my husband, stretched in his job as an assistant head in a secondary comprehensive school, was becoming increasingly distant, another source of anxiety for my bewildered mind. Indecision had become as normal as fatigue and it was only once my son started school that I managed to summon the wherewithal to search in earnest for an explanation and treatment.

I found no shortage of either: it was my circadian rhythms, my digestive tract, lung activity, hormones, vitamin deficiency, ancestral shadows, the direction my bed faced, karmic activity, the colour of my curtains. I explored it all, taking whatever alternative remedies I could get my hands on, from common or garden Nytol to ordering melatonin from the US. I saw a sleep therapist, and a homoeopath, had acupuncture, cranial osteopathy, learned to meditate, studied Buddhism, tried hypnosis, rubbed balm into my temples, drank camomile tea, had lavender baths, tapped parts of my body, listened to whales, burned candles, opened the window, shut the window, changed my duvet, and my pillow, put a healing stone next to my bed, barely consumed alcohol, never caffeine, stopped my water intake at 6pm, ate lettuce…

The burst of optimism that accompanied each new fix may or may not have been responsible for the minuscule and short-term relief each one brought. Hurray, I’d slept until 4.30am. Or even 4.40am. Very occasionally 5.30am. But after two or three nights of progress, a 2am waking followed, as night follows day. I dreaded going to bed, would see each foot place itself ahead of me as I ascended the stairs, a slight churn in my stomach.

The history and brutal treatment of anxiety and mental health issues on the female side of my lineage hung over me, informing two key decisions: I never used the word insomniac about myself and I was not going to take drugs. My grandmother had been diagnosed with postnatal depression in the 1940s and given electric shock treatment, which she hated and was terrified of. Her doctor told her she was “unfit to be a mother” and two of her children were sent to an orphanage. A generation later, my mother was diagnosed with manic depression and given lithium – the poison in batteries – and told she’d have to be on it for the rest of her life. Thirty years later, digestive problems led to a chain of operations in her stomach, kidneys and bowel. Then there was the doctor who, back when I was born, told her with, as I have always imagined, a wagging finger and stern expression: “You must get your sleep.” I was brought home from hospital and put in a room furthest from hers so my cries didn’t wake her. And most mornings, as I was growing up, she would ask, in a slightly urgent tone: “How did you sleep?” We tiptoed around the house in the afternoons so as not to disturb her nap. Pills rattled on the kitchen table at breakfast.

A generation later, the world of self-help offered an alternative to the “mad woman who needs to be subdued with drugs” narrative that has wreaked havoc with so many women’s lives. Immersing myself in books and courses, the next 10 years took me on a long, deep journey of self-discovery. My past unravelled and so, to my immense regret, did my marriage. I learned how to handle my state, no matter how tired, desperate, furious, or despondent I felt. When I woke in the night, I now knew how to tune into my anxiety and to distinguish between the fears in my head and the feelings in my body. I had learned how to calm myself, but not how to sleep. My discoveries did help me hold down my part-time job on a national newspaper, though I sat, as hidden as possible, in a corner of the office, lest someone spot my head jerking suddenly, as it did on the handful of occasions I nodded off at my desk. And I raised two beautiful, caring, gifted and hard-working children. I took up exercise, something I hadn’t managed to maintain when the children were little, but which had been a big part of my younger life. I had a sports degree but it was only now that I saw how integral to my spirit cycling the Sussex hills, joining the park run or swimming in the sea were. My life turned around, slowly but surely. I saw friends, travelled, ran a half marathon, fell in love. But still I didn’t sleep. Now, my 4am brain buzzed with excitement. Venetian architecture, a joke with my daughter, my lover’s hands fuelled my wakeful brain at night with delight instead of fear.

One Saturday afternoon in December last year, on the phone to my sister, I mentioned feeling irritated that I didn’t have the energy to go Christmas shopping. “It’s not surprising when you sleep so little,” she replied. I realised both how much I had learned to cope on a few hours a night and that I’d stopped expecting to find a solution. Opening my iPad, I Googled “sleep cure” and scrolled through the first page of familiar remedies and scary sleep “disorder” sites linking insomnia with mental breakdown, migraine and loneliness. On the second page, the phrase “for those for whom nothing ever works”, under a book entitled The Effortless Sleep Method, caught my eye. The details described a guide to “rediscovering your innate ability to sleep without pills, potions or external sleep aids.”

A few days later, the backstory of its British author, Sasha Stephens, had me engrossed. Its tragicomic misery was soberingly familiar. Sasha was not a medic who had studied sleep problems, but a “chronic insomniac” who, after 15 years, found her own solution – and now slept for eight or nine hours. Every night. Sleep, she says, is natural and normal and we can all do it. We just have to learn how.

I spent the Christmas holidays following her 12-point plan, getting up at the same time every morning, as well as writing and reciting affirmations to “tell a positive story of sleep”. My favourite affirmation was: my body knows how to sleep. Having already burrowed deep into my mind, I knew the power of changing habitual thoughts and the determination it takes to do that. It meant my mind – with the multifarious ways its insidious drive for control insinuates itself – didn’t need to get involved. And when it tried, as it surely would, did and does, I now knew to ignore it.

By far the toughest task was getting out of bed when I woke in the night. Your body must learn, says Sasha, that bed is for sleep or sex only. If you lie awake for more than around 20 minutes – which you must guess at, because not looking at a clock is one of the 12 points – you get up and do something calming. She suggests cleaning. I huddled on the floor and wrote affirmations.

I didn’t make it to a night’s sleep in the month she said it would take. In fact, it took me three to get a single seven-hour night, but the blissful, unfettered awakeness that followed that full night’s sleep was encouraging and so, after that, I upgraded to Sasha’s online course, sleepforlife.com. On I ploughed, blindly optimistic that her premise – that sleep is a normal, natural activity that our bodies know how to do – would prove correct.

Short nights continued. I would get up at 6am, my fixed getting-up time, after just a few hours of sleep, and sit on my bedroom floor, my body tender to touch and my head, cloudy with fatigue, telling me that none of this was working and that I really must be careful not to do too much today. I should take it easy and get to bed early. I listened to Sasha instead. After a bad night, she says, I must do more in the day, go for a longer run, see more people. Her advice defied all the messages clogging my furred-up brain. But I trusted her. She had also taken a cautious, energy- saving approach during her own insomnia before a bout of unprecedented exercise during a boot-camp style holiday revealed to her the key to sleep: she had to stop obsessing about getting enough sleep and spend a part of every day doing physical activity.

In my own switch from a tendency towards caution to a seize-the-day mentality, I immediately felt a lift, a murmur of excitement, the stirrings of vitality. I pulled on shorts, did up my trainers and stepped out into the day, running along the seafront, into the light, powering my system with fresh air, toughening my bones with impact… and tiring my body in preparation for sleep that night. The daytime is for activities, for challenges, night-time is for sleep: this was what I was teaching my body. With more blind optimism.

One particularly groggy morning, my limbs throbbed more than usual, my skin winced when my fingers brushed it and my throat and glands raged. The toughness of Sasha’s programme, designed to be followed for a single month, was taking its toll after five. Daring myself to relax the rules, I stopped getting up in the night when I woke, cut exercising to five times a week and, at weekends, set my alarm an hour later, to 7am. And I listened over and over to Sasha’s finely tuned mind exercises, using them in the early hours when my thoughts were free-wheeling… The freezer is clogged with ice, I need to hire a car, take the contents to my mum’s, then bring it back the next day. Have to write myself a note…

The memory of my dad, a working-class boy who became a philosopher, saying, with a glint in his eye, “I’m paid to think”, was not lost of me… Is thinking an indulgence? A middle-class one? Einstein wouldn’t have said so. But then he was a man. So he got to think about interesting things. Women still do most of the thinking about domestics…

Damn. I’m lost in thoughts again. A slight tension in my neck. I remember that that’s OK. “Allow it,” Sasha’s voice now. “Feel it.” Muscles all over my body relaxed. Focus the attention, Sasha says, on the body, not a specific part of it but the body as a whole, the energy of it just inside. A moment later, a faint rushing. The movement of my blood. It was carrying me. I sank a little deeper into the mattress.

The seven-hour nights became more frequent – once or twice a week. But when one morning, in the sixth month, I woke knowing I had been awake earlier in the night and had therefore drifted back to sleep, I knew things were really shifting. The waking was ceasing to become so abrupt and absolute and one Sunday morning, after sleeping a solid seven hours, I spent another two dozing – a deliriously happy twilight state in which I was both aware of and yet fully immersed in a deliciously relaxed slumber.

By now I have had had a few email exchanges with Sasha but I wanted to meet her, see her in the flesh, ask her things. How could I get seven or even eight-hour nights, all the time? Should I go back to getting up in the middle of the night? Exercise more? And I wanted to look her in the eye and ask if she really slept for eight to nine hours a night. By some quirk of fate it transpired we lived in the same town, so one day she came to my house. Opening my front door, it was all I could do not to hug and kiss this diminutive woman I’d never met before, but who had held my hand through dark nights for 11 months.

“When I got to your stage of having a whole night’s sleep several times,” Sasha told me, “I did just one thing. I paid absolutely no attention to ‘it’ whatsoever. I pretended it wasn’t there. I decided I’m not going to give up another second of my life to this ridiculous problem. You are still paying too much attention to it just by having this conversation with me. You’re already better.”

I knew the truth of what she was saying. It had been my mind all along that had prevented me from sleeping. Which means it’s within my grasp to do something about it. But tackling that incredibly complex piece of wiring and its capacity to evade reason was no small task.

She explained: “The body has a self-righting mechanism, which will come out when the circumstances are right – mainly when you stop thinking about sleep, because sleeping is not something you have to do, it’s something that happens naturally. If, today, you forgot you ever had a sleep problem you’d sleep for eight hours a night for the rest of your life. More than anything, tell a positive story of sleep. Fake it until you make it.”

I had evidence that she was right. I had slept on enough nights to know both that I could and that I would sleep the whole night through. Those were the thoughts and memories I would fill my head with.

I wasn’t finished with Stephens yet. “Do you ever relapse?” I asked her. “No,” she replied immediately. “I did for quite a long time afterwards. But now, this year, I haven’t had a bad night once.” What about a run of bad nights? She looked up, thinking. “It hasn’t happened for years now.”

I had one last nagging doubt to clear. I told her about my low-grade, constant anxiety.

“That’s probably the case for the majority of the western world,” she replied. “It’s certainly true for me and I would say that that’s a separate issue to sleep itself. I still get stressed, but it doesn’t interfere with my sleep. My bed is my happy place where I let everything else go.”

The relief that I didn’t need to fix any lingering patterns of anxiety in order to sleep was immense. And her assertion that “it’s bright, high-energy, over-thinker-type people” who were more likely to struggle was another nail in the “mad-woman” hypothesis coffin.

I thanked her and said goodbye, marvelling that she’d drunk coffee during her visit in the afternoon. And, as I made dinner that evening, I chuckled, imagining Sasha’s reaction if I’d told her that someone once told me my red-check duvet cover was the problem. Those deep strong colours hovered in my mind now. I saw them adorning my bed, inviting me, making that corner of my bedroom, beneath a sloping ceiling, into a sanctuary, a place of peace, the haven I would curl into each night, that would pull me into a deep, restorative, blissful unconsciousness.

A month later, I continue to wake gently, gradually, most mornings, and if it’s early I usually drift back to sleep. When worrying thoughts begin, I welcome them. As Jalaluddin Rumi says in his poem The Guest House: I “meet them at the door laughing and invite them in”. Mostly. And, during the day, I dance as if nobody is watching.

Donald Trump says he gets four. Margaret Thatcher, on the other hand, managed with just three. Two solid arguments, then, for getting enough hours of proper sleep – somewhere between six and eight for we mere mortals, according to experts in the burgeoning field that is sleep science.

And not just a science. Sleep is big business, worth some £30bn globally and growing consistently by 8% a year, say the management consultants McKinsey. Deluxe mattress makers, herbal remedy concoctors, manufacturers of electronic sleep trackers, writers of self-help books, all are cashing in on our seeming inability to close our eyes and fall effortlessly into the embrace of Hypnos.

The South Koreans, who have turned insomnia into a national art form, have a term for the massive commercial edifice built on the simple goal of attaining nightly oblivion: sleeponomics.

We are suffering a sleep crisis, according to this booming industry, drained by overlong working hours, assailed by ubiquitous communications invading the supposed sanctuary of home and, when we finally fall exhausted into the sack, tortured by racing minds, victims of chronic job insecurity and the ridiculous demands of dumb macho management still buzzing around in our heads at 1am.

Think-tank Rand Europe claimed in 2016 that sleeplessness was costing Britain 200,000 lost working days and £40bn a year – 1.86% of GDP and not far short of the then defence budget. This calculation assumes that endemic sleep deprivation translates directly into absenteeism and reduced productivity. It is also said to kill people: Rand cited research showing that adults sleeping fewer than six hours per night were 13% more likely to die early than those getting seven to nine hours. The World Health Organisation thinks seven is the minimum for a good night’s sleep, but the average in Britain is just 6.49 hours, according to the National Sleep Foundation, which campaigns for the Great British kip.

“We are in a sleeplessness epidemic,” claims Dr Guy Meadows, co-founder and clinical director of the Sleep School, which runs a chain of insomnia clinics. “Tiredness,” he asserts, “is the new norm.”

Colin Espie is not so sure. Professor of sleep medicine at Oxford University’s Nuffield Department of Clinical Neuroscience, he argues that sleep deprivation is nothing new. “The idea that challenges with sleep are a modern phenomenon is manifestly ridiculous,” he says. “People have had much more stressful lives historically than they have in the modern west. Life for people in the past, faced with a lack of clean water and food, was stressful. Electric light, international flight and travel between time zones… these can add additional pressure to some extent. Light from your phone may theoretically have a sleep delaying effect, but not really an effect on insomnia. Light effect in labs relates to a small number of minutes, a bit of a difference but not terribly important. These things are not important triggers to insomnia.”

This has not stopped the inhabitants of South Korea, home of Samsung, seeking electronic solutions to their nocturnal malaise. South Koreans sleep 40 minutes less than the global average, according to the OECD and, in 2015, 721,000 of them were suffering sleep disorders, up from 325,000 in 2011. Cue an industry for sleep-related goods and services worth £1.4bn.

Infinitely adjustable “motion beds”, black-out curtains, memory-form pillows, soothing facial sprays, heated eye masks, smart bands supposedly measuring one’s biorhythmic state, this most industrious of nations deploys no end of gizmos to attain that most natural of states. There are sleep pods, also, situated in business districts, providing office workers with a place to cat-nap.

“Tracking devices claim to model the architecture of sleep, but they are not medical devices,” says Espie. “There is very little evidence in medical literature on the veracity of their makers’ claims.”

Sleep deprivation, he explains, falls into two categories: lack of sleep caused by lack of opportunity – simply too much to do in waking hours; and the inability to sleep when the opportunity arises. Tossing and turning in bed, to put it another way. About one in five adults is estimated to suffer from chronic sleeplessness at some stage of their lives.

“Over the past three decades we have come to understand the fundamental importance of sleep,” he says. “Mental and emotional state, metabolic function, all depend on sleep patterns. Chronically mis-timed sleep – people constantly fighting the clock over long periods – we know to be damaging. For example, there is a greater risk of cancer in airline aircrew crossing time zones, and in night shift workers.”

Instability in the circadian rhythm, the 24-hour body cycle, is known to impair signalling in the immune system, making sleep-deprived people more vulnerable to illness. This daily process is observable even in a single cell. Impaired judgement, anxiety, depression, hypertension, diabetes, all are associated with chronic sleep disorders. If you have had difficulty sleeping on three or more nights per week for at least three months and your difficulty sleeping is troubling you, you may be suffering from insomnia disorder.

“In a sense, sleep is the preferred state of the brain,” argues Espie. “The brain does some of its most important work during sleep: repairing, regulating, laying down memory and managing growth. Sleep is a varied and productive time. Saying that you do not need sleep is like saying you do not need clean air, water and nutrition.”

Treatment for sleep disorders has been dominated by medication, some 12m prescriptions for insomnia being written each year. But sleeping pills carry the risk of side-effects. Espie has helped devise the Sleepio app, available via the NHS, which guides users through a programme of cognitive behavioural therapy, helping them overcome “racing mind” and other pitfalls.

“Think of insomnia as a kind of sleep preoccupation syndrome,” says Espie, who warns that tracking devices may do the opposite of good. “People get caught up in monitoring: ‘Am I asleep? What time is it?’ This turning of something meant to happen automatically into an issue can result in a vicious cycle. A good sleeper is oblivious to all of this, has no skills and sleeps quite naturally.

“Compare sleeping to breathing: your first preoccupation when learning to scuba dive is ‘How do I breathe underwater?’ Well, you breathe just like you do when you are not diving. Overthinking the issue results in it becoming problematic.”

People need different amounts of sleep – just as they vary in height, weight and shoe size. Adults require between six and eight hours generally, with a slight tapering off in the need for sleep as one enters old age. Sleepio aims to teach you how much sleep you as an individual require, and how to establish a healthy sleep pattern with techniques like thought-blocking, which helps banish recurring anxious thoughts.

The modern world makes a fetish out of measurement but attempts to understand the still-mysterious world of sleep can result in the opposite of what is desired. Dr Sabra Abbott, a professor of neurology and sleep medicine at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in the United States, says a new breed of patient has started seeking her help.

“Their primary concern was that their tracker was telling them they weren’t getting the right amount or right type of sleep,” she explained. “It seems that the device was creating a sleep problem that may not have otherwise been there.”",0.9889,

130,UK news,'It's a room of lawyers': what have we learnt from the Grenfell Tower inquiry?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/09/grenfell-tower-fire-public-inquiry-phase-one-lessons-of-hillsborough,2018-12-09T09:00:12Z,"In giving evidence to the Grenfell Tower inquiry last month, Robert Black, chief executive of the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO), which was responsible for the tower block, could not recall very much of the most fateful night of his life.

Black, a Scot who had worked in housing management throughout his 27-year career, could not confirm to within an hour what time he arrived at the scene of the fire by taxi from his home in south London. He could not remember if he had been asked for plans of the burning building by the London fire brigade, and did not know if any had been sent. Despite having been released on full pay last year to assist the inquiry (before resigning last December), he could bring to mind hardly any detail about the sequence of emails or conversations between himself and his team on the ground that night. And he professed no knowledge of why the information sent to the fire service operations room about the residents of Grenfell, in particular the location of vulnerable or disabled occupants of the tower, was 15 years out of date. Largely, he said, speaking of his role in the emergency operation, “you are almost there as a spare part”.

One detail of the chief executive’s evidence that did emerge in black and white was an email he wrote at 6am, about five hours after the Grenfell fire had been started by a faulty fridge-freezer in a flat on the tower’s fourth floor.

The email was sent from Black’s Samsung phone to colleagues on the executive committee of the KCTMO. The subject of the email was “fire”. It noted that Black was already being asked questions, principally by the leader of the council, Nick Paget-Brown, and its housing director, Rock Feilding-Mellen, “about the cladding and spec. Questions about how [the fire] spread.” His colleagues needed to provide answers and “to pull some of this together pretty fast in terms of health and safety compliance”, Black wrote, with the fire still consuming Grenfell’s 24 storeys in front of him and with the list of dead and missing growing ever longer. “We need all the information about the refurbishment, as this will be a primary focus.”

In studying that email, projected on a large screen on the wall of the inquiry’s ad hoc court room, Richard Millett QC, the lead counsel, looked professionally puzzled. Millett is a man who, in questioning fire fighters, survivors, expert witnesses and council employees every working day for six months, has maintained the same polite, inquisitorial tone, like a village GP asking for symptoms from an anxious patient. His chief weapon in indicating mild disquiet during this gruelling evidence-gathering process has been the pregnant pause. Millett employed one of these as he looked at the email on the screen. Why had Black sent that email to his team, he eventually wondered.

“Well,” Black replied, “when Nick Paget-Brown and that came they were asking – because obviously, you know, it looked like the cladding was an issue. All I was trying to do was pull together some pointers of what we would have to prepare for [the council], or ultimately for an inquiry, of which we knew there would be one, by that time.”

That latter understanding, that the “terrible and shocking scene” the chief executive witnessed on arrival at the tower would inevitably lead here, to a nondescript room behind the raw red facade of the old Prudential Assurance building in Holborn, London, seemed to betray a fundamental rule of public life in Britain. In extremis, this is how that world works. When very bad things happen, those directly involved would sit somewhere like this, 18 months or two years down the line, in front of a polite QC and a retired judge and a bank of lawyers with box files, and try, often in vain, over the course of an afternoon, to knot their brows and recall their part in the tragic events in question.

That understanding – that the horrific tragedy would lead inevitably, in the first instance, to a public inquiry – was not immediately grasped by the survivors of the Grenfell fire, or by the bereaved, whose mothers and fathers and sons and daughters and brothers and sisters were among the 72 who died.

One thing the inquiry process could have done better initially, according to Moyra Samuels, a local resident and teacher who has led the pressure group Justice4Grenfell since the day after the fire, was to explain to the families exactly what an inquiry was. Some people assumed it was a grand investigation that could lead directly to prosecutions, like the Mueller inquiry in the US. Others feared it would be an opaque process of information gathering politically designed for obfuscation and delay.

Natasha Elcock escaped from the 11th floor of the tower with her six-year-old daughter and boyfriend. They had been trapped in her flat for 90 minutes, as part of the fire brigade’s “stay put” policy, and rang for help nearly 100 times before the fire crews reached them and helped them, through the black smoke and chaos of the desperate and the dying, downstairs. Elcock, a retail manager, now chairs the Grenfell United group of survivors and bereaved families. “Initially,” she told me last week, “because we had never been involved in something like this, the inquiry was all a bit of the unknown. I suppose I had a sense that the aim of it was to get to how things happen and why things happen – but for us there was the fact that more than 70 people died that night, in our view essentially murdered. We were all about people being arrested and we didn’t want any inquiry to hinder that.”

The Grenfell inquiry is now six months into a process that is expected to last two more years. Next week, phase one of its remit, which has gathered documentary evidence and interrogated core participants over statements about the events of the night itself, will come to an end. The presiding chair, Martin Moore-Bick, will publish a preliminary report, which may lead to some immediate statutory changes, for example in building regulations relating to cladding, and in updated guidance to firefighters dealing with high-rise fires. Sometime soon after Christmas, the second phase will ratchet slowly into motion, trying to find answers to the wider questions about why the fire took hold, and to apportion blame for what happened. Criminal prosecutions from a concurrent Met investigation may or may not follow. This is, then, another moment to take stock. To see if the inquiry into an event that was asked by some to act as metaphor for three decades of political failings in social housing policy is likely to provide any meaningful answers.

The precedents are not all encouraging. The public inquiry – first used as an instrument for the Tay Bridge disaster, which killed 75 people in 1879 (it found that the bridge had been “badly designed, badly built and badly maintained”, though no prosecutions followed) – is one of Britain’s genuine growth industries. Between 1990 and 2017, 69 inquiries were launched. Since 1997, there have never been fewer than three running at any one time; in late 2010, a record 16 inquiries were on the go. Those inquiries made thousands of recommendations, but their implementation is largely undocumented and patchy. Lord Shutt of Greetland, chair of the committee on the Inquiries Act 2005 – an inquiry into inquiries – noted that when a new inquiry is carried out, often at huge expense, “it’s as though previous ones had never happened”.

If the Grenfell residents could ever be described as lucky, you might point to the fact that the commissioning of their inquiry coincided with one of the most damning reports into the tone and conduct of British public life ever published. James Jones, the former bishop of Liverpool, who for more than two decades had acted as an advocate and friend of those who lost loved ones at Hillsborough, pulled no punches with his account of how that long process had treated the bereaved. He called his report, commissioned by then home secretary Theresa May, “The patronising disposition of unaccountable power”.

Traditionally, the remit of a public inquiry is concerned with three questions: What happened? Who is to blame? And what can be done to prevent this happening again? In the course of his 25 recommendations, Jones argued for the inclusion of a fourth: a commitment not only to treat bereaved families and survivor families with utmost dignity during the process, but to be seen as treating them with utmost dignity. To recognise that inquiries must have a therapeutic value as well as a forensic value.

The Grenfell inquiry is a test case of those recommendations. Not long after Jones’s report came out, the families of Grenfell United contacted the retired bishop to invite him to come to consult with them. At the same time, the new leader of Kensington and Chelsea council also wrote to Jones, asking if he could visit the council, too, to share insights into what the 200 traumatised families might be going through. One afternoon at the beginning of the year, he shuttled between both groups.

There were subsequent meetings. At one, the families of Grenfell United said they wanted the council to sign up to the charter for families bereaved through public tragedy that had been part of Jones’s report. The charter includes a pledge to “avoid seeking to defend the indefensible or to dismiss or disparage those who may have suffered where we have fallen short”. The council became the first body to sign the charter. A significant number of others have followed, including the Crown Prosecution Service. Lord Kerslake, when conducting his review of the Manchester Arena killings, encouraged all the main agencies involved to sign up to it; some did, some didn’t.

One of the primary impacts of Jones’s insistence of putting the grief and anger of the families at the heart of the process was a change of emphasis in the proceedings. The Grenfell inquiry opened with two weeks of moving commemorative tributes to those who had died, from those who knew them best and loved them most, all attended by the inquiry chair, Moore-Bick, and the team of lawyers.

The format softened the attitude that many of the Grenfell survivors and bereaved had toward Moore-Bick. Initially, he had seemed an establishment chair out of central casting (between 1990 and 2017 there have only been six inquiries with a female chair, for example; 14 of the inquiries over that period were chaired by someone called either Anthony or William.) The choice of Moore-Bick was questioned by groups including Justice4Grenfell because of a 2014 judgment, dug up from the archives, in which he had allowed Westminster council to rehouse a tenant in Milton Keynes, 50 miles away from her home. Confronted with the case, the judge said: “I was rather surprised to see myself described as controversial.” At his first public meeting with the families, he left the stage with questions still being yelled from the floor. The commemorations changed that relationship.

The survivors I have spoken to expressed their sense that hearing firsthand about those who had lost their lives changed the body language of the judge (who sometimes appears to have modelled his studied courtesies on those of John Major). “When you sit up close to him now in that room,” Elcock says, “there are lot of signs that you can see in how he takes evidence. He often asks additional questions to make sure he has a full understanding. Since the commemorations I think he is really engaged with this and has a real commitment to get it right.”

If the tone of the questioning has proved empathetic to the core participants in the tragedy, there are other aspects of the proceedings that in their eyes still fall short. The choice of Holborn as a venue for the inquiry was bitterly opposed by the family groups, who have to travel half way across London to attend. And the geography of the room itself seems to marginalise their involvement. “When you go up there,” Elcock says, “it’s a room full of lawyers, and the families somewhere off to the side.”

Other recent inquiries have changed this traditional arrangement. In the ongoing inquiry into contaminated blood, Sir Brian Langstaff, the chair, announced in his opening remarks that “this won’t be run for the benefit of lawyers but for the benefit of those affected. So the room won’t be designed so the view of the public is obscured by ranks of lawyers.” The Grenfell survivors still hope that some greater accommodation of this kind can be made for them in phase two of the proceedings.

At the heart of James Jones’s analysis of the “patronising disposition” of public inquiries was the identification of “a mindset which defines how organisations and people within them behave… One of its core features is an instinctive prioritisation of the reputation of an organisation over the citizen’s right to expect people to be held to account for their actions.”

It would be fair to say that, so far in the Grenfell inquiry, the authority figures from various agencies who have appeared to give evidence are still struggling with that principle. The quotation out of all the days of evidence that most seemed to define that mindset came from Dany Cotton, commissioner of the London fire brigade.

After weeks of evidence from firefighters who had performed often heroic actions despite a lack of breathing apparatus and with broken radio communications, despite the contentious delay in ordering the evacuation of the tower and an absence of previous checks on the building, Cotton bluntly told the inquiry that, with hindsight: “I wouldn’t change anything we did on the night.”

Sitting in the courtroom along with other members of Grenfell United, Elcock recalls how she felt “the angriest on hearing that that I had felt since 14 June 2017. She wouldn’t change a thing? She did an injustice to the people that she manages by saying that. Because they still go out every day risking their lives, and she thinks nothing should be changed?”

The tight-lipped testimony from figures such as Cotton and Black stood in contrast to the 32 days of deposition from survivors and their relatives. They relived the minute details of the trauma that had haunted them for more than a year. On the days I sat listening, in the adjoining media room, the repetitive account of smoke-filled corridors and the orange glow outside their windows was punctuated in each case by sudden and terrible human drama. The heartbreaking account of Paulos Tekle, who lost his young son, Isaac, who had been holding the hand of a neighbour as they descended the stairs from their 18th-floor flat; or the final words, played to the courtroom, of Mohammed Neda, 57, who was among those who fell to their deaths from the upper floors of the building: “We are leaving this world now, goodbye. I hope I haven’t disappointed you. Goodbye to all.” Most of the recorded conversations between those who lost their lives in the fire and the control room operators who sought to give them advice or comfort were told in transcript rather than played as audio, because they were too traumatic to hear, but their contents were no less devastating.

Those days of evidence have rarely made headline news. The inquiry, like everything else, has been swamped and overwhelmed by Brexit, except – as with the appalling bonfire night party – when something beyond the confines of the process disturbs its steady progress. The BBC’s daily podcast has offered an often telling summation of events, but the survivors and the bereaved are understandably dismayed that days and weeks of startling testimony have gone by at the inquiry with barely a ripple on the surface of the national conversation.

They retain a moving faith in the process, however. Tiago Alves escaped from the fire with his young sister and parents, who helped to evacuate their floor of Grenfell, ignoring the “stay put” advice. Alves is studying physics at King’s College London but has taken a year out to try to help keep on top of the scientific aspects of the 378,000 documents that have been submitted. “I have done my best to use the scientific method to try to explain some of it to the Grenfell United committee or the membership,” he says. “My primary subject is physics, but I have done a lot of chemistry, so I hope that is helpful.”

I wonder, talking to him, what he has made of the pedantic manner in which Millett, the lead counsel, has asked survivors to relive their trauma, dwelling in endless detail on the nature of the smoke or the remembered layout of rooms.

“I will answer this in two hats,” Alves says. “From my survivor perspective, quite often I feel frustrated that they are homing in on the wrong details. But with my scientific hat, I believe that they are collecting this evidence to use at a later stage with another witness. It may seem very pedantic, but I want to believe that they know what they are doing. With the expert reports they are constantly cross referencing. You see them starting to weave a story…”

And he is confident that they are pulling at the right threads?

“You hope so. It is not until you see the finished work that you will know. This is the thing, though. We are the real experts on what happened that night. If we don’t use our expertise in the right way, nothing will change.”

The first test of that belief will come in the interim report from Moore-Bick, to be delivered in the coming weeks. The second phase of the inquiry, along with criminal investigations by the Metropolitan police, is where the survivors place their true faith, however. The questions it seeks to answer are many of those voiced in incredulity and anger on the night of the blaze itself, the kind of questions that Robert Black hoped his colleagues might be able to answer in his 6am email.

Again, there is a hope that the process might be alive to a change in emphasis of the kind recommended by James Jones. In the past, the expected outcomes of an inquiry have often been ludicrously vague. The terms of reference for the 2003 Hutton inquiry merely stated that the inquiry was to “urgently conduct an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr Kelly.” For the Chilcot inquiry, which lasted seven years and cost £13m, it was “to identify the lessons to be learnt from the Iraq conflict”.

Following consultations with all parties, there are 13 stated specific areas of investigation for the second phase of Grenfell, and multiple subsets of specific questions to be answered in each. Some of these questions jump out more than others. The judge may pay particular attention, for example, to: “What elements or aspects of the exterior of the building at the time of the fire failed to comply with what elements or aspects of what regulations, legislation, British Standards, guidance, industry practice, and in each case to what extent?” And: “Who was responsible for such failures?” Or: “Assess the adequacy of the LFB’s actions (including the application of the “stay-put” policy)…”

Andrew O’Hagan’s controversial report in the London Review of Books, which was published the day before the inquiry opened, sought to pre-empt Moore-Bick’s efforts. Based on dozens of interviews with many of those who subsequently gave evidence to the inquiry, O’Hagan’s 60,000-word story came to reflect a frustration with subjectivity itself. Everyone, it seemed to the author, sought to use the fire to reinforce his or her own ideology. That he has not been forgiven for the perceived hubris of that conclusion – he acquired the nickname Andrew O’Hateful at Justice4Grenfell – in some senses adds weight to it. “Tories,” O’Hagan wrote, of those seeking to find lessons in the fire, “bestowed on themselves a pure paternalism that forgave their remoteness from a portion of the people they were employed to serve. The Corbynites took every opportunity to make the tragedy exemplify their core message, but they had to be selective in order to do that. The firefighters, and the unions, argued that every failing on the night could be put down to government cuts, closures and privatisations. The ordinary punters meanwhile pinned their colours either to group heroism on the night or to individual acts of depravity – as if the tower was pre-eminently a locus of truth about Britain today.”

In one respect, no doubt, O’Hagan’s pre-emptive report performed a useful function for the inquiry proper. The reaction to it was a further sobering example for the intensely sober Moore-Bick. The judge will know that there is nothing he can conclude that will please everybody. He will also know too, perhaps, from the moment that the inquiry began with its commemorations, that he has a unique opportunity to do right by the survivors and the bereaved and the 72 dead and, in doing so, return some real confidence to the inquiry process itself. Elcock and the families of Grenfell United have to believe that is the case. In what they know will be a long fight for nuanced truth, a fight that began in the choking smoke on the stairwells of the tower block, they are fully prepared, she says, “to keep holding our breaths until justice is done”.",-0.9988,

132,Technology,"Huawei, sanctions and software: everything you need to know",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/08/huawei-sanctions-software-what-you-need-to-know,2018-12-08T16:00:50Z,"Why is Huawei in the news?

Its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who is also the daughter of the company’s founder, was arrested in Canada on 1 December and faces extradition to the US over allegations of helping evade sanctions against Iran. The Obama-era sanctions banned the sales of certain telephone-system equipment.

What does Huawei do?

It is the world’s biggest telecoms equipment supplier, with 2017 revenues of 603bn yuan (£67.7bn) and profits of 47.4bn yuan (£5.3bn). One part of it makes the networking equipment that makes mobile phone masts work, the network switches that connect phone networks and the software to control them. Since 2015, it has outsold Ericsson and Nokia, its two main rivals, and is far bigger than ZTE (another Chinese company) or South Korea’s Samsung, which also challenge in that space. It’s also one of the world’s three largest smartphone vendors, vying with Apple for second place, which it has held for the past two quarters.

Where is its equipment used?

Its network equipment is used almost everywhere – but not in the US, which has banned its 5G kit. Australia and New Zealand are taking similar moves, decreeing that it cannot be used in 5G networks. In the UK, BT uses Huawei systems extensively, though not in its central network.

Is the Meng arrest connected to the US’s trade war with China?

No. The arrest seems to be connected to the alleged sale of Huawei equipment in Iran, breaking US sanctions. American suspicions of sales being made via intermediary companies were raised in 2016, after documents from ZTE came to light. Those talked about a company codenamed “F7” which, like ZTE, was selling equipment to sanctioned countries including Syria, North Korea, Cuba and Iran. Other details in the documents point to “F7” being Huawei.

What does Huawei say about F7 and claims it broke sanctions?

Huawei says it “complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU”.

Are sanctions the only bad news?

There are storm clouds elsewhere. In the UK alone, BT is removing Huawei systems from the core of the mobile network EE, which it purchased in 2016. And the head of MI6, Alex Younger, said last week that the UK needs to decide “the extent to which we are going to be comfortable” with Chinese companies owning technologies such as the forthcoming super-fast 5G networks. The concern is that letting foreign companies install and in effect control infrastructure via software would make an attack possible at a time of heightened tension.

In December 2015 Ukraine suffered a huge power outage affecting 230,000 people due to a cyber-attack on its power stations, sown via targeted phishing emails that broke into their computers; Russia has been blamed. In 2015 and 2016 state hackers working for North Korea stole millions of dollars by breaking into banks’ systems in Bangladesh.

Why are countries so concerned?

The fear is that Huawei may have built in a “backdoor” to its network software (or could be compelled to) that would allow covert surveillance or control – or even destruction – of phone networks, which are by their nature accessible via the internet. So if Huawei equipment were used, the only protection would be to ensure the software that runs the network was secure.

How can you check that its software is secure?

Since 2010, in an arrangement with BT, Huawei has provided an office in Oxfordshire called “The Cell” where its code can be checked by a team including GCHQ experts. But recently The Cell has come in for criticism because it’s not possible to be certain that Huawei loads the same code on to the machines it deploys elsewhere. “The code you audit might work OK, but how do you know that what’s evaluated is what ends up in the BT network?” Professor Alan Woodward of the University of Surrey told the BBC last week. The worst-case scenario was “espionage or disruption via a back door”, he added.

What does Huawei say about these concerns?

Huawei has repeatedly said such fears are overblown, that it complies with local laws and that it would not hand over user data to China. Its Australian chairman, John Lord, said an order to hand over user data to the Chinese government would be “completely illegal” and fumed at Huawei being blocked from the 5G network, calling it “short-term and small-minded”.

133,Technology,The giant that no one trusts: why Huawei’s history haunts it,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/08/the-giant-that-no-one-trusts-why-huaweis-history-haunts-it,2018-12-08T15:59:49Z,"Many executives consider themselves figures of great significance, but few are capable of sending a chill through global markets simply by getting arrested. Meng Wanzhou, also known as Sabrina Meng or Cathy Meng, is one.

The chief financial officer of the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei – and the daughter of its billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei – was detained in Vancouver last week. She could face extradition to the US on charges thought to be related to allegations that Huawei breached sanctions levied by Washington against Iran.

Meng’s arrest, and Beijing’s demand that she be released amid allegations of “hooliganism” from the Chinese media, has dashed hopes of a thaw in US-China trade tensions. Chances of a rapprochement had appeared to be on the rise following a 90-day tariff truce agreed between the two countries at the recent G20 summit in Buenos Aires.

Stock markets in the US, UK and Europe – already skittish during this parlous period for relations between the world’s two biggest economies – gyrated on Tuesday and Thursday as investors considered the possibility of a fresh tariff escalation undermining an already fragile global economy.

While its finance director’s arrest has placed the company squarely at the centre of world affairs, Huawei is no stranger to being scrutinised with open distrust. It has been banned from involvement in the installation of 5G mobile networks in India, New Zealand and Australia, blocked from making acquisitions in the US and banned from selling phones on military bases by the Pentagon.

There is no official prohibition in the UK, but BT has excluded Huawei telecoms infrastructure from its own 5G rollout and removed some of its equipment from the 4G network.

Concerns about Huawei seem to emanate, at least in part, from the history of its 74-year-old founder, Ren , who has long had ties with both the People’s Liberation Army, where he served as an engineer, and the Communist party. Moreover, his company has grown into a globe-straddling colossus, the world’s largest telecoms equipment manufacturer, selling in 170 countries. It also overtook Apple earlier this year to become the world’s second-largest smartphone manufacturer behind Samsung, churning out 54m handsets in three months.

But however great its success, Huawei has never been able to dispel the cloud of suspicion that hangs over both Ren and his creation. Given the volume of espionage and cyber-attacks that originate in China – targeting nations and companies alike – questions have inevitably been raised about the security implications of using Huawei’s technology.

It is, after all, a company founded by a military tech expert. Concern has focused on whether Huawei’s kit could be used to spy on foreign competitors, steal intellectual property or even install “kill switches” in energy or industrial projects. Some analysts have warned that, in the event of a conflict, Beijing could exploit hidden backdoors in Huawei technology to shut down a foreign power’s infrastructure at the touch of a button.

Ren himself has, in his relatively rare public appearances, sought to dismiss such concerns as scaremongering. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2015, he told an audience: “There’s no way we can possibly penetrate into other people’s systems and we have never received such a request from the Chinese government.”

That, of course, is exactly what you’d expect a spy to say.

But the real question isn’t so much whether Huawei is a covert espionage operation but whether it could be coerced into becoming one. For a start, Chinese companies – and Huawei is no exception – typically have a Communist party committee within their corporate architecture. What these committees do, or how much influence they wield, is hard to gauge.

A new national intelligence law that came into force last year may be of even greater concern. Article seven of the law states: “All organisations and citizens shall, in accordance with the law, support, cooperate with, and collaborate in national intelligence work, and guard the secrecy of national intelligence work they are aware of.

“The state will protect individuals and organisations that support, cooperate with, and collaborate in national intelligence work.”

Alarming conditions such as these lend some credence to Huawei’s bogeyman status among governments, even in the absence of any hard evidence to support their fears.

The company has gone to great lengths to address its image problem, hiring legions of PR advisers and allowing GCHQ to run the rule over its tech at a special centre in Banbury, Oxfordshire. The company even hired the British government’s former chief information officer John Suffolk as its global cyber-security officer.

Suffolk himself has pointed out that any fears about Huawei ought to equally apply to any firm that has a role in projects of national significance. “Believe no one and check everything,” he told the Economist.

Huawei’s problem appears to be that no matter how closely it is examined, the facts of its founder’s past – coupled with the global importance of telecoms – mean it can never be given the benefit of the doubt.

According to Ren, the company’s name comes from a patriotic slogan that he saw on a wall one day: zhonghua youwei, or “China makes a difference”. Unfortunately for Huawei, that difference appears to be an aura of mistrust that is nigh-on impossible to escape.

The arrest of Huawei’s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou has thrown a new spotlight not only on the company but also on its founder: her father, Ren Zhengfei.

Much of the doubt surrounding Huawei stems from Ren’s background in the People’s Liberation Army between 1974 and 1983, where he was an engineer.

Ren’s rags-to-riches rise is part of Huawei’s official narrative. The 74-year-old grew up poor, the son of teachers in a remote mountainous town in the south-western province of Guizhou. He studied at the Chongqing Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture and later joined the military “by chance” in the 1970s, when fabric was being rationed and the government was recruiting anyone with a university education to help build equipment to produce synthetic fabric.

After leaving the army, Ren landed in Shenzhen, designated a special economic zone as part of China’s transition to a market economy. He started Huawei with roughly £4,000 in capital from five investors and no obvious plan. “It was not as romantic as you imagine,” he has recalled. “Neither was it so wonderful.”

In 2013, Ren said he had considered renaming his creation. “For many years there has been a debate in our company over whether we should change this name. Recently, we’ve decided not to change it. We are going to teach foreigners how to pronounce it, and not always say it like ‘Hawaii,’” he told the Beijing Times. For the uninitiated, Huawei is pronounced hoo-ah-way.

As his company expanded to become China’s largest tech company by staff, employing more than 180,000 people, Ren maintained a low profile. The bulk of his international media appearances seem aimed at dispelling doubts about his or the company’s connection to the Chinese military.

Yet Ren’s Communist party credentials continue to dog him. He has been a member since 1978, and was invited to attend its 12th national congress in 1982. For the 40th anniversary of China’s reform and opening-up this year, Ren was deemed one of 100 “excellent private entrepreneurs” who “firmly safeguard the leadership of the Chinese Communist party”. Critics also point to the company’s status as one of China’s “national champions” – companies whose global expansion is considered to be in the national interest.

Ren owns about 1% of Huawei and is said to have control over most major decisions, in some cases still running it like a military unit despite supposedly sharing the job with three rotating chief executives. A memo leaked in 2017 called on employees to adopt 21 “military disciplines”.

While Ren has repeatedly said none of his children will succeed him, Meng was seen as being groomed to be her father’s successor.

Wall Street was on course for a second day of heavy losses following news of the detention of Meng Wanzhou, chief global finance officer for the Chinese telecoms company Huawei by Canadian authorities and the request by the US for her extradition to face reported cyber espionage and sanction-breaking charges.

Reports of Wanzhou’s arrest – and China’s demand for her release – led to falls of 2% in the Shanghai and Tokyo markets overnight and the sell-off spread to Europe, where all the main bourses saw losses in their main indices of more than 3%.

Frankfurt’s DAX index has now fallen by more than 20% since its peak – the official definition of a bear market – amid concerns that the country’s manufacturing exporters will be hard hit by an intensification of US-China protectionism....",-0.977,
135,Technology,Huawei faces catastrophe in the technology cold war,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/06/huawei-faces-catastrophe-in-the-technology-cold-war,2018-12-06T12:51:42Z,"The arrest in Canada of the chief financial officer of the Chinese mobile network and handset tech firm Huawei marks a new stage in a technological cold war between western spy agencies and Beijing. This development could be catastrophic for Huawei: according to reports, the US suspects it broke sanctions by selling telecoms equipment to Iran. If that is proven, the response could exclude Huawei from many of the world’s most valuable markets.

That quiet war of words had already begun to ramp up this week when first the head of the UK’s secret service, Alex Younger, said in a speech that “we need to have a conversation” about Huawei’s involvement in the UK’s telecoms network. Then on Wednesday, BT revealed it is stripping out Huawei’s networking kit from parts of the EE mobile network.

Huawei has been the world’s largest telecoms network equipment company since 2015, ahead of European rivals Ericsson and Nokia, and far above domestic competitor ZTE and South Korea’s Samsung.

But the company has for years struggled against suspicions that it has bowed to pressure from the Chinese government to tap or disrupt telecoms systems in foreign countries. That has seen it banned from selling its profitable network equipment to the US, Australia and New Zealand – three of the “Five Eyes” group of intelligence-sharing countries (the other two being the UK and Canada).

But Meng Wanzhou’s arrest on a federal warrant in Canada is a dramatic escalation. As well as being the CFO and deputy chairwoman of one of the world’s largest makers of telecoms networking equipment that is essential to phone, smartphone and internet traffic, she is also the daughter of Huawei’s 74-year-old founder Ren Zhengfei. Ren attracted suspicion from western agencies because of his role working in IT for the Red Army before he set up the firm in 1987.

The latest developments are feeding into a climate of growing suspicion and distrust about Chinese technologies and equipment. The discovery that some smartphone handsets send western users’ data to servers in China raised eyebrows in 2016; increasingly, there are questions about what covert functions might be built into systems. A dramatic story from Bloomberg in October claimed that China had inserted monitoring chips into servers used by Apple and Amazon. That was denied fiercely by the companies, but feeds into a narrative where China’s dominance of technology manufacturing is seen by intelligence agencies as posing a risk to countries entirely dependent on telecoms networks.

Meng’s arrest appears to be part of a case that the US is building against Huawei. The industry already knows how serious that could be: in May the Trump administration instituted a ban against ZTE for breaking a promise not to sell equipment to Iran. The ban prevented any US company selling its equipment to ZTE – and essentially throttled it, because it relies on US-designed chips. At the same time, the UK’s National Cybersecurity Centre, which draws on expertise from the government’s GCHQ spy centre, warned bluntly against using ZTE equipment in UK networks on the grounds that “the national security risks … cannot be mitigated”. ZTE plunged to a billion-dollar loss that quarter.

The US has long suspected that Huawei has also been involved in breaking sanctions. Internal documents seized from ZTE when it was found to be breaking sanctions showed that it knew of another Chinese company, codenamed F7, was doing the same by setting up “cut out” companies to which it would sell equipment. This would then be sold on to the sanctioned country. In one crucial passage, ZTE’s document says that “F7’s proposal to acquire US 3leaf company was opposed by the US government.” In 2010, Huawei sought to acquire 3leaf – but backed away after US government opposition.

Asked if it was the company referred to as F7 in the ZTE document, Huawei said: “Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU.”

If the US can prove that Huawei broke Obama-era sanctions against Iran, it could precipitate a rush of bans against the company. If, like ZTE, it were banned from receiving American parts, its smartphone business, the world’s second largest behind Samsung, would grind to a halt. It may already be preparing for such an eventuality. It makes its own smartphone chips, but still relies on Google’s Android software. News emerged recently that it is working on its own alternative mobile phone operating system. John Delaney, a mobile systems analyst from researchers IDC says that would be sensible: “The American government’s hostility to Huawei means it’s possible that Google could be forbidden to continue licensing Android to the company.”

After this week’s developments, Huawei is looking increasingly isolated.",-0.9914,
136,Technology,Huawei Q&A: what you need to know about the Chinese phone maker,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/06/huawei-qa-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-chinese-phone-maker,2018-12-06T05:55:36Z,"Huawei (pronounced “Wah-Way”) is a telecommunications and electronics company based in Shenzhen in the south of China.

It is also the world’s largest telecoms equipment firm – in August it overtook Apple to become the world’s second-largest smartphone seller behind Samsung. In the second quarter of 2017 the Chinese company sold 54.2m phones, making up 15% of the share of the market.

Though its phones are popular all over the world, Huawei has been blocked by several countries from being involved in supplying equipment for the rollout of 5G networks, with governments citing national security fears.

Already the governments of the US, New Zealand and Australia have moved to block the use of Huawei’s equipment in the rollout of future 5G networks.

US regulations were announced in April that banned government companies buying from any company deemed a security threat, which was thought to be a way of blocking purchases by Huawei and another Chinese manufacturer, ZTE. In July, the US lifted the ban on ZTE as part of a settlement in which the company paid the US Treasury a $1bn penalty.

In August the Australian federal government decided to bar Huawei and ZTE from supplying equipment to Australia’s 5G network, citing national security. New Zealand’s security services also blocked Huawei from supplying mobile network kit to a domestic company on national security grounds in November.

In the UK, telecoms provider BT has just confirmed it is removing Huawei equipment from key areas of its 4G network, amid concern from MI6 about Chinese firms’ presence in such infrastructure.

What are governments worried about?

Huawei is a private company. However there are fears it and other Chinese manufacturers can be compelled by the Chinese security services to help with intelligence gathering. The national intelligence law passed this year requires all organisations and citizens to assist the country’s spy agencies.

Speaking after Australia announced Huawei and ZTE would not be allowed to participate in the 5G rollout, the country’s spy chief said Huawei had been banned because it was a “high-risk vendor”. Mike Burgess, who is director-general of the Australian Signals Directorate, said the 5G network would underpin the country’s water supply, electricity grid, health systems and even self-driving cars, and so breaches due to “high-risk equipment” needed to be guarded against.

Who has been arrested?

On 1 December Canada arrested Huawei’s global chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who is also the daughter of the founder of the company, Ren Zhengfei, an ex-army officer. This year she was promoted to one of four executives who serve as vice chair on a rotating basis, a move many took as a sign Meng was being groomed to take over the company.

She was detained in Vancouver while transferring between flights. A court hearing has been set for Friday. Canadian police have not provided more information about the arrest but Reuters reported that Meng was arrested on suspicion of violating US sanctions against Iran. She faces extradition to the US.

US authorities have been investigating Huawei since at least 2016 for allegedly shipping US-origin products to Iran and other countries in violation of US export and sanctions laws, sources told Reuters in April. Beijing has protested against the arrest of Meng and demanded her release.

What does China say?

The Chinese embassy in Canada released a statement saying China, “firmly opposes and strongly protests over such kind of actions which seriously harmed the human rights of the victim.”

“The Chinese side has lodged stern representations with the US and Canadian side, and urged them to immediately correct the wrongdoing and restore the personal freedom of Ms Meng Wanzhou,” it said in a statement on its website.

The editor of China’s often stridently patriotic state-run tabloid, the Global Times posted on Weibo: “It is clear the US is pushing the battle line to our door… We can completely regard the US arrest of Meng Wanzhou as a declaration of war against China.”

When Australia announced Huawei would not be allowed to be involved in the 5G network, China’s commerce ministry said: “The Australian government has made the wrong decision and it will have a negative impact to the business interests of China and Australia companies.”

In June, Huawei’s Australian chairman John Lord said Huawei would refuse to hand over data on Australian users to China, saying such an order would be “completely illegal”, calling the block of Huawei from the 5G network “short-term and small-minded”, and that many concerns about Huawei were “uninformed or just plain wrong”.",-0.9911,

It takes its design cues from the Fitbit Alta HR tracker, but the Fitbit Ace has several tweaks to make it more child-friendly. Stats that kids shouldn’t be worried about, such as calories burned, aren’t tracked and parents can view the linked Fitbit account. What the Ace does track is steps, sleep and active minutes, encouraging children to get moving. If you also wear a Fitbit tracker, you can even compete against each other to see who clocks the most steps in the app.

Garmin took a little longer than other brands to bring music to its watches, but it has quickly leapt ahead of the pack. It’s incredibly easy to load up and listen to music on the Forerunner 645 Music, but perhaps the bigger selling point for music fans is that Garmin has a partnership with Spotify. This means, if you’re a Spotify Premium user, you can store, stream and update all your existing playlists on the watch. On top of its music offering, the Forerunner 645 Music is also a superb GPS watch with excellent sport and everyday activity tracking.

Best hybrid – for those who want it all

The problem many people have with fitness trackers is that they claim wrist-space that could be taken by more attractive, less sporty-looking timepieces. The Withings Steel offers a compromise, with its stylish watch face hiding a wealth of intelligent sensors that automatically track your steps, sleep and sports such running and swimming. You get subtle feedback on the watch subdial and can dig deeper into your stats in a very slick partner app. The other big plus is that the Withings Steel uses a watch battery, which will last for eight months before it needs changing.

140,Technology,Our top five new smartphones,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/25/smartphones-review-roundup-latest-phones-apple-samsung-google-huawei,2018-11-25T09:00:07Z,"Huawei’s latest phone is something rather special. The Mate 20 Pro packs more cutting-edge technology into it than any other, but unlike most bleeding-edge devices it makes for a great experience.

It looks like an iPhone XS mated with a Samsung Galaxy Note 9, with a huge curved 6.39in OLED display and big notch in the top. The screen is great and hides a good pressure-sensitive in-display fingerprint scanner. The curved sides and narrow width makes the massive screen manageable. The top notch hides the 3D face recognition system that uses the same technology as Apple’s Face ID.

If that wasn’t enough, there’s a brilliant triple-camera system on the back that gives you up to 5x hybrid zoom and all the way down to 0.6x for wide-angle photos, which make instant panoramas. The front-facing selfie camera isn’t bad either.

Performance is top-notch, while battery life is near double the competition. There’s wireless charging in the back, which can even wirelessly charge other devices at the flick of a switch. The 40W cable charger is superfast, too.

Huawei’s EMUI isn’t the best Android experience available, but it’s much improved on older versions. The glass back can even have a vinyl-like texture to it, which makes it less slippery and repels fingerprints.

Verdict: The best phone of the year isn’t cheap, but offers a brilliant, cutting-edge experience that lasts ages between charges.

The oldest phone here, released a month before the rest, Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9 is a different beast.

It’s got a stunning 6.4in OLED screen, a top-of-the-line processor, expandable storage, a great dual camera on the back, wireless charging and even a headphone jack – the only phone here to do so.

But it is the stylus that pops out from a port in the bottom of the phone that sets it apart. It might be tiny, but it’s one of the best you can buy on any device. Draw, sign, annotate, poke, prod and even click the camera shutter with the new remote Bluetooth button option, to your heart’s content. When you’re done, you can just slot it in the bottom and forget about it. The stylus charges in seconds once docked and lasts about 30 minutes of continuous use.

For now, the Note 9 only runs the older Android 8.1 version, not the latest Android 9 Pie like the rest. But the Note 9 is still the do-anything phone, if you can put up with its massive size.

Verdict: For those that need a productivity powerhouse, the Note 9 is it.

Apple’s iPhone XS is arguably the best smaller phone on the market. Its 5.8in OLED screen is brilliant, while the all-screen design is space efficient, meaning it has a big screen squeezed into a small body.

It also has a superfast processor, snappy performance and the excellent Face ID facial recognition system. The home button has been replaced with Apple’s best-in-class gesture system, which takes about 10 minutes to adjust to.

The dual-camera system on the back is great, too, offering some of the best detailed photos, zoom and low-light performance. Apple’s excellent Portrait mode is fun, as are the face-tracking Animoji.

Battery life is only OK, managing to get through most days, but you’ll need to charge it before heading out for a night on the town. Wireless charging in the back makes that easy, but the included cable charger is pretty slow.

It’s also super expensive, but it has a luxurious feel that’s unrivalled in 2018, and it’s heavier than you might expect, so at least it feels like you’re getting £1,000 worth of phone. Most users will stick it in a case because the glass front and back will smash if dropped.

Verdict: Pricey, but the best iPhone available and a brilliant combination of size and capability.

The OnePlus 6T proves you don’t need £900-plus to buy cutting-edge technology.

Building on the excellent OnePlus 6, the 6T has a great in-display fingerprint sensor and a tiny, widow’s-peak-like notch for the selfie camera. For £500 you get top‑of-the-line specs, plenty of storage, dual-sim support and a brilliant screen. You also get a good, but not quite the best, dual-camera system on the back, a good selfie camera on the front and good battery life.

The OnePlus 6T is a brutally fast device with an Android experience that’s second only to Google’s Pixel 3. Gaming performance is solid, too, while there are plenty of customisation options, including a solid set of gestures for navigation that rival Apple’s.

Despite having a glass back, there’s no wireless charging, but the cable charger is really fast. The alert slider switching between silent, vibrate and ring is a nice touch.

Verdict: It may not have the best camera, but you have to spend nearly double to get a better phone than this.

The Pixel 3 is arguably the best Android device with a comparatively small 5.5in screen. But unlike most smaller phones, it isn’t a cheaper, cutdown version of something larger.

You get a top-of-the-line processor, a cracking single-camera system that’s better than most dual cameras and a bright, crisp OLED screen. You also get the best of Google, including Gmail’s autocomplete for blasting through mundane emails, lots of useful local AI tools, and three years of software updates.

The Pixel 3 has an all-glass design, although not exactly all-screen, stereo speakers and even a dual-camera system on the front for shooting wide-angle selfies. Battery is only OK, but the two-tone glass back has wireless charging.

But it is the ultra-refined experience that is the big draw, which offers an Apple-level of polish, raising the bar for Android.

Verdict: The best Android experience you can buy in 2018, but not necessarily the best smartphone.",0.9997,
141,UK news,Met police driving cars into thieves on mopeds in crime crackdown,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/23/met-police-say-tough-tactics-have-reduced-violent-moped,2018-11-23T16:48:15Z,"Police in London say tough tactics used against suspected violent thieves on mopeds, including chasing them and knocking them off their bikes, have helped reduce crime.

The Metropolitan police said there had been a 36% reduction in thefts that involved mopeds or scooters since the tactics were adopted last year.

These include providing officers with a special marking spray to fire at suspects, using remote-controlled spikes to burst the tyres of bikes, and using police cars to knock suspects off their bikes.

Officers had been reluctant to chase mopeds, some driven at high speed by suspects as young as 14, amid fears of injury or death.

But Insp Jim Corbett said those who thought they would not be chased if they took off their helmets were in for a surprise: “A big myth that we have is that if people remove their helmets they think they are not going to be pursued.”

He said officers were told by one person they caught: “I took my helmet off as I thought you would stop chasing me.” That person, who was later jailed, rode on to the pavement. Officers deemed him a danger to the public and used “tactical contact” to knock him off his scooter.

A special team called Scorpion drivers have been trained in tactical contact. Policies were drawn up using legal experts to minimise the chances of officers being prosecuted for using the technique, which was introduced in October 2017. So far this year officers have knocked suspects off their mopeds or scooters 63 times, including those who have taken off their helmets.

One Scorpion driver, Sgt Tony McGovern, said it was one of the hardest tactics to use: “It’s just a slight nudge. It’s controlled.” He said suspects were amazed when in some cases they were sent sprawling off their mopeds. “They are shocked. They say ‘We did not think you were allowed to do that,’ especially when they take off their helmet. They are confused.”

He said other police cars would try to slow the scooter or moped before he and other specialist drivers struck the suspect’s vehicle at “as slow a speed as possible”.

McGovern said Scorpion drivers aimed to minimise injury to those being pursued and civilians. At impact the driver removes her or his foot from the accelerator and uses the brakes to nudge the suspect off the bike, he said. “It’s incredibly quick and very dynamic. Your decision-making changes in a split second.”

Three incidents have been referred to the police watchdog for investigation.

The Met said last year 24% of their pursuits involved officers chasing mopeds or scooters. This year, that figure rose to 40%.

The issue of moped crime has been seen as part of a crimewave that made headlines and added to public unease about the prevalence of violence.

Hailing a fall in crime in which mopeds were used, the Met said from January to October 2017 there were 19,455 offences in London. From January this year to October there were 12,419.

Commander Amanda Pearson said: “The public quite rightly expects us to intervene to keep London safe. Our highly trained police drivers weigh up the risks and decide upon the most appropriate tactics in those circumstances.

“Offenders on mopeds and motorcycles who attempt to evade the police are making a choice that puts themselves and others at risk. A lot of them get up and run away, looking aghast at how dare we.”

Several factors triggered the surge in moped crime from early 2017. One was an increase in moped and scooter ownership, coupled with security measures not being tough enough to stop them being stolen.

Smartphones are lucrative gadgets for thieves, and the Met had previously said Apple iPhones were the target in two-thirds of thefts, followed by Samsung Galaxies. Young people behind the thefts can make up to £200 for each phone they steal.

The crimewave is being driven by a growing illegal market in phone parts, with some young people stealing brands of mobiles to order. There have been signs that some of the offending is highly organised.

Initially Met chiefs believed moped-riding thieves tended to drive by at speed before snatching a phone from a victim’s hand. But an increase in the levels of violence used led police chiefs to develop tougher tactics.",-0.9977,

143,Business,Where to get the best UK Black Friday deals and offers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/13/black-friday-2018-best-uk-deals-offers-guide,2018-11-23T08:34:44Z,"Black Friday, Britain’s biggest shopping event, is nearly upon us, and with many high street retailers struggling, shoppers can expect to bag some good bargains.

It originated in the US, where stores mark the start of the festive shopping season the day after the Thanksgiving public holiday with big price cuts and promotions.

It has become a fortnight-long £10bn shopping extravaganza, while some retailers, including Carphone Warehouse and Halfords, offer Black Friday-themed discounts for all of November.

Amazon fired the starting gun a week early and is billing this year’s wave of promotions as its “biggest-ever Black Friday sale”. It has tens of thousands of “lightning deals” that offer bargains in limited quantities.

Much of the shopping will be done online again, with shoppers preferring to bargain hunt on their phones or laptops, rather than queuing up outside shops in the early hours. However, some offers can only be had in stores, for example, at Morrisons.

Here is the Observer’s handy guide to how to snap up a bargain and stay out of the red.

Upright, cylinder, bagged, bagless, corded or cordless, the choice sometimes seems endless. You can even get robot vacs, so you may never need to actually do the work yourself again. To find out which cleaner is most suited to you, and your budget, here are some of the best of the current crop.

The Dyson Cyclone V10 really is the Don of the cordless stick vacuums. In fact, Dyson is so sure it’s got this right, it has stopped designing any corded vacs for now. At £400, it’s not exactly cheap but it could well render your traditional vacuum cleaner redundant. It’s great at picking up both large and small debris, cleaning carpet and hard flooring as well as pet hair removal. Dyson claims the battery can last an hour and, although this is on a low power setting, even half this time could be enough to clean a medium-sized house. It’s worth noting, if you clean on the “Turbo” setting, be prepared for the battery running out in less than 10 minutes.

The best cordless vacuum cleaner on a budget

If the thought of paying out a few hundred pounds for a cordless vacuum sends shivers down your spine, then there is a comparatively affordable, decent stick vac available. The Vax Blade 32V will happily hoover away for up to 45 minutes (though this time is reduced if you use the boost mode or the motorised floorhead). On carpet, it is worth turning on the floorhead in order to pick up pet hair and to get deeper into the pile. With two separate battery indicators, you’ll have no excuse for running out of power midway through a spring clean.

Let’s face it, no one really likes vacuuming, so a robot vac is incredibly appealing. For day-to-day, light vacuuming, these are very useful indeed. The Samsung PowerBot VR7000 (also know by the slightly less snazzy name of VR2DM706UWS/EU) is one of the best models currently available. It has programmable software so you can set it to get rid of the worst of the dirt while you’re out. It’s best to have the robot vac cleaning every other day though, as the dust container is small and needs to be manually emptied.

The best vacuum cleaner for pet hair

Do you have fur balls clogging up your carpet or afghan hair on your sofa? If so, the Miele C3 Complete Cat & Dog PowerLine is just what you need. There are a multitude of accessories with this vacuum cleaner, making it extremely versatile, but the most useful things for pet owners are the turbo floorhead for large areas of carpet, and the mini turbo-brush for stairs and upholstery. Not only will the filter stop tiny dust particles coming back into the room, but it also traps odours. Ideal!

Shark isn’t the first, second or third name you’d think of when asked to name a vacuum cleaner brand. The manufacturer may be new to the market but it knows what it’s doing because the Shark NV601UK is a great vacuum cleaner. It’s superb at picking up dust and debris, and the only drawback is that it’s heavy. Fortunately, the dust collection cylinder, hose and floorhead can detach from the main body, making it easier to hoover areas like the stairs. There’s also the Shark NV601UKT version, which is designed to help pet owners clean up pet hair/fur.

At £750, the Vorwerk Kobold VK200 certainly isn’t cheap, but it’s probably everything you’ll ever need from a vacuum cleaner. The floorhead will automatically adjust itself when moving from hard floors to carpet, giving it excellent dirt, debris and hair pickup and with 99% of allergens captured. A whole range of accessories are available, including dry detergent to sprinkle into carpets before vacuuming, and a head that both mops and dries the floor. You won’t find it on the high street as it needs to be bought directly from the manufacturer, but don’t let this put you off.

145,Opinion,Heavy curtains fell on me and my desk was sawn in half: my Ubud writing holiday hell | Brigid Delaney's diary,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/09/inspired-by-geoff-dyer-i-came-to-boring-ubud-to-write-the-universe-had-other-plans,2018-11-08T17:00:20Z,"In Out of Sheer Rage, English writer Geoff Dyer set out to pen a biography of DH Lawrence and instead his process was derailed by procrastination and dissatisfaction. The book is a near perfect depiction of trying and failing to write a biography (although the book that Dyer did end up writing is brilliant, better than any straight-up Lawrence study that he should have been writing).

Last week, I semi-isolated myself in order to start working on a novel, a form I hadn’t attempted for a few years. My last novel took eight years to write and rewrite – and made me a very small, almost token, sum of money.

Did I really want to go through that again?

No! Yet there I was. I had a story in my head that wouldn’t leave me alone. And its imagined structure and tone were part inspired by Dyer – not his Lawrence book, but his more recent novel Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi.

I would write in a room in a hotel in Ubud, Bali, that looked idyllic in the pictures. The location was also inspired by Dyer. In his book of essays, Yoga for People who Can’t Be Bothered to Do It, Dyer described a stint in Ubud that is defined primarily by boredom.

He writes: “Oh Ubud, lovely, boring Ubud! It was so lovely, but we were there too long, far too long, and became somewhat demoralised by all the time we had on our hands.”

My idea was to go to a place so dull, so oozing in time, that there would be nothing else to do but write a book.

During my visit, the Ubud writers festival was on. The plan was to write 2,000 words each morning, then in the afternoons attend sessions at the festival to get inspired by other writers.

But when I checked into the hotel, the “writing desk” – the epicentre of my endeavour – was sawn in half. The pictures on the hotel’s website indicated a vast expanse of desk with enough room for notebooks and a laptop, at least four mugs of congealing coffee and a packet of chips.

But the desk – if you could call it that – was strangely narrow, about as wide as a Samsung Galaxy phone and useless for writing unless I wanted to work with my laptop dangling off the edge. I tried it briefly but the pressure of my wrists on the keyboard kept flipping the computer over.

The desk was not the only impediment.

At night the balcony light shone into my room. On the first night after spending 20 minutes running my hand across every surface, I still couldn’t find the switch.

It was useless ringing reception. When I checked in they told me all the room phones were broken. All of them.

When I tried to close the heavy drapes to block out the light, the drapes fell on me. The curtains, which weighed about 20 kilograms, half hung off the railing, with the rest pooling on the ground. Gravity threatened to tear the runner and associated attachments from the wall.

I wondered, do I dare climb on a chair and attempt to reattach the drapes (or as they say in Ubud: Do I Dare Disturb the Universe?)

As I went to try and sleep, shoulder bruised from being struck by heavy curtains, a scarf over my eyes to block out the brightness, the half desk shining in the perpetual balcony light, I wondered if these were far from ideal conditions in which to write a novel. The bad room was a sign – perhaps I should abandon my book. After all, that is what Dyer would have done.

The following night, I found out that the balcony lights were controlled from a switch near the lobby. “Where’s the switch?” I asked the concierge.

“They are in a central switchboard at the back of the hotel.”

“Can you show me where it is?”

“No, it is not an area for guests.”

“But how do I turn off the lights?”

“Call us and we’ll turn off the lights.”

“Come up to reception and tell us when you are ready to go to sleep and we will turn off your lights. You can also close the curtains to block out the light.”

“But the curtains are broken. They FELL on me. ”

I left the hotel, day five now without having written a word, and went to see a session at the writers festival. Somewhat appropriately, it was Dyer in conversation with Michael Williams.

After the session, I went to an Indian restaurant for lunch. Dyer was there sitting at a table by himself, eating what looked like a dosa. In a different universe (perhaps the disturbed universe where I stand on the chair and try and repair the curtains) I would approach Dyer and tell him that his story about the boredom of Ubud was the very thing that brought me here to write, and that the novel I was going to write was a triptych, its structure inspired in part on the diptych structure of his novel Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi.

But then I would tell him that in a strange twist, it was his Out of Sheer Rage that was the true template for my current experience: the half a desk, the broken drapes (still not fixed!), and the maddening distraction of the balcony light, burning perpetually like a tabernacle flame.

Previously, I’d had a conversation with some friends about what I might say should I see Dyer in an informal setting around Ubud.

“Nothing,” said one. “You say nothing to him. You DON’T LOOK AT HIM, OK?! You certainly don’t tell him that he is inspiring your current work.”

“And you certainly don’t tell the plot of your current work,” said another.

“That I haven’t written yet,” I said, with nonetheless a question in my voice. “I don’t tell him about the thing he inspired that I haven’t written yet?”

I had seen it before in signing queues (never my own) – the excited reader approaching their writer/muse, sometimes with a book to sign. A messy word vomit spills out. It’s horrible. The writer is trapped, seated, supplicant behind their signing desk, while the fan – standing, in a strange reversal of power – looms from above, gibbering. Telling a writer about a book you haven’t yet written, is like telling them about a half-remembered dream. They may listen out of politeness, but it is not a conversation that they can fully or even partially enter because the thing itself is not real. It’s not even real to the dreamer.

I looked at Geoff Dyer happy, alone, eating a dosa, unburdened by the knowledge of how he had inspired the book I was yet to write, my literal journey here to boring Ubud, and my current distress with my hotel room, which was in turn blocking my writing of the book – and turned and walked away.",-0.9514,
146,US news,Thursday US briefing: Sessions exit raises fears for Mueller inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/08/thursday-us-briefing-sessions-exit-raises-fears-for-mueller-inquiry,2018-11-08T11:33:02Z,"Good morning, I’m Tim Walker with today’s headlines. If you’d like to receive this briefing by email, sign up here.

Senior Republicans have added their voices to the widespread warnings that Robert Mueller must be left to complete his Russia investigation, after Donald Trump finally fired his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, on Wednesday, raising fears that Trump’s ultimate target is Mueller himself.

Sessions was among the most committed enablers of the Trump political project, but his perceived personal disloyalty to the president ultimately made his position untenable. And with Sessions gone, oversight of the Trump-Russia inquiry will fall to his acting replacement, Matt Whitaker, a longtime Mueller critic.
• None ‘Vast scam’. Whitaker sat on the advisory board of World Patent Marketing, which was recently ordered to pay a $26m settlement after being accused of running a multimillion-dollar scam to dupe aspiring inventors.
• None Free press. The CNN reporter Jim Acosta had his White House press credentials revoked after his attempts to ask Trump about the Russia inquiry led to a fiery exchange at a press conference. The White House claimed he had “placed his hands” on an intern trying to take the microphone from him, something Acosta denied and video of the incident did not show.

Where next for Democrats after midterm gains?

With House Democrats at last wielding the legal firepower to investigate the Trump administration, the question is where, exactly, to begin: the tax returns, the alleged corruption, Russia? Whatever their line of attack, Trump has promised a “warlike” response.

Pundits are still reading the tea leaves left behind after the midterms: it was a good election for Democrats, but not one that produced an obvious presidential frontrunner for 2020. Speaking to the Guardian, Bernie Sanders said the results proved a progressive can win the White House.
• None Southern strategy. After disappointment for Democrats in Georgia and Florida, the party is hoping that final tallies in Georgia’s gubernatorial race and the possibility of a recount for Florida’s Senate seat might see them pluck victory from the jaws of defeat.

Twelve people were shot and killed in a mass shooting at a country and western bar in southern California. A gunman threw smoke bombs and fired at least 30 shots in the incident at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, around 40 miles west of Los Angeles, late on Wednesday night.
• None Young people. Police said a sheriff’s sergeant was among those killed in the shooting, which reportedly took place during a college country music night attended by dozens of young people. The gunman is also dead.
• None Donald Trump has said he expects to meet Kim Jong-Un again early next year, after senior North Korean officials cancelled this week’s planned talks with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo.
• None A medical school in Tokyo has offered places to dozens of women after admitting it had deliberately marked down their exam scores to limit the number of female students.
• None Jason Blum, the prolific horror producer behind such films as Get Out and Halloween, was booed off stage at the Israeli film festival in Beverly Hills after criticising Donald Trump in an acceptance speech.
• None Samsung has unveiled its much-anticipated new foldable smartphone as the company attempts to regain ground in its longstanding rivalry with Apple.

Listen to Today in Focus: Can you take on the EU and win?

On today’s podcast, the Guardian’s political correspondent Lauren Gambino reflects on the midterms. Plus: the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis fought to strike a deal with the EU, and failed. He tells Anushka Asthana his experience holds lessons for the UK prime minister, Theresa May, as she enters the Brexit endgame.

In 1910, four Alaskan gold prospectors scaled the highest peak in North America in a single day, sustained by doughnuts and hot chocolate, without ropes and hefting a fourteen-foot flagpole. Or did they? Jon Waterman investigates.

No accident: the making of an opioid epidemic

America’s opioid crisis has been called “one of the biggest mistakes in modern medicine”, started by profiteering pharmaceutical companies and well-meaning doctors. Chris McGreal talks to the people who saw it coming, and tried to stop it.

Residents of Manizales in central Colombia live with the daily risk of natural disaster: frequent major earthquakes, a tendency to torrential rain and mudslides – not to mention the volcano next door. But its innovative approach to prevention and response has made the city a global leader, as Mat Youkee reports.

The books that reveal how Russia influences the world

With Russian election meddling back under the spotlight on both sides of the Atlantic, the Guardian’s former Moscow correspondent Luke Harding selects the best books to help understand how the Kremlin exerts its influence on the west.

The Blue Wave that brought the Democrats back to power in the House ought to have been a tsunami, writes Heather Cox Richardson. But despite a popular vote margin of more than 7%, the rigged system means Republicans still wield unwarranted power.

Cristiano Ronaldo may have put in a classic Champions League performance for Juventus on Wednesday evening, but it was Manchester United who triumphed at last after two late goals, much to their embattled manager’s satisfaction.

147,Global development,Samsung should try imagining a world where big firms respect workers,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/08/samsung-should-try-imagining-a-world-where-big-firms-respect-workers,2018-11-08T07:00:06Z,"Think of your favourite gadgets and appliances, and it’s likely some of them started life in a rundown, mosquito-infested dormitory complex an hour’s drive from Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur.

In each block there is a makeshift kitchen, a small, grubby toilet and three rooms crowded with bunk beds. There is no air conditioning to break the oppressively humid air. Outside, burning rubbish sends acrid fumes through the labour camp, which is strewn with broken furniture and an abandoned vehicle.

To call it a slum would be generous. I’ve seen some truly appalling workers’ camps in Malaysia and the Gulf, but this rivalled the worst.

Every day, the men who live here work on factory lines making components used by Samsung Electronics, one of the biggest electronics companies in the world. Last year, Samsung made a profit of almost $50bn (£38bn).

In Malaysia that money is made largely by the hands of cheap foreign migrant labour – millions of workers drawn from the region’s poorest countries.

Malaysia, where forced labour – a form of modern slavery – is commonplace, has a reputation for the flagrant abuse of workers rights.

But that hasn’t stopped Samsung, and dozens of other leading electronics companies, from setting up shop here.

Unlike its competitors, most of Samsung’s products are assembled in-house, but it uses a long chain of suppliers to provide it with parts, services and labour, including foreign migrant workers.

I walked around the camp, stunned. Why must men who are part of the supply chain of one of the world’s biggest electronics companies live in such squalor and be treated so poorly?

What was so frustrating was that I’d seen it all before. Two years ago, I travelled to Malaysia to investigate the treatment of these foreign migrants working at Samsung.

Men employed by a sub-contractor, but working on the assembly line of Samsung’s microwave oven plant, told me that their passports had been confiscated, that they were being paid less than promised, and that they were deep in debt after shelling out high fees to recruitment agents in their home country.

Despite working at seemingly normal factories, these men were effectively trapped in their jobs by debt bondage and felt unable to leave even though they knew they were being exploited.

Samsung’s response was quick. They fired the sub-contractor and announced improved guidelines for the recruitment and treatment of foreign migrant workers. The guidelines, which apply to Samsung worksites and its suppliers, state migrant workers should pay no recruitment fees, receive the minimum wage and retain their passports.

Samsung said: “We will be strictly applying and implementing these guidelines across our global operations as well as among our suppliers.”

In September, I returned to see if they had lived up to their promises.

At first, there were some positive signs. Workers at the microwave plant told me the factory was safe, the food was good and they liked the games room in their hostel. Some said they were only being paid a basic salary of about a pound an hour, but they seemed satisfied. Most importantly, those recruited directly by Samsung since 2016 said they had not paid any recruitment fees.

Although it was encouraging to see that changes had been made at this one plant, I wanted to see if the same applied for workers further down the supply chain. Samsung certainly appeared to have made sure that conditions for the men it directly employed and were legally responsible for had improved, but what about the many others also working at this factory, who were instead hired through sub-contracting companies? According to its own guidelines, and international labour standards, Samsung is responsible for their welfare too.

So I went back to the factory and followed a group of men heading home on foot at the end of their shift. Dozens of pairs of shoes crowded the entrance to a couple of flats in a rundown apartment block, within sight of the Samsung plant.

The flats were home to 21 men from Bangladesh. All had been hired by a company that supplied workers, through another company, to Samsung.

They told a very different story. They said they paid vast sums to come to Malaysia, some as high as £3,500 – more than three times the annual per capita income in Bangladesh – but were earning less than promised.

Aminul (not his real name) said it would take him about two years just to pay back the loan he took to afford the recruitment fee. “It’s a huge pressure for me to pay back the debt … When I got here, I realised I made a mistake.”

But like all the men, Aminul says he cannot leave.

“My employer has my passport, so if I want to go back home, I can’t,” he said.

Another group of men, working as cleaners at the same Samsung plant, claimed the company that directly employs them was illegally deducting almost a fifth of their basic salary each month, meaning they were earning far below the minimum wage.

Even at Samsung’s flagship plant in Malaysia, which produces batteries for its bestselling mobile phones, Samsung continues to use sub-contracted workers who have paid high recruitment fees. “They didn’t ask us how much we paid to come here … so there’s no question of us being repaid,” one worker told me.

What was striking was how afraid everyone appeared. They worried that if they spoke to me they would be deported or punished. One worker, referring to his direct employer, told me: “If they know I gave you an interview, they will take me to some place and beat me up.”

When I put my findings to Samsung, they responded with a statement: “We will conduct thorough investigation on this matter that you have shared with us. As a committed member of the global community, Samsung will continue our efforts to both respect and protect human rights of the migrant workers.”

While an investigation is of course welcomed, Samsung could have easily found this out for themselves if they’d really wanted to.

I had a small budget, a couple of assistants and no official access and yet, within a few days, I had uncovered a raft of abuses that strongly suggest forced labour continues among workers employed by some companies supplying labour, parts or services to Samsung.

What I found on my brief journey down this tiny part of Samsung’s electronics supply chain in Malaysia remains an everyday reality for the millions of migrant workers across the world who toil daily to make the gadgets we use to make our own lives easier and more enjoyable.

This is what is looks like when companies are left to police their own supply chains; when mega-companies chase profit, with insufficient concern for a workforce that case has no means of comeback.

What I found in that labour camp is not an inevitability. It is a choice that companies are making. And we all have to bear some responsibility when we look the other way.

Samsung used to have a brand campaign with the slogan: “With Samsung, it’s not that hard to imagine.”

What I’d like to do is ask Samsung and all the companies around the world who rely on the sweat and toil of a migrant workforce to imagine that everyone in their supply chain is their responsibility. Imagine recruiting them directly, not through agents, and at zero cost. Imagine auditing your whole supply chain regularly and rigorously. Imagine paying everyone a decent wage. And then make it a reality.",0.9365,
148,World news,"Thursday briefing: Sessions sacked, Acosta banned as Trump lashes out",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/08/thursday-briefing-sessions-sacked-acosta-banned-as-trump-lashes-out,2018-11-08T06:17:46Z,"Good morning briefers. I’m Martin Farrer and thanks for joining me for a run through of the top stories today.

In a night of high drama in Washington, Donald Trump has rid himself of two troublesome figures by sacking his attorney general Jeff Sessions and then revoking the press pass of CNN reporter Jim Acosta after an angry exchange at a press conference.

Sessions was the first to go. He had infuriated the US president last year by recusing himself from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling and, with the dust still settling from Tuesday’s midterm elections, the senator was told he had to go. His departure – and interim replacement by his deputy, the controversial arch-Mueller critic Matthew Whitaker – brought immediate calls from Republicans that the investigation should be allowed to continue. Democrats also cried foul. Tom McCarthy has this analysis of what it all means for the Mueller probe. And if you’re counting, Sessions is the 41st high-profile appointees who have been fired or resigned since Trump took office.

The buildup to Sessions’s sacking was a chaotic press conference at which Trump clashed angrily with Acosta when the CNN reporter challenged the president’s scare-mongering about immigration. Trump tried to brush him off at which point a White House staffer tried to take the microphone off Acosta, but he held on. Some hours later the administration media relations reached a new nadir as Acosta’s credentials were withdrawn on the basis that he had “placed his hands” on an intern. CNN responded that the accusation was false and said it stood by the reporter. You can watch the clash here. You can also read how Trump raged at possible Democrat attempts to use their newly gained control of the House to investigate him.

Elsewhere in America, the ramification of the midterms are being felt, such as in once rock-solid Republican Orange county, California which appears to be turning for the Democrats. Despite that, the party is left hoping for miracles in tight races in Florida and Georgia and has emerged from the elections still lacking an obvious presidential candidate for 2020. But perhaps the most bizarre question of all is what happens now that a dead pimp has won a Senate seat for Nevada?

Ill-advised – Drama was also promised in the latest crunch cabinet meeting on Brexit. But that meeting will not now go ahead as expected today or tomorrow amid a wrangle about senior ministers’ access to legal advice on the Irish border backstop issue. A summary of the sensitive advice, which is seen as crucial to determining the government’s strategy in the final negotiations with Brussels, was given to cabinet by attorney general Geoffrey Cox on Tuesday. But calls are now growing from all sides for it to be published in full. The cabinet will now most likely meet at the weekend or early next week, enabling time for ministers to digest Jeremy Hunt’s planned Armisitice day speech saying that Anglo-French relations will not be destroyed by Brexit.

Uneasy lies the crown – In case you were worried about Prince Charles meddling in national affairs if he ever becomes king, the man himself has told the BBC that he wouldn’t be “that stupid”. Giving an interview to mark his 70th birthday today, the monarch-in-waiting cites Shakespeare’s Prince Hal as an example of how donning the crown can make all the difference to one’s behaviour. “I do realise that it is a separate exercise being sovereign,” he says, perhaps reassuring those concerned that he would lobby about his radical, unkingly hobbyhorses such as the danger of GM crops and climate change. Meanwhile, the prince has been trying his skills in pidgin English during a visit to Nigeria, telling an audience in Lagos: “‘God don butta my bread’ (God has blessed me).”

Housing gloom – The property market is at its weakest for six years, according to a new survey, with house prices falling in London, the south-east, south-west and East Anglia. The monthly snapshot by the surveyors’ body Rics says the market had its worst reading since 2012 and that the lingering uncertainty around Brexit had “massively affected buyer confidence”. Rics said the price falls would continue for another three months, but it wasn’t all gloom for homeowners. Some markets – notably Northern Ireland, Scotland and Northumberland – reported brisk sales.

Bibi freed – The Pakistani Christian woman whose blasphemy case has triggered violent protests and assassinations has been freed from jail. Asia Bibi left a detention facility in Punjab yesterday and was flown to Islamabad, where she was at a secure location because of threats to her life. Some reports said she had already left Pakistan. Canada, France and Spain have reportedly considered offering asylum to Bibi and her family. Her husband has appealed to the UK and the US to offer a safe haven.

Doctored figures – A medical school in Japan has offered places to dozens of women who were unfairly rejected in favour of male candidates. Tokyo Medical University caused an international furore when it admitted that some women’s exam scores were deliberately marked down to restrict the number of female students. Yukiko Hayashi, who became the school’s first female president in September, apologised and said 67 women who had been unfairly excluded over the past two years would be able to take up their places next April.

Today in Focus podcast: Can you take on the EU and win?

Some sobering thoughts for Theresa May and Brexiters in today’s podcast from the former Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, who staked his career on getting a deal with the European Union – and lost. As the PM enters the endgame with Brussels, Varoufakis looks back at the tactics used against Greece and which Britain’s negotiators could learn from. Plus: US political correspondent Lauren Gambino reacts to the midterm results.

Historic England has released a list of properties that are under threat from development or neglect that reads like a collection of the country’s forgotten heritage gems. The list includes the neo-gothic church in Salford where the suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst married in 1879, Grimsby’s Kasbah area (I know – me neither), and the centuries-old Coventry church that counted George Eliot as a worshipper and survived the wartime blitz. It also lists the Wisbech & Fenland Museum, which is described as “an almost perfect example of a Victorian museum”.

José Mourinho defended his reaction at the end of Manchester United’s breathtaking late comeback against Juventus, a victory that saw the United manager ushered from the pitch at the final whistle after cupping his ear provocatively towards the home crowd. Back in Manchester, City moved to the verge of qualification for the Champions League knockout stage with a 6-0 thumping of Shakhtar Donetsk, but the night will be remembered for a Norman Wisdom-style pratfall by Raheem Sterling rather than the football produced. Floyd Mayweather appears to have backed out of a planned New Year’s Eve fight with Japanese kickboxing star Tenshin Nasukawa, claiming he was “blindsided” by the promoter regarding the nature and magnitude of the event. England have told Maro Itoje to get in the faces of the All Blacks on Saturday despite concerns over his discipline. Tommy Makinson has become only the fifth Englishman to receive rugby league’s highest individual accolade, the Golden Boot award. And Ladbrokes could be forced to pay out on hundreds of bets which were turned down by its trading team if the Independent Betting Arbitration Service finds against the firm in three near-identical disputes over bets which are currently being considered by its adjudicators.

Samsung is losing market share to Apple and is pinning its hopes of catching its American rival with a foldable phone that offers a tablet-sized screen with a pocket-sized device. Unveiled in San Francisco last night, the company said it would be ready for mass production in the coming months.

Asia Pacific markets have followed Wall Street’s upbeat mood today in the wake of the midterms. The FTSE100 is seen opening up strongly by 0.6%, while the pound is at $1.312 and €1.148.

The US midterms feature on the front pages of several papers, including the Guardian “Trump issues threat of warlike response after Democrat gains”, the Times “Trump points to second term”, and the FT “Trump urges bipartisan approach as Democrats take control of House”.

The Telegraph leads with the Prince Charles interview, headlining: “I won’t be a meddling king ... I am not that stupid”, as does the Express: “‘I’m not that stupid’”.

The Mirror has story of 98-year-old veteran who is in hospital after being beaten during a robbery “What have we become?”, while the Sun reports on a 50-year-old woman giving birth to four babies: “Quads gift”.

149,Art and design,Thomas Heatherwick’s Coal Drops Yard – shopping in the Instagram age,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/nov/03/thomas-heatherwicks-coal-drops-yard-shopping-in-the-instagram-age,2018-11-03T16:00:06Z,"I am reading the most pretentious and verbose label ever attached to tea towel. If it were a caption next to a work of contemporary art, you would think it excessive. The towel, to give you a condensed version, “twists the traditional expression of a kitchen textile”; with “a vibrant mélange look”, achieved by doing interesting things to yarns and twill stripes, it “adds a contemporary edge to the kitchen”. The tea towel costs £15. Fifteen pounds! Enough to say that it’s a very nice towel, if not one worth the price nor the word count on the label, and that it epitomises a certain sort of contemporary retail that is writ large in the shopping development around it, Coal Drops Yard in King’s Cross, London.

That is to say, it is a thing of use and craft repackaged by design and marketing so as to soak up some of the surplus value sloshing around the credit-card accounts of the modern well-healed urbanite. It touches a desire for the artisanal, a nostalgia for the authentic and the workaday, for those very things that are squeezed out of city life by the self-same economic forces that enable a high-end, 9,290 sq metre, £100m shopping complex such as Coal Drops Yard to come into being in what was formerly an industrial, and then an ex-industrial, badland.

And so it is with Coal Drops Yard as a whole, which is formed out of the two long Victorian sheds through which south Yorkshire coal was once transferred, at a rate of 8m tonnes a year, to horse-drawn carts and thence taken to heat the homes and businesses of London. Which facility, dealt fatal blows by competition from other sources of power, fell into decay. One part was gutted by fire. Another was colonised by Bagley’s nightclub, which until it closed in 2007 held raves 2,500-strong. They formed part of a wider zone of dereliction branded by its prostitution and drug-dealing, even as respectable light industrial businesses continued to ply their trade.

This zone is now a fading memory, having been made into its near-opposite by the developers Argent – clean, prosperous, safe and managed, where before it was dirty, rundown, risky and anarchic. Service industries replace industrial industries. Yet it keeps mementoes of its former state, such as gas holders, storage buildings and canal and railway structures, partly because their retention is required by policies about historic buildings, but also because they add to the attraction of the place.

Coal Drops Yard, where established brands such as Aesop and Paul Smith are combined with a careful selection of newcomers, is a culminating point in the almost-complete transformation of King’s Cross. It is part of the development’s coming-out as a frankly posh place, having previously taken care to dress down, to take both symbolic and material steps to make itself part of the everyday London demotic. It is a place where, at the exceptional tapas joint Barrafina, you can experience the most exquisite pureed beetroot of your life, at a high price.

The yard lets itself go architecturally: having previously favoured some of Britain’s more meticulous and measured architects, Argent has now enlisted the help of the design Aladdin Thomas Heatherwick. With a rub of his magic lamp, he has caused the slate roofs of the two long sheds to soar from their supporting brickwork and meet above a central void in an airborne kiss. With the same rub he has made a hefty chunk of additional retail space, enough to contain a Samsung “creative and digital playground”, in a location where the official guardians of historic buildings would normally look askance at such a thing.

Heatherwick’s superstructure grabs attention, which is what shopping centres tend to do, and he does it with more chutzpah than most. It first gives an instant and Instagrammable visual hit; later it delivers a view over surrounding rooftops which Samsung’s patrons will enjoy when its store opens early next year. Heatherwick’s team have created some meaty and pleasing details in the historic structures underneath and nicely inserted staircases and walkways into the old shells, with unglazed arches conveying an aura of ruins. But the sheds are overwhelmed by acting as launchpads for the main architectural event. The underworld formed beneath the flying Samsung playground feels a tad glum.

Vogue has called the shopping centre “progressive”, which is a striking adaptation to retail of a word more often linked to political idealism. Heatherwick told the Daily Telegraph of the project’s social value: “With the decline in other public gathering points,” he said, “church, for example, or public libraries and community centres which aren’t being financed now – we need places to come to for human interaction.” Time to give up on civic life, he seems to be saying, let’s go shopping.

Language like this rinses substantial concepts of their meaning, the better to use them as marketing. A library, a shop – what’s the difference? It seems to confirm what critics of the King’s Cross development argue, that it is really about expanding the wealthy core of London into an area that was previously mixed, and that its values are ultimately those of retail and property. For Michael Edwards, a planning expert at University College London and a King’s Cross campaigner since the 1980s, “there’s very little there for people on low income or needing public services”. It’s part, he says, of a London-wide process whereby “big capital squeezes out anything noisy, anything scruffy, anything that can’t pay higher rents”.

The rhetoric of Coal Drops Yard certainly raises some questions about both the successes and limits of the model that King’s Cross exemplifies, where developers, with the help of some nudges from public bodies and local groups, are the primary makers of cities. Developers become de facto mayors and planners, directing the provision of public good. They decide everything from the design of public and private buildings to the management and policing of open spaces. How far can the skill sets of benign administration and financial speculation be combined in one organisation? And, no matter how enlightened and intelligent a developer might be, what is to stop the profit motive finally taking over?

Any assessment of the King’s Cross development has to acknowledge that it is the best of its kind, this being the transformation of a large area of a major British city by a single developer. Comparisons might be made with Birmingham’s Bullring and Liverpool One, which are both dominated by retail, or by the office-led Canary Wharf and Broadgate developments in London. The King’s Cross idea has always been to create what the development’s director Robert Evans calls “a part of London, a layered, complex, eclectic piece of the city,” which means it has several different uses.

Detractors might ask, in the manner of Life of Brian: what has Argent ever done for us? Nothing, would be the answer, except for the mixture of businesses, homes and education, the many jobs, the primary school, the pleasant and accessible open spaces, the lawns and fountains, the restored historic buildings, a proposed theatre, and a 40% ratio of affordable housing.

Across the whole 27-hectare (67-acre) King’s Cross site you can see the judicious detailing arising from the judicious choice of leading and emerging architects that this year won Argent the accolade of client of the year from the Royal Institute of British Architects. In the centre is the Central St Martins arts college, housed since 2011 in a conversion of Lewis Cubitt’s impressive 1852 granary building. This is a win-win for both Argent and the academic institution, whereby the latter got a handsome new home and the former found its property animated, which was particularly important in its fragile early years, by thousands of creative and stylish art students.

At the heart of it all is Granary Square, a paved area in front of the granary building. In warm weather children play in the vertical jets of water that rise from the ground. People lounge on steps descending to the Regent’s Canal or gather to watch major sporting events on a big screen. Off to the side you can browse a bookshop in a moored narrowboat, from which wafts the sounds of jazz trumpet. Off to another is the Camley Street Natural Park, an achievement of 1980s community activism, once threatened with destruction, now preserved and flourishing.

Art students float through, dressed in their takes on the bohemianism of the past 100 years: oh look, there’s David Bowie, or Samuel Beckett, or Siouxsie Sioux, or Gertrude Stein, or Yoko Ono, or Kerouac, or Warhol. Anyone is welcome, as long as they obey the rules lightly enforced by friendly red-hatted security personnel – families from nearby council estates, executives at the advertising and tech companies now locating here, journalists (full disclosure) from the offices of the Observer and the Guardian, which are just off the Argent estate.

All this is made possible by a rare degree of long-term thinking in turn made possible by special circumstances. One is that the main backers are pension funds, which by their nature take a long view of investments. Another was a seven-year period before construction could start, as the high-speed line to the Channel tunnel was being built across the site, which gave time for considered planning and consultation.

Also significant was the fact that there had been less sensitive proposals for the site, in the early 90s, which had prompted the formation of strong-minded local opposition groups. This episode had made the borough of Camden, in whose territory most of the King’s Cross site falls (the rest is in Islington) sceptical about property companies. Locals and politicians created pressure that developers couldn’t ignore. Then, in the early years of this century, it required thoughtfulness, patience and diplomacy on all sides to come up with the plan that is now being realised.

Two individuals in particular made it happen – Camden’s then director for the environment Peter Bishop, recently described to me as a “saint” by one who has seen him in action, and Argent’s then chief executive Roger Madelin, who went to meeting after meeting with the area’s very many interested parties. Madelin also used to show diagrams of the many constraints governing the site: mainline trains, underground trains, the canal, listed buildings, a corridor protecting the view of St Paul’s Cathedral from Hampstead Heath, which limits the height of buildings.

Given so many pressures and constraints, a certain defensiveness was to be expected. Madelin was never going to give himself an additional degree of difficulty by commissioning an architecturally radical scheme. In any case this was the spirit of the age – thanks partly to the intervention of Prince Charles, during the 1980s, in the proposed redevelopment of Paternoster Square, next to St Paul’s, singular monoliths were out. Constructed variety, in which different architects give different wrappings to fundamentally similar office or apartment blocks, was in.

Argent hired the classicising architect Demetri Porphyrios and the tactful practice of Allies and Morrison to produce a masterplan of traditional urban forms – city blocks arranged around squares and streets, whose formality is then offset by the asymmetries and incidents of the site. An agreeable fiction is created, that these blocks were not all created by a single entity at about the same time. A number of styles co-exist: emulations of continental housing blocks in textured brickwork, the diluted classicism of a Porphyrios office building, an aesthetic that Evans calls “industrial luxury”, expressed by the satisfyingly sturdy cast-iron columns of an office block by David Chipperfield, or by the rust-coloured oxidised steel of another by Eric Parry.

So how, then, could anyone complain? How many more goodies will we demand from the developers’ sack of gifts? And why am I possessed by the irrational desire to hire a small submarine and torpedo the blameless jazz-playing floating bookshop? How churlish can you be?

The first and maybe least important quibbles are architectural. Many of the buildings are handsome and few are poor, but eventually the dissembling of power and the avoidance of conflict become oppressive, or enervating, or both. It’s great that Argent have restored the mighty industrial structures, products of more brutal economics than those of the current development, but they are somehow neutered by the tasteful landscaping and cladding that surrounds them. One of the old gasholders is left as an empty frame, for example, a powerful structure that needs no embellishment. But embellished it is, by a fussy installation of mirrors at its base.

There’s awkwardness and rigidity at the edges of the different elements, a lack of give and take that becomes acute where the development’s north-eastern boundaries meet the rest of the world. There’s indeterminacy in the spaces between contrasting structures. Before this was a place of drama, made of shifts of level and clashes of scale. Now it’s smoothed out, tending towards the condition of a high-design tea towel. It’s possible that the forthcoming Google HQ, a 1,000ft long beast by Heatherwick and the Danish-American practice BIG, will do something to counter this tameness. It will have, at the minimum, a certain confidence and consistency.

More generally, unease comes from management and the feeling of being managed, the sense that everything is calculated and little is truly spontaneous. The presence of art and music highlight this feeling, these being activities that live off improvisation and the unpredictable. You know that if anything genuinely challenging happened here it would be escorted off the premises.

Granary Square, along with most of the streets and squares, are examples of what is now called Pops – privately owned public space – since the London borough of Camden has so far declined an option to adopt them, presumably because it doesn’t want to pay the running costs. Argent points out that all such space was previously shut off from public use, sometimes with brick walls, so it has taken nothing away from the public realm. Rather, it has added something new, but it’s still the case that its Pops doesn’t feel like an actual piece of city. Among the signs is that the homeless, if they are there at all, keep a very low profile. They certainly don’t ask you for money.

Everyone who enjoys Granary Square is in effect a guest of Argent, which means that subtle shifts in management could make them less welcome in the future which, if Coal Drops Yard is the future, would be bad news for people who don’t want to buy fancy tea towels and Aesop soap. At present it is part of the mix, a spot of West End luxury to go with everything else. Anyone can go there, if they like, to gawp at the Heatherwick kiss or watch their fellow citizens, but there’s not much to make them linger if they don’t want to shop. If the Coal Drops ethos becomes that of the whole estate, and the coming of Google is likely to push it that way, then Argent’s ambitions to make it an everyday bit of London will fail.

On the scale of iniquities and crudeness of which property development is capable, any chinks in Argent’s virtue are minor stuff. It’s also hard to know what Argent could do to counter the feeling that it’s a bit too neat and tidy – hire dirt consultants? Permit licensed beggars? Curate prostitution? I’d say it could push its architecture harder and generally lighten up a bit. Otherwise King’s Cross is what it is, namely the work of a single estate, which is a London tradition: it’s how areas such as Bloomsbury and Belgravia got built. The upside is that the job actually gets done, and that places like Granary Square can be created. The downside is the over-managed feel.

In a better world King’s Cross would set a standard from which to improve. It’s possible that Madelin, who is now working on the redevelopment of Canada Water in south London, will achieve just that. But in other parts of the capital, in Vauxhall Cross and around the Old Kent Road, current and planned development is unlikely to reach the levels of consideration and public benefit achieved by the collaboration of Camden and Argent, not least because local authorities have been significantly weakened. One day this might change. Meanwhile it’s useful to see King’s Cross for what it is: an impressive achievement, but a not a normal piece of city.",0.9996,
150,Technology,OnePlus 6T review: you'd have to spend double to get better than this,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/02/oneplus-6t-review-in-display-fingerprint-scanner-speedy-performance-all-screen-design-notch,2018-11-02T06:00:23Z,"With in-display fingerprint scanner and speedy performance, this is the smartphone that brings all-screen design up a notch

The OnePlus 6T proves that cutting-edge technology doesn’t have to cost the Earth, bringing an in-display fingerprint scanner and a tiny notch for just £500.

OnePlus has kept things simple for years, offering top specifications for budget prices. The price has slowly crept up to not-quite-so budget, but the level of refinement and technology has also improved.

The OnePlus 6T builds on the already excellent OnePlus 6, by further cutting away anything that isn’t screen. The gorgeous, crisp and colourful OLED display is a smidgen bigger at 6.41in, with a smaller chin at the bottom and a tiny teardrop-shaped notch at the top.

It’s an impressive design and proves that notches for the selfie camera don’t have to be that intrusive. It looks a little like a widow’s peak but is rapidly forgotten about, and you can even hide it in a black bar if you hate notches. The earpiece speaker is embedded in the rim at the very top of the phone above the camera and works fine when you’re on the phone.

Centrally located about 2cm up from the bottom of the screen is a hidden in-display fingerprint scanner that lights up in wild electric green colour when active. That leaves the frosted or polished glass back free of intrusions apart from the camera and LED flash.

The smooth, curved glass back feels nice in the hand and isn’t as slippery as some, but it will slide off furnishings if you’re not careful. The glass meets the metal sides with a little lip on both the front and the back of the device, which doesn’t feel quite as well finished as its predecessor.

At 74.8mm wide, 8.2mm thick and 185g in weight, the OnePlus 6T is ever so slightly narrower, thicker and heavier than its predecessor, but is narrower and 23g lighter than the iPhone XS Max and around the same dimensions all round as Google’s Pixel 3 XL.

The bottom of the phone has symmetrical speaker grilles, one of which is for show, and the USB-C port, making the 6T the first from OnePlus without a headphone socket.

Overall it’s a sleek design that’s so understated it’s almost a little plain in the frosted midnight black colour.

The OnePlus 6T has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, 6 or 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of storage as the OnePlus 6 launched in May, and as such performs exactly the same in general usage.

The OnePlus 6T flies along, matching or exceeding rivals for raw speed of launching apps, switching between apps and launching the camera. Gaming performance is also top notch using OnePlus’s new gaming mode and smart boost systems speeding up game loading. Frame-rates were super smooth even over an hour or so playing Shadowgun Legends.

Battery life is solid but not exceptional. With relatively heavy use it would last 30 hours between charges, lasting from a 7am morning alarm on day one and stretching till gone 12-noon on day two.

That was while using it as my primary device, sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, 30 minutes of gaming and shooting about 15 photos.

The OnePlus 6T charges pretty quickly via the fast charger that comes with it, reaching a full charge in around 90 minutes – but it doesn’t have wireless charging.

OxygenOS is OnePlus’s customised version of Android, this time based on the latest Android 9 Pie.

As with previous versions, OxygenOS 9 is a slightly refined version of the standard Android experience, made to be as responsive as possible while adding some much-needed customisations.

For instance, you have a choice of standard home, back and overview navigation buttons, Google’s new gesture button or OnePlus’s swipe gestures which are superior to Google’s efforts and remove the need for a navigation bar at the bottom of the phone. You can also edit which icons appear in the status bar, change the colour of the interface and other bits and pieces.

The ability to duplicate some apps, such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Uber is useful if you have multiple accounts tied to different phone numbers, and particularly useful for those who put two sims for two phone numbers in the phone.

In many ways, OxygenOS is closer to the lean and clean “stock” Android championed by enthusiasts than Google’s version of Android on its Pixel smartphones.

The big new thing for the OnePlus 6T is a fingerprint scanner embedded in the screen. It’s the second such device to ship with one after the Huawei Mate 20 Pro in October, but it is slightly faster and more accurate.

A spot that is slightly bigger than the one on the Mate 20 Pro lights up on the screen where you have to press your thumb to unlock the device or app and then pulses with a futuristic green glow as it scans your print.

You have to press your thumb or finger a little harder on the screen than you normally would on a rear-mounted sensor, and it is ever so slightly slower than the best of the old generation of sensors, but it works very well if you get it in the right spot.

Getting it in the right spot without looking at the phone takes a little getting used to, but within a couple of days I was able to pull off no-look unlocks round 90% of the time.

There’s also a very fast face unlock system using the selfie camera, but it isn’t 3D and so is less secure than rivals such as Apple’s Face ID or Huawei’s 3D face unlock.

The OnePlus 6T has the same 16+20-megapixel dual-camera system on the back as the OnePlus 6, and performs similarly, producing some really nice, well detailed images in good light. Low light performance is good, but not quite up to par with the best from Samsung, Huawei, Apple or Google.

The new nightscape low light mode does a good job of eliminating hand-shake from long-exposure shots. The selfie camera is also pretty good, but can be a little washed out and soft on detail in poor lighting. Portrait mode works as advertised.

Overall, the camera on the OnePlus 6T is good, but not quite the very best. Most will be very pleased, particularly if upgrading from a two-year-old phone.
• None When you use the fingerprint sensor the night mode for the display is disabled temporarily and then fades back in once you’ve unlocked the phone
• None The phone comes with a screen protector already on it
• None The single bottom-firing speaker is loud and has a relatively large amount of bass for the phone, but is easily blocked while playing a game
• None OnePlus’s alert slider switches between silent, vibrate and ring and is still brilliant

The OnePlus 6T costs £499 in mirror black with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.

The variant with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage is available in mirror or midnight black for £529, while the variant with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is available only in midnight black for £579.

For comparison, the 128GB Huawei Mate 20 Pro costs £900, the 64GB Google Pixel 3 XL costs £869, the 128GB Samsung Galaxy Note 9 costs £899, the 64GB iPhone XR costs £749 and the 64GB iPhone XS Max costs £1,099.

OnePlus phones have always been good for the money, offering top specifications in well-built devices, but not pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.

That’s changed for the OnePlus 6T. It is pushing what’s possible with the popular all-screen design using a tiny, attractive teardrop notch and a smaller chin, and it’s a better phone for it. But it is the introduction of a cutting-edge in-display fingerprint scanner, and making it work really well for as little as half the price of an iPhone XS, that is most impressive.

Sure, the camera isn’t quite as mind-blowing as the very best, there’s no wireless charging, it doesn’t have any of the fancy 3D face systems of some and it looks a little plain, but everything else is top notch. Even the software experience is excellent.

At £500, you have to spend an awful lot more money to get a better phone than the OnePlus 6T.

151,Technology,iPhone XR review: Apple's cheaper battery king,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/31/iphone-xr-review-apple-big-bezels-battery-face-id-screen,2018-10-31T06:00:14Z,"With Face ID and a decent screen, this phone attempts a happy medium between quality and price – but £750 still isn’t a bargain

The iPhone XR looks to offer most of what made the iPhone XS a knockout for £250 less – but with a colourful body and a slightly larger screen is this the iPhone to buy?

With the iPhone XS and XS Max starting at £999 and £1,099 respectively, Apple has room to shoehorn a slightly lower cost, but still expensive, model in underneath.

The iPhone XR is that model, but with a slightly larger screen than the 5.8in iPhone XS that’s also a little smaller than the 6.5in iPhone XS Max, it offers something subtly different too.

The 6.1in LCD is colourful and relatively crisp with excellent viewing angles, but just not quite as brilliant as the OLED displays on the top iPhones or rivals of a similar price.

The bezels are also noticeably larger than the other iPhones, making it look a little like an iPhone XS permanently in a case. The body is aluminium and glass, rather than having stainless steel sides, which makes it a little less slippery and easier to grip.

Despite being well made, it feels less luxurious than the iPhone XS or previous all-metal iPhones, but given most will put it in a case I suspect it won’t make much difference. It’s worth noting that Apple is not making cases for the iPhone XR, meaning third-party manufacturers are your only option.

The iPhone XR comes in a large range of colours. It looks stunning in the red or white colours, but a little cheap in the yellow option.

The increased screen size and larger bezels makes it 4.5mm wider than the iPhone XS, but 1.7mm narrower than the iPhone XS Max, which with its rounded edges makes the iPhone XR right on the limit of what I am able to use one-handed. Those with smaller hands will struggle. The iPhone XR is also wider than rivals such as the 6.1in Huawei P20 Pro, 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S9+ or the 6.4in Huawei Mate 20 Pro.

The iPhone XR has the same A12 Bionic chip as the iPhone XS and XS Max, but has only 3GB of RAM compared to 4GB for the more expensive models.

Day-to-day performance is indistinguishable between the new iPhones: iOS feels snappy and fluid, while gaming performance was similar too. There will be times where the iPhone XR will have worse performance because of the smaller amount of RAM, perhaps during heavy multitasking, but I couldn’t find any in real world usage.

Battery life on the other hand is all-round better than both the iPhone XS and XS Max, which lasted 24 and 27 hours respectively. The iPhone XR lasted over 32 hours between charges, matching last year’s iPhone X, meaning it would make it from a 7am wake up alarm until around 3pm the next day.

That was while using it as my primary device, sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.

The iPhone XR also technically has a slower 4G modem than the iPhone XS, but given that in real-world usage the limit on speed is not with the phone but the 4G provider, it is unlikely to make any difference.

The iPhone XR runs iOS 12 and is identical to the iPhone XS, complete with grouped notification handling and integrated wellbeing tools so you can keep an eye on your smartphone usage.

The lack of 3D touch means some of it works a little differently. To quick reply to a notification from lock screen you have to swipe left on it, select view, then reply, rather than just press harder on it.

Other tasks such as launching the camera from the lock screen are now activated by long-presses rather than hard-presses, but shortcuts from apps such as direct access to the selfie camera or a quick preview of the next event in your calendar are not supported.

The truth is I’ve never really used 3D touch gestures apart from the one to clear all notifications or for quick replies, so I didn’t miss them.

The iPhone XR has one-half of the iPhone XS’s camera, having the same 12-megapixel wide angle camera but not the 2x telephoto camera.

The result is a camera that captures very similar-looking standard photos to the excellent iPhone XS, with excellent dynamic range, colour and detail, and good low-light performance. In fact it’s not until you try to zoom in that you can really tell the difference. The 5x digital zoom is still surprisingly good, but it isn’t a patch on the hybrid zoom produced by the dual-camera system.

Likewise, portrait shots of people are good with a much wider angle than that produced by the iPhone XS, but you have to get closer to your target for the face detection to work properly and produce the effect. You’re also limited to shooting people and it lacks some of the more advanced lighting effects.

The selfie camera is identical to that on the iPhone XS, producing good but not overly detail-rich selfies.

Overall, the cameras on the iPhone XR are really good and a massive step up on the iPhone 7 or older, but not the best available on a smartphone.
• None Face ID is excellent, working just as well on the iPhone XR as it does on the iPhone XS
• None You need a USB-C to Lightning cable to fast charge the phone, but neither it nor a compatible charger are included in the box
• None The iPhone XR is water resistant to IP67 standards, which is the same as the iPhone X but worse than the iPhone XS
• None Wireless charging is great, but the iPhone heats up quite a lot while charging, more so than competitor phones

The iPhone XR is available in black, white, blue, yellow, coral and red, costing £749 with 64GB of storage, £799 with 128GB and £899 with 256GB.

For comparison, the 64GB iPhone XS costs £999, the 64GB iPhone XS Max costs £1,099, the 128GB Huawei P20 Pro costs £669, the 128GB Huawei Mate 20 Pro costs £900, the Samsung Galaxy S9 costs £639 and the 128GB OnePlus 6T costs £469.

The iPhone XR is an odd proposition. For many it will be the most attractive iPhone just because it is £250 cheaper than the iPhone XS, but it’s important to note that at £749 it is in no way cheap.

Many top-end rivals cost around the £750 mark while offering better screens, better cameras and more capabilities – and some even undercut it by as much as £250.

But for the Apple-only buyer, what you get with the iPhone XR is most of what makes the iPhone XS good, just not the bits that make it truly great. It doesn’t feel as luxurious, the bezels are larger and the screen isn’t as nice, the camera isn’t quite as capable and it isn’t the best iPhone you can buy, which undoubtedly is some of the appeal of a £999 smartphone.

The iPhone XR does last longer than the other 2018 iPhones, and it comes in some stunning colour options. If you must buy an iPhone but can’t or won’t spend £999 or more, the iPhone XR is the smartphone for you.

152,Technology,OnePlus 6T: cut-price flagship launches with in-screen fingerprint sensor,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/29/oneplus-6t-cut-price-flagship-android-smartphone-launches-in-screen-fingerprint-sensor,2018-10-29T16:30:02Z,"OnePlus is putting a stake in the ground with its latest smartphone, saying cutting-edge technology doesn’t need to cost the best part of £1,000.

The new OnePlus 6T, which starts at £499, has an all-screen design and large 6.41in FHD+ OLED display, but this time shrinks the notch at the top to a more bearable tiny teardrop shape, slims the chin at the bottom of the screen and fits a fingerprint scanner directly into the screen.

The rest of the metal and glass sandwich matches the OnePlus 6, released six months ago. It has Qualcomm’s top-end Snapdragon 845 processor, a choice of 6 or 8GB of RAM, a minimum of 128GB of storage up from just 64GB, dual-sim support and the latest version of Android 9 Pie.

The dual-camera system on the rear of the device is also the same, featuring one 16-megapixel and one 20-megapixel camera, both with optical stabilisation. But OnePlus said the computational photography algorithms have been tweaked for better colour balance and improved low-light performance using a new multi-frame Nightscape mode.

The OnePlus 6T has a slightly larger battery than its predecessor, but also includes the same fast-charge system, formerly known as Dash Charge before a trademark dispute, which has proven to be one of the fastest charging systems on the market.

OnePlus has made a name for itself for producing highly polished, fast and smooth high-spec smartphones at around half the price of top-end rivals.

The OnePlus 6T will be only the second mass-market phone to launch in the UK with the new in-display fingerprint scanner technology, following the £900 Huawei Mate 20 Pro, beating high-end rivals such as Samsung to what has been considered for years as the holy grail of fingerprint scanners.

OnePlus said that the 2D optical fingerprint scanner can be used 150 times a day for 10 years before failing and that it will unlock the phone in around 350ms. Both the back and front of the phone are covered in Corning Gorilla Glass 6, making the OnePlus 6T one of the first to market with the latest in hardened glass.

The phone no longer has a headphone socket, instead relying on its USB-C port and the included 3.5mm adapter for headphone support. It also has a new gaming mode that should improve performance, and new smart boost technology that speeds up game launches by between 5 and 20% compared to the OnePlus 6.

The Chinese smartphone upstart, now being carried by all the major UK mobile phone networks, said that the phone is “water resistant for every day use” but does not provide an industry standard IP rating.

The OnePlus 6T starts at £499 for 128GB of storage with 6GB of RAM and tops out at £579 with 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. The phone is available for pre-order in polished or frosted black and ships on 6 November.",0.9661,
153,Technology,Huawei Mate 20 Pro review: cutting-edge brilliance,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/29/huawei-mate-20-pro-cutting-edge-brilliance-in-display-fingerprint-and-3d-face-scanning-triple-camera-long-battery-life,2018-10-29T06:00:09Z,"With in-display fingerprint and 3D face scanning, triple camera and long battery life, Huawei has pulled off something special

Huawei has made really good phones for years, but the Mate 20 Pro is the Chinese firm’s first truly cutting-edge device with a triple camera, 3D face unlock and an in-screen fingerprint sensor.

The Mate series of phones has always delivered one thing above all else – battery life. This year Huawei has gone out of its way to deliver even more.

The Mate 20 Pro is the best feeling, most premium device the Chinese firm has made. It’s incredibly solid, smooth and well built, but at 189g is still surprisingly light and manageable compared to the 208g iPhone XS Max and 201g Samsung Galaxy Note 9.

It looks like the lovechild of an iPhone XS Max and a Galaxy S9+. The Huawei has the curved edges and metal band of the Galaxy, with the all-screen design and wide but shallow notch of the iPhone. The result is a striking phone that squeezes an enormous, beautiful and crisp 6.39in display into a manageable device that is narrower and easier to handle than any of its rivals.

The Mate 20 Pro is no small phone by anyone’s yardstick, but it doesn’t feel too big in your hand. You can use the phone one-handed, and I never felt like I was going to drop it.

Part of that is vinyl-like grooves in the glass back making what Huawei calls a “hyper-optical pattern”. It still feels smooth, almost silk-like to the touch, but run your nail over it and it sounds like a record. It gives the glass back a nice shine, but it also masks fingerprints and makes it considerably less slippery. It’s still glass, of course, so if you drop it it will still smash.

The bottom of the phone has the sim slot and a USB-C port, but no visible speaker, because the sound comes out of the USB-C port. It’s weird, but effective.
• None Connectivity: LTE, Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth 5 and GPS (dual-sim available in some regions)

The Mate 20 Pro is the first device to use Huawei’s new Kirin 980 processor, which the company says is a significant improvement on last year’s Kirin 970, and is one of the first chips produced using 7nm processes.

Performance was excellent throughout, matching rivals running Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845 such as the OnePlus 6 or Google’s Pixel 3 XL. Launching apps and switching between them was rapid with no noticeable lag anywhere during general use. Gaming performance was excellent too, both in smooth frame rates and in battery efficiency, with a 30 minute bout of Shadowgun Legends consuming around 9% battery and staying cool throughout.

Even with Huawei’s gaming mode active, which turns up the processor to maximum, battery consumption and heat weren’t much higher. Performance should be even better for games that support the firm’s GPU Turbo system.

Battery life was excellent too. With heavy usage it lasted about 35 hours between charges, meaning it would make it all the way from 7am on day one until 6pm on day two. That was with hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, lots of browsing, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, watching 60 minutes of Netflix, 30 minutes of gaming and shooting about 10 photos a day.

With lighter general usage the Mate 20 Pro got closer to 48 hours between charges, and will last far longer with one of Huawei’s power saving or ultra power saving modes. If you needed the phone to last for three days it genuinely could – maybe even longer.

A full charge took under an hour via cable with the included 40W charger, hitting 30% in 13 minutes. The Mate 20 Pro can charge up to 15W wirelessly too, and with the flip of a switch, can wirelessly charge other devices, including other phones and headphones. You have been able to do similar via USB-C cable for a while, but back-to-back wireless charging of another phone is certainly a novelty.

Huawei’s smartphones run a customised version of Android called EMUI, here based on the latest Android 9 Pie.

Some will love it, others will hate it. EMUI 9 is the most polished version yet, with more refined animations and actions, but it still has some odd quirks.

It uses an old-school button for the app drawer, for instance, but has complete theming support, so it’s easy to change the look of icons, colours and the wallpaper.

It’s also got Huawei’s version of Google Lens called HiVision, which does image and product recognition using Amazon, a load of knuckle-based gestures for things such as screenshots and opening apps, plus a mini-display mode which shrinks what’s on screen into the bottom right or left corner so it’s easier to reach.

EMUI 9 still has the standard Android navigation buttons that Google ditched for the Pixel 3, but it also has a weird floating navigation dock-come-joystick thing and full swipe gestures as options. The swipe from the left or right edge of the screen to go back is a nice idea.

Huawei also has its own version of Google’s digital wellbeing tools showing you how long you use your phone, which apps, how many times you unlock it and with the ability to set limits.

There are a lot of options throughout, but it doesn’t feel overbearing. One area that is strangely lacking in customisation options is the status bar. The notch in the screen is quite wide, leaving little room for icons. If you have the phone set to vibrate only, you can only fit the battery, time and vibrate symbol in the right side. With two sims and wifi connected, there’s only room for the Bluetooth icon, which is replaced when a mail or similar notification pops up. It would be good to be able to prune back the status bar icons for more room.

Huawei’s biggest change to Android is in power saving features. The system is much more aggressive at blocking apps from running in the background than Google’s battery systems. This is fine for the most part, but you might have to whitelist some apps such as Strava to make sure they work correctly.

The Mate 20 Pro comes with two cutting-edge biometric options. The first is a 3D IR face scanning system very similar to that used in the iPhone XS. It projects 30,000 dots onto your face to detect its contours and securely recognise you.

With raise-to-wake and the option to skip the lockscreen when you’re recognised, it is so fast you could be forgiven for thinking it was broken. You can also get it to unlock but not go straight to the home screen, and only reveal notification contents when you’re recognised, like Apple’s Face ID system.

The second is an optical fingerprint sensor embedded directly into the screen about a third of the way up. A patch lights up to show you where to put your thumb. You have to be a bit more precise with your finger placement, and it isn’t as quick as Huawei’s recent capacitive fingerprint scanners, but it still works great.

In fact the two work really well in conjunction. The facial recognition works brilliantly for unlocking the phone, but can’t be used for apps that are expecting a fingerprint, which is where the fingerprint scanner comes in.

Huawei’s triple camera returns for the Mate 20 Pro, this time with the monochrome camera from the P20 Pro swapped for a ultra-wide angle camera.

The main camera is 40 megapixels, the ultra-wide is 20-megapixels and there’s a third eight-megapixel telephoto camera. The trio work in conjunction to shoot 10-megapixel images by default that can go from 0.6 to 5x hybrid zoom then out to 10x with digital zoom on top.

It’s a very potent combination. I used the ultra-wide angle camera at 0.6x zoom more than I thought I would, and 1x, 3x and 5x zoom levels were very good and got you a lot closer to the action than a standard 2x zoom. The super macro mode is also excellent, which gets you far closer to an object than you normally good and still focus. Anyone who likes taking macro shots will love it.

General images were very similar to the excellent P20 Pro, with a superb amount of detail and colour accuracy. It doesn’t quite have the same dynamic range in challenging lighting conditions as the Pixel 3, but its low-light performance was great and it’s dedicated night mode is very impressive.

The Master AI is also improved from the P20 Pro, but it still occasionally suggests tweaks to photos that tend to over saturate some elements giving it an Instagrammed look. You can cancel the changes with a little toast notification that pops up on the screen, but only before you’ve shot the photo.

The 24-megapixel front-facing selfie takes images that are relatively soft in detail without activating the face-thinning mode or skin smoothing. There’s also 3D live emojis using the front-facing camera to mimic your expressions in cutesy characters just like Apple’s Animoji.
• None Bluetooth connectivity to a set of wireless earbuds was excellent
• None 4G performance was far better than some rivals, holding onto usable signal in more places without draining the battery
• None The twilight colour does not have the hyper optical pattern on the glass back
• None The phone supports new nano memory cards, not microSD cards, which might prove difficult to buy
• None Huawei’s haptics are greatly improved, although not quite on a par with Apple’s
• None It is not available to buy in the US following Huawei’s effective ban by the Trump administration

The Huawei Mate 20 Pro costs £900 with 128GB of storage.

For comparison, the Huawei P20 Pro costs £799 with 128GB storage, the Google Pixel 3 XL costs £869 with 64GB, the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 costs £899 with 128GB, the OnePlus 6 costs £469 with 64GB and the iPhone XS Max costs £1,099 with 64GB.

Huawei has pulled off something quite remarkable with the Mate 20 Pro. Normally devices with this many cutting-edge new technologies end up as spec-monsters but poor experiences.

But the Mate 20 Pro is anything but a poor experience. It’s a refined, beautiful piece of hardware that manages to squeeze what reads like a tech enthusiast’s ultimate wishlist into a truly impressive phone. You’ve got the in-display fingerprint sensor, 3D face recognition, a powerful processor, fantastic screen, wireless charging and even the ability to wirelessly charge other devices.

Then there are is the excellent triple camera system on the back and a monster battery that’ll last well into a second day, possibly even longer, which charges super fast too. It’s even relatively easy to grip and use given the huge 6.39in display.

Huawei’s EMUI 9 certainly won’t be to everyone’s taste, and it doesn’t quite raise the bar the way the Android version on Google’s Pixel 3 has, but it is well optimised and smooth in operation and most of it can be customised if you don’t like the way it works or looks.

The Mate 20 Pro is certainly not cheap at £900, but you get a hell of a lot of phone for your money, and a quality experience with it. This may be the best phone of the year.

154,Money,Can 'co-living' solve millennials' housing woes?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/oct/26/co-living-millennials-housing-woes-property-developers-uk,2018-10-26T13:06:55Z,"For millennials struggling to get on the housing ladder, is this the shape of living in the future? Developers across the UK are building “co-living” blocks for rental only, promising fully-furnished apartments, a “professional” landlord, and round-the-clock concierges.

Many have spacious communal lounges, rooftop gardens and gyms. Angus Dodd, the chief executive of Quintain, which is behind a project in Wembley, north-west London, says: “It is a hotel-style service for long-term renters.”

Usually the rent includes utility bills and wifi, and many of the rental management companies have scrapped letting fees and deposits. In total, the number of new-build rental units completed or under construction is 50,000 across the UK.

For many, it will be the next logical step from a university hall of residence as they settle into their first job. For the companies behind it – such as pensions firm Legal & General – it promises safe and steady returns for their investors.

But there are drawbacks. The rents, while all inclusive, are often high, especially in London. Would you pay £1,200 to £1,400 a month for a studio flat in outer London? While living in these apartments, many millennials are likely to find it tough to save for a deposit on a house purchase while paying such high rents.

Many people will love the concept of co-living, but others might see it as a “kidult” community of young adults not properly growing up.

Simon Nosworthy, the head of residential property at Osbornes Law, is sceptical that co-living will necessarily foster a genuine community spirit. “It could be a soulless co-living space and may feel like living in a hostel or hotel rather than a home – a transient space where people are going to be passing in and out.”

So what’s on offer in the new world of corporate-built co-living spaces?

The UK’s biggest build-to-rent development, with 5,000 rental homes managed by Tipi, is Wembley Park, beside Wembley stadium in north-west London. The newest building, Landsby, features Scandinavian-style interiors kitted out by Samsung and John Lewis.

The apartments are reasonably sized, from 39 sq metres for a studio and 52 sq metres for a one-bed flat to 90 sq metres for a three-bed. Monthly rents in the Landsby building start at £1,450 for a studio and £1,590 for a one-bedroom flat, and go up to £2,200 for a two-bed and £3,000 for a three-bed.

Built by the insurance firm Legal & General, Slate Yard in Salford has 225 rental homes of good sizes, from 41.8 sq metres to 86 sq metres. Rents range from £895 a month for a one-bed to £1,800 for a three-bed.

The residents lounge offers free coffee and tenants are encouraged to paint their flats. Slate Yard along with L&G’s 10 other developments around the country offer six-month to five-year leases with annual CPI inflation-linked rental increases capped at 5%.

East Village in Stratford, east London, is the former Olympic athletes’ quarters, which were turned into 2,800 homes. Rents range from £1,690 for a one-bed with an average size of 40.8 sq metres to £2,686 for a 92.4 sq metre three-bed. At Elephant Central, there are 374 flats across three buildings where rents start at £1,820 for a one-bed, £2,231 for a two-bed and £3,683 for a three-bed.

Skyline II in Manchester boasts a 20m rooftop swimming pool, Jacuzzi and winter garden. The company behind it, the property asset manager Long Harbour, claims its 129 apartments offer the standard of a five-star hotel.

One-bed flats cost between £950 and £1,050 to rent, while two-beds are between £1,150 and £1,350.

Long Harbour’s other developments, The Lansdowne in Birmingham with 206 rental homes and The Wullcomb in Leicester with 297 flats, are due to open next year. Rents at the Lansdowne range from £855 for a one-bed flat to £1,200 for a two-bed. The Wullcomb will be cheaper at £700 for a one-bed to £1,000 for a two-bed.

Rajdeep Gahir, a former banker who used to work for the US shared workspace firm WeWork, has teamed up with the architect Dara Huang to set up Vivahouse. They have designed room modules whose panels fit in a lift and can be put together within hours in existing spaces, such as empty office buildings.

The rooms will measure just 8.5 sq metres to 12 sq metres, but Gahir says they have been cleverly designed to accommodate a flip double bed, desk and wardrobe and have been sound-proofed. Residents – typically 20- to-30-year-old graduates – will share bathrooms, kitchens and lounges in a 30-room Vivahouse.

Rooms can be rented from one night up to three months, for £900-plus a month. “This is for generation move,” says Gahir.",0.9858,
155,Technology,Apple and Samsung fined for deliberately slowing down phones,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/24/apple-samsung-fined-for-slowing-down-phones,2018-10-24T12:46:00Z,"Apple and Samsung are being fined €10m and €5m respectively in Italy for the “planned obsolescence” of their smartphones.

An investigation launched in January by the nation’s competition authority found that certain smartphone software updates had a negative effect on the performance of the devices.

Believed to be the first ruling of its kind against smartphone manufacturers, the investigation followed accusations operating system updates for older phones slowed them down, thereby encouraging the purchase of new phones.

In a statement the antitrust watchdog said “Apple and Samsung implemented dishonest commercial practices” and that operating system updates “caused serious malfunctions and significantly reduced performance, thus accelerating phones’ substitution”.

It added the two firms had not provided clients adequate information about the impact of the new software “or any means of restoring the original functionality of the products”.

Samsung told owners of its Galaxy Note 4 phone to install a new version of Google’s Android operating system intended for the more recent Galaxy Note 7, but which users claimed rendered the old model sluggish.

Likewise, Apple told iPhone 6 owners to install an operating system designed for the iPhone 7, leading to problems for owners of the older model.

Both firms were issued the maximum fine of €5m each and ordered to display a notice on their Italian websites informing customers of the watchdog’s decision.

Apple was fined an additional €5m for failing to give customers clear information about “essential” characteristics of lithium batteries, including their average life expectancy, how to maintain them or eventually replace them in the firm’s iPhones.

Apple acknowledged in December that it had intentionally slowed iPhones with degraded batteries through software updates to avoid sudden shutdown problems, but denied it had ever done anything to intentionally shorten the life of a product.

The company later apologised for its actions and reduced the cost of battery replacements. It also added battery health information to iOS and allowed users to turn off the slowing down of the iPhone’s processor.

The Italian antitrust authority opened its investigation following customer complaints around the same time as a similar probe in France, which has yet to conclude.

It is a crime under French law to intentionally shorten the life of any product in order to promote sales. The French consumer protection agency has the power to fine up to 5% of annual turnover or impose a jail term.

Apple also faced questions from the US senate in January over the slowing of iPhones, and a barrage of class-action lawsuits from around the country. More than 60 separate US lawsuits were ordered to be consolidated into a single suit in the Northern District of California, which is still ongoing.

Samsung’s software updates for its phones have not previously been questioned.

A Samsung spokesperson said the company was disappointed by the decision and intends to appeal the fine: “Samsung did not issue any software update that reduced the Galaxy Note 4’s performance. In contrast, Samsung has always released software updates enabling our customers to have the best experience possible.”

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

156,Technology,Google Pixel 3 XL review: big is still beautiful,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/24/google-pixel-3-xl-review-big-device-performance-camera-screen,2018-10-24T05:00:03Z,"This device picks up where last year’s version left off, with smooth performance, excellent camera and fantastic screen

Google’s iPhone XS Max competitor brings a big screen, a big notch and a big glass body, but is the Pixel 3 XL good enough to beat the phablet kings?

The smaller of Google’s new Pixel smartphones is arguably the best small Android phone going, and the Pixel 3 XL shares many of its best traits.

The backs of the devices are a spitting image of each other – two-tone glass, part polished, part etched. The glossy coated metal sides and glass back have a luxurious, smooth feel in the hand.

The etched surface hides the mess of fingerprints usually associated with glass-backed phones, but is slightly more slippery than the polished section. After a couple of weeks it became a little less slippery, but at 76.7mm wide the Pixel 3 XL is not a small phone.

Handling it one-handed is a challenge, but its lighter 184g weight helps compared with the 208g iPhone XS Max and 201g Samsung Galaxy Note 9.

The 6.3in screen is beautiful. Crisp, colourful and improved over last year. It’s not quite as eye-popping as Samsung or Apple’s best, but it is very close, and the difference is now down to a matter of taste.

There is, however, a massive notch containing the dual selfie camera and speaker. Aesthetic debates aside, it’s important to note that because the notch is so tall it takes up a big chunk of the screen at the top, with the area either side exclusively being used for the status bar.

As such, despite being 0.3in bigger on the diagonal than the Pixel 2 XL, the Pixel 3 XL has essentially only gained a status-bar’s height on the screen compared with last year’s phone. The usable screen area therefore works out about 0.3mm taller than the Pixel 2 XL, as Android ignores the space either side of the notch in most full-screen apps such as Netflix, Amazon or most other video apps. YouTube and Google Photos are the most obvious exceptions.

There isn’t enough room either side of the notch for most of the status bar icons either. If you have the battery percentage visible, the phone connected to wifi and set to vibrate, if you connect a set of Bluetooth headphones you end up with a dot in the right side of the status bar indicating there are more icons needed than can fit.

The same goes for notification icons on the left, which have to fit in the small area between the time and the notch. Google is not alone in having this problem, but it is very pronounced on the Pixel 3 XL.

The Pixel 3 has Qualcomm’s current top-of-the-line processor the Snapdragon 845, as used in the OnePlus 6 and most other current flagship smartphones, with the exception of the UK versions of Samsung’s S9 and Note 9 and Huawei’s phones, both of which use their own-brand chips.

The Pixel 3 only has 4GB of RAM, compared with 6GB or even 8GB in some top-end Android competitors. While it might lose in a game of Top Trumps, it’s not noticeable in daily use because the Pixel 3 is simply buttery-smooth in operation, with top-notch gaming performance too.

I noticed some aggressive background app handling. If you shoot 14 photos in rapid concession while listening to Spotify, the Pixel 3 XL will terminate Spotify in the background, stopping the music. I only encountered this behaviour when actively looking for it, however.

Battery life was similar to the smaller Pixel 3, managing just over 24 hours between charges. Used as my primary device, sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music with Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, watching 30 minutes of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day, the Pixel 3 XL made it from my 7am alarm to about 7.30am the next morning.

Lighter usage saw another couple of hours of battery life. Charging is fast via the included USB-C cable, and via the Pixel Stand wireless charger, but limited to only 5W via current third-party wireless chargers.

The Pixel 3 XL runs the latest version of Android 9 Pie with Google’s new mandatory gesture controls replacing the traditional back, home and overview navigation buttons, and Gmail’s new Smart Compose on mobile, which makes writing dull emails less laborious.

Google hasn’t made any alterations specifically for the larger 6.3in screen on the Pixel 3 XL, but Gboard supports one-handed typing mode and the gesture button is easy to reach with your thumb.

There are digital wellbeing tools, including time trackers and Google’s Wind Down, which activates do not disturb and sets the screen to monochrome to dissuade you from using it.

Overall this is the smoothest, most refined version of Android available on any smartphone, rivalling Apple’s iOS on the iPhone XS for slickness.
• None Android 9 Pie: everything you need to know

The Pixel 3 XL has the exact same camera as fitted to its smaller sibling, and as such as genuinely brilliant, capturing richly detailed and vibrant images in practically any lighting condition with little to no photographic skill required.

New for the Pixel 3 is Google’s Super Res Zoom, which is an enhanced digital zoom that works very well, but can’t quite beat rivals with telescopic cameras at maximum magnification. The on-device AI-powered Top Shot advisor captures multiple frames before and after you hit the shutter button and flags when it thinks it’s got a better image than you managed manually.

The portrait mode is also great, despite the lack of another camera on the back. On the front there’s a dual selfie camera system, one standard and one ultra wide-angle camera, which means you can squeeze more people into a shot.

For more detail on the camera performance, please see the Pixel 3 review.

The Pixel Stand is an optional £69 wireless-charging stand that has two unique features for the Pixel 3 and 3 XL. The first is the ability to wirelessly charge the new Google smartphones at 10W. Third-party Qi wireless chargers can currently only charge the Pixel 3 and 3 XL at 5W, although certified Made for Google wireless chargers will be available at the later date that can charge the phones at the full 10W.

The second is it turns the smartphone into a portrait Google Assistant smart display, a little like the Google Home Hub. When you put the phone on the stand with the screen off it launches Google Assistant mode, which either lights an ambient display with time, date and notifications like normal, with an added Google Assistant box at the bottom, or displays a selection of your Google Photos.

It also activates the smart-speaker-like always-listening mode that waits for the wake words “Hey Google”, firing up Google Assistant barking out answers using the speakers and displaying results on the screen.

It can also act as a sunrise alarm, lighting up the screen 15 minutes before your morning alarm goes off in warm red to yellow tones, and lights up with a live feed from the front door if someone rings the Nest Hello doorbell you might have.

It works well enough, but is expensive for a wireless charger and I suspect few will deem it an essential purchase.
• None You get a set of USB-C earphones and a USB-C to 3.5mm converter in the box
• None The speakers are really quite loud and clear with pretty good stereo separation (although the bottom speaker is louder than the top one)
• None You can turn the screen face down to switch on do not disturb
• None The phone also has an eSim, which will be activated through a software update later this year with EE confirmed to support it
• None You can squeeze the sides to trigger Google Assistant

The Google Pixel 3 XL is available for £869 with 64GB of storage or £969 with 128GB of storage, in a choice of black, white or pink.

For comparison, the 64GB Pixel 3 costs £739, the Huawei P20 Pro costs £669, the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 costs £899, the OnePlus 6 costs £469 and the 64GB iPhone XS costs £999.

The Pixel 3 XL is a great smartphone, but unlike last year’s XL offering, it isn’t necessarily the best Google phone – the smaller, cheaper Pixel 3 is in many ways a better phone.

The Pixel 3 XL is a slick, attractive and lovely-feeling device, but it’s also pretty big and relatively slippery, making it more difficult to handle than last year’s Pixel 2 XL. Its lighter weight is an advantage against rivals in reducing the potential hand pain caused by its size though.

It’s got a cracking camera, and a beautiful screen, but the notch might put some off. I didn’t generally notice its presence except when it blocked status bar icons, which I found annoying.

While £869 is definitely not cheap, it does undercut the top-end, big-screen rivals such as the Note 9 and iPhone XS Max by a little or a lot. So if you want a big screen and a super-refined Android experience, the Pixel 3 XL is the one to buy.

157,Technology,iPhone XR review roundup: cheaper and brighter with longer battery life,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/23/iphone-xr-review-roundup-cheaper-brighter-battery-longer-iphone-xs,2018-10-23T12:15:19Z,"The first wave of verdicts from select reviewers given early access to Apple’s latest iPhone XR are here, and if their thoughts are any indication of what to expect, cheaper means better.

The £999 iPhone XS and £1,099 XS Max were brilliant in many ways, but were a little on the expensive side. But the iPhone XR costs £749, has the same processor, same Face ID and same look as the £250 more expensive models, with a 6.1in LCD screen instead of a 5.8in or 6.5in OLED screen.

The Guardian, not given early access to the new phones, will review them at a later date. For now, this is what a privileged few thought of the cheaper, but not exactly cheap, 2018 iPhone.

Scott Stein writing for Cnet seems suggest think the iPhone XR is the hot-hatch of the iPhone world:

I haven’t been this excited about an iPhone model in years. The iPhone XR is built to be the best everyday phone engine in Apple’s iPhone lineup, based on things I value: price, battery, speed and key features like the camera. The iPhone XR is the sensible car with the good gas mileage, but with a supercharged engine under the hood and an understated spoiler on the trunk – and I love that. It’s what more Apple products should shoot for. It’s a good size and, very nearly, a perfect phone for its price.

For Lauren Goode, writing for Wired, the iPhone XR is a nice package, but one that doesn’t quite push the envelope:

Chris Velazco writing for Engadget reckons that the lower cost isn’t noticeable compared to the iPhone XS:

The XR is a little wider, thicker and taller than the XS, but it never feels unwieldy. In fact, since it in sits in a nice little sweet spot between the XS and the massive Max, the XR arguably offers the best blend of size and usability. Build quality is up to Apple’s usual standards, which is to say it’s impeccable. The iPhone XR may cost less than the phones I reviewed a month ago, but it doesn’t feel like it. In fact, I’ve come to prefer the XR’s design over the others

Joanna Stern writing for the Wall Street Journal agrees, this is arguably the best iPhone for this year:

The long-held iPhone-nomics theory is that when you spend more, you get proportionately more, but the XR defies that. Sure, there are some XR trade-offs, including a lower-contrast, lower-resolution LCD screen and a single camera on the back. But I barely noticed the differences in everyday use. Actually, after using the XR, I believe the XS has a bigger trade-off – namely, shorter battery life. When weighing the two options, decide what features you care about most. And keep in mind that, for most people, the “XS” stands for X … S … ive.

For Rhiannon Williams writing for the i newspaper the cheaper screen is noticeable:

This is likely to be one of the main reasons why the iPhone XR is less expensive: OLED technology is pricey but makes for richer, super-sharp and detailed displays. The iPhone XR’s display is still bright, but its 828 x 1792 pixel resolution lacks the pin-sharpness afforded by OLED technology. For many people, this won’t make a great amount of difference on a day-to-day basis, but it’s noticeably duller if you’ve become accustomed to OLED.

While colours are appreciated Alex Cranz writing for Gizmodo notes the iPhone XR can look a little cheap:

The first thing you’ll notice on most iPhone XRs is the colour. The XR is the first phone Apple’s produced in a playful colour palate in a while. Besides the traditional white and black, there’s also a lovely red, coral, yellow and blue. The colours are eye-catching, though the aluminium sides don’t match the vibrant glass backs. Consequently, the phone can look a little cheap, especially next to the stainless steel sides on the XS.

The iPhone XR doesn’t have Apple’s pressure-sensitive screen, but Brian X Chen writing for the New York Times doesn’t care:

Nilay Patel writing for the Verge doesn’t miss the telephoto lens on the back:

I rarely take zoom photos, so I didn’t miss the telephoto lens from the iPhone XS at all — especially since the iPhone XR can still take portrait photos with its single lens. In fact, I preferred the XR’s portrait mode to the XS, because the XR’s brighter f/1.8 lens and larger image sensor is much better in low light than the telephoto camera the XS uses for portrait shots. The quality of XS portrait mode shots tends to drop fairly quickly in low light, but the XR is actually pretty respectable. And the XR also takes wider angle portrait shots than the iPhone XS or the Pixel 3, which I find tremendously useful.

But Edward C Baig writing for USA Today misses the ability to use Portrait mode on objects rather than people:

The XR has a version of Portrait Mode, too, but Apple accomplishes the bokeh effect not with a separate camera, but through software and machine learning. The result isn’t quite as precise. On iPhones with dual rear cameras, you get a closer image with a more accurate sense of depth. What’s more, the Portrait Mode on the XR works only when you’re shooting people. And while, granted, this is typically how you take advantage of the feature, I sometimes also use Portrait mode on other phones to shoot flowers or other close-up objects.

If you want an iPhone to last as long as possible between charges, the iPhone XR is it, according to Gareth Beavis, writing for TechRadar:

We won’t beat around the bush here. The iPhone XR completely backs up one of Apple’s big claims: that it offers the best battery life of any phone from the Cupertino brand. Finally, we’re looking at an iPhone that can last for the whole day without giving battery anxiety. Of course, your mileage will vary with any phone, but we’re really impressed to see all the little tricks offered by the iPhone XS’ battery management (such as being able to be very power efficient when working as a car navigation system on GPS) but also just being able to go into a nice power-saving mode.

The iPhone XS and XS Max might be the best iPhones on paper for 2018, the consensus appears to be that a saving of £250 of the iPhone XR is worth the trade-off with slightly less boundary-pushing technology.

Although it’s worth noting that if you’re open to other manufacturers, £749 is around the same price as the top-spec Samsung, Google or OnePlus device of similar size, meaning while the iPhone XR may cost less than the iPhone XS, it’s definitely not cheap.",0.9994,
158,Music,Do androids dream of electric beats? How AI is changing music for good,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/22/ai-artificial-intelligence-composing,2018-10-22T13:00:06Z,"The first testing sessions for SampleRNN – an artificially intelligent software originally developed by machine-learning researcher Dr. Soroush Mehri and expanded by Carr and Zukowski, aka the Dadabots – sounded more like a screamo gig than a machine-learning experiment. Carr and Zukowski hoped their program could generate full-length black metal and math rock albums by feeding it small chunks of sound. The first trial consisted of encoding and entering in a few Nirvana a cappellas. “When it produced its first output,” Carr tells me over email, “I was expecting to hear silence or noise because of an error we made, or else some semblance of singing. But no. The first thing it did was scream about Jesus. We looked at each other like, ‘What the fuck?’” But while the platform could convert Cobain’s grizzled pining into bizarre testimonies to the goodness of the Lord, it couldn’t keep a steady rhythm, much less create a coherent song.

Artificial intelligence is already used in music by streaming services such as Spotify, which scan what we listen to so they can better recommend what we might enjoy next. But AI is increasingly being asked to compose music itself – and this is the problem confronting many more computer scientists besides Dadabots.

Musicians – popular, experimental and otherwise – have been using AI to varying degrees over the last three decades. Pop’s chief theoretician, Brian Eno, used it not only to create new endlessly perpetuating music on his recent album Reflection but to render an entire visual experience in 2016’s The Ship. The arrangements on Mexican composer Ivan Paz’s album Visions of Space, which sounds a bit like an intergalactic traffic jam, were done by algorithms he created himself. Most recently, producer Baauer – who topped the US charts in 2012 with his viral track Harlem Shake – made Hate Me with Lil Miquela, an artificial digital Instagram avatar. The next step for synthetic beings like these is to create music on their own – that is, if they can get the software to shut up about Jesus.

The first computer-generated score, a string quartet called the Illiac Suite, was developed in 1957 by Lejaren Hiller, and was met with massive controversy among the classical community. Composers at the time were intensely purist. “Most musicians, academic or composers, have always held this idea that the creation of music is innately human,” Californian music professor David Cope explains. “Somehow the computer program was a threat to that unique human aspect of creation.” Fast forward to 1980, and after an insufferable bout of composer’s block, Cope began building a computer that could read music from a database written in numerical code. Seven years later, he’d created Emi (Experiments in Musical Intelligence, pronounced “Emmy”). Cope would compose a piece of music and pass it along to his staff to transcribe the notation into code for Emi to analyse. After many hours of digestion, Emi would spit out an entirely new composition written in code that Cope’s staff would re-transcribe on to staves. Emi could respond not just to Cope’s music, but take in the sounds of Bach, Mozart and other classical music staples and conjure a piece that could fit their compositional style. In the nearly 40 years since, this foundational process has been improved in all manner of ways.

YouTube singing sensation Taryn Southern has constructed an LP composed and produced completely by AI using a reworking of Cope’s methods. On her album I AM AI, Southern uses an open source AI platform called Amper to input preferences such as genre, instrumentation, key and beats per minute. Amper is an artificially intelligent music composer founded by film composers Drew Silverstein, Sam Estes and Michael Hobe: it takes commands such as “moody pop” or “modern classical” and creates mostly coherent records that match in tone. From there, an artist can choose to select specific changes in melody, rhythm instrumentation and more.

Southern, who says she “doesn’t have a traditional music background,” sometimes rejects as many as 30 versions of each song generated by Amper from her parameters; once Amper creates something she likes the sound of, she exports it to GarageBand, arranges what the program has come up with and adds lyrics. Southern’s DIY model foretells a future of musicians making music with AI on their personal computers. “As an artist,” she says, “if you have a barrier to entry, like whether costs are prohibiting you to make something or not having a team, you kind of hack your way into figuring it out.” Her persistence in low-cost collaboration opened up partnerships with Samsung, Google and HTC, and she is now working on ways to make AI and VR art more accessible.

AI isn’t just a useful tool, though – it can be used to explore vital questions about the nature of human expression. This self-reflective impulse epitomises the ethic of New York’s art-tech collective the Mill. “The overarching theme of my work,” explains creative director Rama Allen, “is playing with the concept of the ‘ghost in the machine’: the ghost being the human spirit and the machine being whatever advanced technology we try to apply. I’m interested in the collaboration between the two and the unexpected results that can come from it.” This is the central theme behind the Mill’s musical AI project See Sound, which debuted at last year’s SXSW festival in Austin – a highly reactive sound-sculpture program engineered by the human voice. Hum, sing or rap and See Sound etches a digital sculpture from your vocals on its colourful interface. From there, Allen and his team 3D-print the brand new shape. The sculptures themselves are, Allen says, “like a fingerprint”.

The project was born when Allen saw London beatboxer Reeps One live and began to think about the reciprocal relationship between his machine mimicry and music. “I thought, what if I could create another piece of technology that allows him to visualise a shape in his mind, and breathe that shape into existence?” See Sound is one of the most intriguing examples of the ways artists and AI can learn from one another to create something new – advancing the idea of data-driven input into a more reciprocal relationship between man and machine.

But while Allen, Southern and Dadabots exemplify an ideal harmony, the reality is that artificial intelligence is an industry, and the utopian synergy of the experimenters’ projects will undoubtedly give way to manipulation – even outright exploitation – by commerce. Spotify’s brilliant machine-learning program delivers recommendations to its listeners, and the company hired AI savant François Pachet to further the company’s entrenchment in the field. Pachet worked on Sony’s Flow Machines, a program that uses AI to compose pop songs. Spotify has already been accused of pushing fake artists in its playlists – mere pseudonyms for conveyor-belt pop made by a team of shadowy producers to evade royalty payouts, a charge it denies – so will they begin to produce their own AI-developed music? Amazon’s AI assistant Alexa features a new skill called DeepMusic which interweaves layers of audio samples to match the vibe set by users. And while the tunes sound too much like a computer drummed them up, that Amazon can already pipe music developed by AI into homes makes for a murky interplay between corporation, in-home AI assistant and creator.

As the Guardian reported last year, startups such as AI Music are working on tools that “shape shift” existing songs to match the context in which they’re played; such as switching up the rhythms while driving or increasing the bass as the listener is jogging. Patrick Stobbs, co-founder of AI music composer Jukedeck, recently mentioned that the program would move from tweaking music to actually synthesising it. The London-based company, whose customer base requires what has been described as “functional music”, has already produced work for the likes of Coca-Cola and Google. You can imagine a future where not only hold music is produced by AI, but also music for adverts, TV series and unobtrusive dinner party soundtracks; as well as the blue- and increasingly white-collar workers whose jobs are being replaced by AI, composers could be under threat too.

But artists who use AI are steadfast that their work aims to augment the lives of artists and non-artists alike, not replace them. “At this point it’s more surprising to us to hear what humans will do with it,” Carr of Dadabots tells me. “Everything we’re doing is one big scheme to collaborate with bands we love.”

An AI-assisted future raises questions around existing inequalities, corporate domination, and artistic integrity: how can we thrive in a world of automation and AI-assisted work without exacerbating the social and economic schisms that have persisted for centuries? It’s likely we won’t. But in the most utopian vision, music will be the first foray into machine-learning for many people, allowing collaboration that edifies the listener, the musician and the machine.",0.9978,
159,Technology,What is the best computer monitor for under £200?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2018/oct/18/what-is-the-best-windows-desktop-pc-computer-monitor-under-200-pounds,2018-10-18T10:48:28Z,"There are two ways to pick a monitor, and it’s worth using both approaches. The first is to go into a shop and see which one looks best. It’s much easier to compare screens side by side. The second is to compile a table of specifications and pick the monitor that meets your needs. 



Reading spec sheets doesn’t guarantee that you’ll find a monitor that looks good, but this generally isn’t a problem nowadays. The quality of flat screens has improved dramatically over the past 10-15 years, and it’s quite hard to find a bad one, unless it’s a faulty product.



The prices of standard PC monitors and flat screen TVs have also fallen dramatically. Monitors start at less than £100 and you can get a good one for less than £150. Of course, you can pay up to £1,000 for a bigger, faster, high-resolution screen, but you don’t need that sort of monitor unless you’re a keen gamer or a video editor. 



There’s one specification to watch out for: some cheap monitors have TN (Twisted Nematic) LCD screens. They are not necessarily bad, but IPS (In Plane Switching) and LED backlit screens are brighter and have richer colours.



In general, a brightness of around 200 candela per square metre, “200 nits”, is enough for use in normal indoor lighting, and 120-200 cd/m2 used to be common. However, there’s a trend towards brighter screens, with 500cd/m2 being preferred for movies. HDTV sets go even higher.



If a screen is too bright, you can always turn it down. Only if it’s too dim do you have a problem.

Today’s standard PC monitor has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which matches the TV industry definitions for 1080p and Full High Definition (Full HD) movies. As prices have come down, some people are moving to Quad HD (2560 x 1440) and Ultra HD (3840 x 2160). There are also ultra-wides (2560 x 1080) that avoid having two screens side by side.



Normal screen sizes vary from around 21.5in to 28in, and 24in is currently the sweet spot. Most of these screens have the same 1920 x 1080 resolution, so you won’t fit any more information on a bigger screen. However, everything on the screen will be slightly bigger and easier to read. Against that, a bigger screen will also have fewer pixels per inch (ppi), so it will look less sharp.



Unless you’re on a tight budget, there’s not much point in buying anything smaller than 24in, because you won’t save any space. In fact, today’s small bezels provide bigger screens without increasing the overall size of the monitor.



But if you decide on a 27in or larger screen, go for Quad HD resolution instead of Full HD … or sit further away from the screen.

Most flat screens have a refresh rate of 60Hz, which is fine for most purposes. Doubling it to 120Hz makes things smoother, but it means your PC has to send the screen twice as many frames per second. A PC that runs a popular game at, say, 88fps isn’t going to make it, even if the monitor can handle it.



It’s clearly better to have a screen with a higher refresh rate, but it doesn’t make much practical difference for people who aren’t gamers.

Obviously, you have to connect the screen to your PC, and there are lots of ways to do that. The main ones for your purposes are VGA, DVI, DisplayPort and HDMI. Check your PC to see which ones you can use.



You’re unlikely to need VGA or DVI unless you have an old PC. HDMI and, especially, DisplayPort are better options. HDMI came from the TV industry and royalty-free DisplayPort from the PC industry. 



In both cases, the version level can be important.



With HDMI, even version 1.4 – from 2009 – can handle 1440p at 60Hz, which should be enough for your purposes. But it would be better to for look for v2.0 from 2013, if not last year’s v2.1.



With DisplayPort, look for version 1.2 (from 2010) or later. The spec is now up to v1.4, but even the first version (from 2006) supported both Full HD and Quad HD screens at 60Hz.

Monitor manufacturers offer all kinds of features to make products more attractive to some users. Examples include curved screens, built-in speakers, built-in TV decoders, USB ports, and so on. Most of them also increase the price, so don’t buy them if you don’t need them.



Some people prefer monitors with stands that let you raise, lower or tilt the screen easily. There’s also the time-honoured workaround of standing the monitor on a couple of books.



Nvida’s G-Sync and AMD’s Freesync are “adaptive sync technologies” built into some monitors. They make sure your graphics card and monitor refresh at the same time, which can reduce input lag and “screen tearing” (where parts of the image don’t line up correctly). These features are aimed at gamers, but if they don’t cost extra, there’s no harm in having them.

I don’t see or use enough different monitors to provide a reliable guide to the best buys, and impressions based on seeing monitors at press conferences, trade shows and popular retailers could be misleading. Caveat emptor.



However, regular readers will know that I’ve spent a couple of decades using Dell desktop PCs with Dell monitors. They will not be surprised that I like the Dell U2417H UltraSharp monitor, which has tiny bezels, excellent colour and contrast, and a fully adjustable stand.



At £218.40, Dell’s current price busts your budget, but eBuyer sells it for £199.97, and other sources may charge less.



UltraSharp is the top of Dell’s four ranges of monitors, but it sells two dozen Full HD monitors for less than £200, starting with the 22in SE2216H at £99.98. The 21.5in SE2219H is a much newer alternative, available for £99.99 on Amazon, and would probably do all you need. There’s also an S2218H with built-in speakers for £123.61.

Apart from that, I’ve been generally impressed by Asus, Samsung, LG and AOC monitors, which gives you lots of options to look at. 



I’ve previously recommended the 24in Asus VS248HR gaming monitor, which is great value at £110.96. However, the non-gaming 23.8in Asus VZ249HE might be a better pick for your purposes, at £116.28.



If you would like to try a curved screen, the 24in Samsung C24F396 is a great choice at £119, and you can look at one in Currys PC World. The not-curved 24in S24F356 is an attractive alternative at £129. The 22in S22F352 has the sole advantage of being cheap at £83.83.



It’s not what you asked for, but you can actually afford a budget ultrawide monitor, in the form of the LG 25UM58 at £149.97.



Ultrawides have the same pixel height as Full HD screens, but extend the edges to provide a resolution of 2560 x 1080 pixels. This works well if you have a 34in monster of a screen, but I imagine a 25in version would be like looking through a letterbox.

I wouldn’t recommend a 25in ultrawide without seeing one, and I’ve never seen one. The price makes it interesting, but if you can’t afford a 34in version, 29in (£242.23) would be a better bet.

160,Technology,Google Pixel 3 review: raising the bar for the Android experience,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/18/google-pixel-3-review-android-performance-camera-design,2018-10-18T05:00:12Z,"The Pixel 3 is Google’s third stab at making its own top-end phone, attempting to outshine the likes of Apple and Samsung with a terrific camera and a highly polished experience.

The Pixel 3 is the smaller of the two new Google phones, with a 5.5in FHD+ OLED screen that is bright, crisp and vibrant. It is a beautiful display that is a significant step up from last year’s Pixel 2, with wide viewing angles with minimal colour shift.

The Pixel 3 mirrors the design of last year’s Pixel 2 XL with a relatively large chin and forehead containing stereo speakers and various cameras. It’s fairly small by modern standards, making it easy to handle and pocket, similar to the Pixel 2, Apple’s iPhone XS and the Samsung Galaxy S9. It’s also light at 148g compared to the 177g iPhone XS and 168g Galaxy S9, both of which have slightly larger 5.8in screens.

Gone is last year’s coated aluminium back, replaced with two-tone glass. The frosted bit is etched glass, which is super smooth, but is surrounded by polished glass and coated metal sides that aid your grip. The combination feels wonderfully smooth and luxurious in the hand. This is a phone you will want to fondle.

In the centre of the back below the glossy panel is a fingerprint scanner as good last year’s. There are no other biometric security options, such as face unlock, despite the Pixel 3 having two front-facing cameras.

The bottom of the phone has a USB-C port and a sim tray, while the right side volume button is joined by a mint green power button. There’s no headphone socket to be seen, but the camera only sticks out the back less than 1mm.

The Pixel 3 has Qualcomm’s current top-of-the-line processor, the Snapdragon 845, as used in the OnePlus 6 and most other current flagship smartphones, with the exception of the UK versions of Samsung’s S9 and Note 9 and Huawei’s phones, both of which use their own-brand chips.

The Pixel 3 only has 4GB of RAM, compared with 6GB or even 8GB in some top-end Android competitors. While it might lose in a game of Top Trumps, it’s not noticeable in daily use because the Pixel 3 is so buttery smooth in operation, with top-notch gaming performance too.

The whole system, from switching apps to pulling up the camera, has a level of polish only matched by Apple’s iOS on the iPhone XS. It’s not quite as brutally rapid as the OnePlus 6 in operation, simply because the animations play out for longer, but it’s easily faster and slicker than any other Android device.

Battery life for the Pixel 3 is a moving target. Normally smartphones stabilise to a fairly consistent level after a couple of days of first starting them up.

The Pixel 3, however, has been gaining around 10% of battery life each day over the last week, starting with poor 15-hour battery life that wouldn’t get through to bedtime. A couple of days later it scrapes through 24 hours, meaning it would make it from one morning alarm to the next without charging after a week of testing – the bare minimum that is acceptable in 2018.

That was with consistent use as my primary device sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music with Spotify on Bluetooth headphones, watching 30 minutes of Netflix and shooting about 10 photos a day.

Part of that is undoubtedly down to the Adaptive Battery technology in Android 9 Pie that learns your usage pattern and limits power to apps you don’t really use. It’s possible that over the next couple of weeks battery life may continue to improve, although it is unlikely to be by vast amounts.

A full charge via the included 18w fast charger took 101 minutes. The Pixel 3 can also charge wirelessly at up to 10w, which is a little slower than via cable but still faster than some phones charge from their bundled chargers.

The Pixel 3 runs the latest version of Android 9 Pie, which makes it one of only handful of phones to do so.

The main advantages of Pie over previous versions are better notification handling, particularly around do not disturb (DND) modes, wellbeing tool integration for tracking usage and modes to deter usage, such as Wind Down, and great integration of AI systems.

Exclusive to the Pixel 3 is Google’s smart compose for Gmail, which takes the advanced autocomplete you might have used in Gmail in the browser on desktop to the Gmail app on the phone. It’s scarily good at writing emails.

Google has also removed the traditional home and overview navigation buttons, replacing them by a pill-shaped gesture button in the middle and a small back arrow to the left.

The back button still does what you’d expect, but the gesture button does a number of things. Tap it to go home, tap and hold to invoke Google Assistant, flick it upwards once to get to the app switcher or twice to get to the app drawer (you can also go straight to the app drawer by dragging it further up the screen).

Dragging the gesture button to the right turns it into a slider flicking between recently used apps as you move your finger across the bar. Flicking the button to the right switches straight to the last used app in the same way a double-tap on the overview button used to.

It works fine, but there is a bit of getting used to and I don’t think it’s actually faster than the previous navigation buttons. It also isn’t as smooth and intuitive as Apple’s gesture bar system introduced with the iPhone X, or some other gesture systems used by the likes of OnePlus or Huawei.

It is safe to say the Pixel 3 has one of the best, if not the best cameras available today.

The rear 12-megapixel camera is capable of capturing stunning images, rich in detail, vibrancy and dynamic range. It is better than any other at bringing out detail and colour from high-contrast scenes where there are a mix of bright lights and dark corners thanks to Google’s HDR+ algorithms.

Low light performance is also fantastic, and that’s before the promised Night Sight mode that will come in a software update soon, which Google says will be able to produce dramatically better night-time shots.

What sets the Pixel 3 apart from the competition is that it can do all this with practically no user skill whatsoever – this is the point-and-shoot that will make you look like you know what you’re doing even if you don’t.

Google’s Top Shot works as advertised, using on-device AI to discern if one of the many frames it captures before and after you hit the shutter button is better than your attempt, for when someone blinks or cuts across your field of view.

Likewise, Super Res Zoom is far better than standard digital zoom, but can’t quite match the clarity of Apple’s hybrid zoom using the iPhone XS’s 2x telephoto lens at extended zooms.

Two selfie cameras adorn the front: a standard 8-megapixel camera joined but a wide-angle fixed focus camera allowing you to zoom out one step. At normal zoom levels the camera captures a stunning amount of detail even in crummy lighting conditions – if you have flaws in your skin this camera will capture them in all their glory.

The wide-angle selfie helps you fit more people in, but the images it captured aren’t quite as good.

Portrait mode for both front and rear cameras has been improved, particularly around hair, and now with the ability adjust blur both in the background and foreground after the fact. The motion autofocus is also magic, making macro shots a lot easier – tap on an object and the focus follows it around.
• None In the box you get a set of USB-C earphones, which behave much like Google’s PixelBuds, and a USB-C to 3.5mm converter for your own headphones
• None The speakers are really quite loud and clear with no noticeable distortion even at maximum volume and pretty good stereo separation
• None You can turn the screen face down to switch on do not disturb
• None Haptic feedback is the best yet on an Android phone, with short, sharp and punchy vibrations, although still not quite on-par with Apple’s brilliant Taptic Engine in its devices
• None The phone has an e-sim, which will be activated through a software update later this year with EE confirmed to support it
• None You can squeeze the sides to trigger Google Assistant
• None Google sells a wireless charging stand called the Pixel Stand that turns the phone into a Google Assistant smart display

The Google Pixel 3 is available for £739 with 64GB of storage or £839 with 128GB of storage, in a choice of black, white or pink.

For comparison, the 64GB Pixel 3 XL costs £869, the Huawei P20 Pro costs £669, the Samsung Galaxy S9 costs £639, the OnePlus 6 costs £469 and the 64GB iPhone XS costs £999.

The Pixel 3 can be summed up in one word: refinement.

Every element of Android 9 Pie is slick and responsive. It’s simple to use but powerful in its execution. From the simply brilliant camera to the auto-complete in Gmail, on-device AI proves truly useful. Plus you get at least three years of software updates, which is still a rarity outside of Apple’s iPhone.

The outside of the phone feels luxurious, but in a different way to the iPhone XS. The way the etched glass blends into the polished glass and body looks and feels beautiful.

Inside and out the Pixel 3 is more polished than any other Android smartphone, fully justifying Google’s entry into the big leagues.

It’s not perfect, of course; the battery life could certainly do with being longer, and a glass back will be less durable than metal. There’s also no face unlocking and the relatively large chin and forehead will look dated in a year or so.

But there’s absolutely no doubt that if you don’t want a £999 iPhone XS, the Pixel 3 is the best small smartphone going.

161,Technology,Huawei Mate 20 Pro launches with in-screen fingerprint sensor,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/16/huawei-mate-20-pro-launches-in-screen-fingerprint-sensor,2018-10-16T13:30:14Z,"Huawei’s new Mate 20 Pro has a massive screen, three cameras on the back and a fingerprint scanner embedded in the display.

The new top-end phone from the Chinese firm aims to secure its place at the top of the market alongside Samsung, having recently beaten Apple to become the second-largest smartphone manufacturer in August.

The Mate 20 Pro follows Huawei’s tried and trusted format for its Mate series: a huge 6.39in QHD+ OLED screen, big 4,200mAh battery and powerful new Huawei Kirin 980 processor – Huawei’s first to be produced at 7 nanometres, matching Apple’s latest A12 chip in the 2018 iPhones.

New for this year is an infrared 3D facial recognition system, similar to that used by Apple for its Face ID in the iPhone XS, and one of the first fingerprint scanners embedded in the screen that is widely available in the UK, removing the need for a fingerprint scanner on the back or a chin on the front.

The Mate 20 Pro is water resistant to IP68 standards and has a sleek new design reminiscent of Samsung’s S-series phones, with curved glass on the front and back. The back also has an new pattern etched into the glass, which is smooth to the touch but ridged when running your nail over it.

“The hyper-optical pattern reduces smudging, is a little grippier than normal smooth glass so it’s less slippery in the hand, and it looks great,” said Peter Gauden, global senior product marketing manager for Huawei.

On the back is a new version of Huawei’s award-winning triple camera system using a 40-megapixel standard camera, an 8-megapixel telephoto camera with a 3x optical zoom and new for this year is a 20-megapixel ultra-wide angle camera, replacing the monochrome sensor used on the P20 Pro.

“The monochrome lens from last year was barely used, so we switched it out for the wide-angle camera,” Gauden said. “Now you can take really epic wide-angle shots, with the camera automatically zooming in or out on the fly, recognising when you’re trying to take a photo of a cat or dog, or something that would aesthetically benefit from a wider shot, or you can manually press the zoom button to switch.”

The Mate 20 Pro will also be the first Huawei phone with the company’s latest EMUI 9, based on Android 9 Pie, which it said has been optimised to significantly speed up regular tasks.

Huawei said that compared to the Mate 10 running EMUI 8, the new Mate 20 Pro will be able to launch apps 51% faster, responds to taps 47% faster and is smoother in operation throughout. The company also said that in its testing the Mate 20 Pro launched apps as much as 400 milliseconds faster than its chief rival Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9, starting Chrome 43% faster, Google Maps 27% faster and Facebook 25% faster.

Alongside the Mate 20 Pro, Huawei also launched a cheaper Mate 20 without the face recognition or embedded fingerprint scanner, and a new fitness-focused smartwatch using its own-brand LiteOS called the Huawei Watch GT.

“These new devices will be of great concern to rival smartphone makers,” said Ben Wood, chief of research for CCS Insight. “The Huawei P20 devices (P20 Pro, P20 and P20 Lite) have already grabbed substantial share in key markets such as Europe and Asia/Pacific and have only been prevented from securing share in the US because of the ban on Huawei products that occurred in January 2018.”

Wood said that Huawei had shipped 95m smartphones in the first six months of 2018 accounting for a 30% year-on-year growth.

“We believe camera capabilities will emerge as the star feature on these new devices, in particular the Mate 20 Pro. If it can replicate the performance of the P20 Pro it will further underline Huawei’s growing status as smartphone camera maker,” Wood said.",0.9893,
162,Technology,Google launches Pixel 3 smartphones and Pixel Slate tablet,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/09/google-launches-pixel-3-smartphones-super-res-zoom-top-shot-pixel-slate-samsung-apple,2018-10-09T16:00:22Z,"Google’s new Pixel 3 smartphones attempt to push the computational photography envelope, challenging Apple’s new iPhone XS and Samsung’s Galaxy S9.

As with last year’s Pixel 2, Google is further flexing its artificial-intelligence muscle, with more and more local AI-driven features across every facet of the device, from the camera and smart Gmail replies to battery life and device control.

“We’ve been very thoughtful about how we design phones, thinking about their purpose for consumers,” said Mario Queiroz, head of Google’s Pixel. “We want to make sure we have a the right balance between being really helpful but not intrusive, being delightful but not controlling, simple but not cumbersome.”

The Pixel devices look familiar on the outside, with a two-tone back that is now all glass with two finishes – polished at the top and etched at the bottom. Both devices come with increased screen sizes and IP68 water resistance.

The Pixel 3 adopts the design of the Pixel 2 XL but shrunk from 6in to 5.5in diagonally, a gain of 0.5in in screen size over last year’s Pixel 2. The Pixel 3 XL stretches the display to 6.3in diagonally, adopting the on-trend screen notch and resembling the OnePlus 6 in the process.

Both devices have similar body dimensions to their predecessors, along with front-facing stereo speakers, a fingerprint scanner on the back and now 10W wireless charging.

They both share the same top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, a choice of 64GB or 128GB of storage, 4GB of memory, new Titan M security chip and cameras, making screen size the big differentiator.

The Pixel 3 smartphones also now have a dual selfie cameras on the front consisting of one standard and one wide-angle, which are used to enable wide-angle group selfies and zooming. Google said its custom Pixel Visual Core AI chip can correct the distortion caused by a wide-angle lens on the fly, while its Photobooth mode can be left to continue capturing photos when faces are detected and people smile.

The rear camera on the back remains a solo 12-megapixel system, but gains several AI-powered features on top of the existing HDR+ system that has proven effective at capturing images with excellent detail, contrast and dynamic range in challenging lighting conditions.

The first is a feature called Top Shot, which shoots lots of HDR+ shots before and after you hit the shutter button. The system then suggests a superior shot if your intended photo isn’t the best of the batch using on-device machine learning to identify things such as hair covering the face or unintentional blinks.

The rear camera also has a new system Google calls Super Res Zoom, which compensates for the lack of an optical zoom by using a computational photography technique typically used in satellite imagery. Harnessing the natural shake of the human hand when a photo is captured, or simulated oscillation if tripod-mounted, the camera shoots lots of images at subtly different angles blending them together to add detail to the image as you zoom in. The effect is a vastly improved digital zoom that Google says rivals the best optical zoom on any smartphone.

Google is also introducing a computational photography technique called Night Sight, which can capture natural-looking photos in the dark without a flash and will be rolling out as part of a software update later this year.

The Pixel 3 is also the first smartphone to build in Lens directly into the main camera view, and not as a separate mode; Google’s machine vision-powered search system recognises objects, text, business cards, QR codes and other things. Google’s AR Playground also gains more interactive stickers and contextual suggestions that react live to things such as facial expressions in the camera app.

The Pixel 3 will also be the first to introduce Gmail smart compose features to the mobile app and a new Shush Mode that enables Do No Disturb when the phone is placed screen-side down, alongside Google’s existing digital wellness controls to prevent smartphone addiction and machine-learning systems for brightness control and battery life preservation.

With the Pixel 3, Google is also launching a wireless-charging accessory called the Pixel Stand that turns the smartphone into a Google Assistant smart display, capable of pulling duty as a Google Home with a screen.

Features include a sunrise mode that will light the room with warming colours immediately prior to a wake up alarm, a digital photo-frame mode and compatibility with Google’s Nest cameras.

Both phones will be available in three colours: black,white and pink. The Pixel 3 will cost £739 with 64GB and £839 with 128GB of storage. The Pixel 3 XL will cost £869 with 64GB and £969 with 128GB of storage.

Alongside the Pixel 3 smartphones, Google also unveiled a new Chrome OS tablet called the Pixel Slate, which can be paired with the Pixel Slate Keyboard to create detachable laptop with a full trackpad, following on from last year’s high-end Pixelbook 2-in-1.

The Pixel Slate has a high-resolution display with a screen density of 293 pixels per inch, similar to some smartphones, and dual front-facing speakers. There’s a fingerprint scanner embedded within the power button, while the backlit keyboard attaches magnetically to the bottom of the tablet, closing over the screen to create a case similar to designs used by Samsung’s PC tablets.

Trond Wuellner, product director for Google’s computing hardware, said: “The Pixel Slate provides a full desktop experience, not one designed for a phone, including full power Linux applications.”

After the demise of Android-based tablets from all but budget media consumption devices, Google will hope its Pixel Slate can challenge both Apple’s iPad Pro and Microsoft’s Surface range of detachable Windows 10 machines including the recent lower-cost Surface Go.

The Pixel Slate will cost $599 when it is launched in the US later this year, with the keyboard costing $199 and a stylus $99.

Google also unveiled a revamped version of its Chromecast streaming stick, and a new Google Assistant-powered smart display called the Google Home Hub, which competes directly with Amazon’s Echo Show alongside Google Assistant smart displays from Lenovo, Harman and LG.

The Home Hub has a screen and microphone, but does not have a camera, unlike most rivals. Diya Jolly, Google’s vice president of product management for Home and Nest said: “We consciously did not put a camera on the hub so that you’re comfortable putting Hub in the private spaces of your home like the bedroom.”

The smart display will have customised versions of Google’s search, Maps, YouTube, Calendar and Photos. It will also have a new smart home management system called Home View aimed at simplifying the controls of lights, thermostats and other devices.

The Google Home Hub will cost $149 in the US, available for pre-order from today.",0.9991,
163,Australia news,Former Sydney Opera House boss attacks 'offensive' ad for 'shoddy horse race',https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/08/former-sydney-opera-house-boss-offensive-ad-horse-race,2018-10-08T00:27:36Z,"The former chief executive of the Opera House has described the decision to allow the promotion of a horse race on the sails of the building as “crass, inappropriate and offensive”.

“I find it extraordinary that the state politicians on both sides have somehow decided that this is in the interests of Sydney, New South Wales or Australia to corrupt the way the Opera House works, to corrupt art integrity of the building and to be able to use it in any way a politician wants,” Michael Lynch told ABC radio on Monday. Lynch ran the Opera House from 1998 to 2002.

“I would not regard myself as precious or elitist and I just find the lily-livered approach by the politicians on this issue [and] the nexus between the gambling bodies and the politicians seriously disturbing.”

The NSW government’s decision on Friday night to order the Opera House to accept an application from Racing NSW came after a public campaign by the rightwing broadcaster Alan Jones and despite Opera House management saying the proposal contravened a policy to prevent the building’s commercialisation.

It has prompted an outcry amid concerns about the use of the building – a petition opposing the decision had reached 170,000 signatures on Monday afternoon.

On Monday afternoon the National Trust NSW conservation director, Graham Quint, said he believed projecting commercial material onto the sails contravened state laws.

“They’ve gone with a decision that we think probably is not legal,” Quint told AAP. “It may be in breach of the Heritage Act.”

Quint said the legislation made clear that projecting colours and images onto the sails should be “confined to exceptional, non-commercial occasions of brief duration”.

Racing NSW’s board held an urgent meeting on Monday after receiving what were described as “threats” that raised serious security concerns for Tuesday’s proposed event to announce the barrier draw for the Everest Cup.

A spokesman declined to elaborate on what sort of threats, but said Racing NSW, as the sport’s administrator, was taking them seriously and deciding what to do.



The racing organisation had planned to hold a high-profile event to be attended by racing figures and politicians. It was believed to be scheduled to be held at the Opera House, where, at the same time, the barrier draw was to be projected on to the sails of the building.



Racing NSW is attempting to turn the Everest Cup, which has the world’s highest prize pool of $13m, into an event that will rival the Melbourne Cup on the international racing calendar. But the furore over whether it constitutes commercial exploitation of the Opera House or legitimate promotion of an event has marred the lead-up to the event.

The head of the Opera House, Louise Herron, has said the proposal risked the building’s world heritage listing. A spokesman for Unesco told the Guardian: “The World Heritage Centre is looking into this and will not comment before it finds out all the details.”

On Monday the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, stood by the decision, saying the government “would never support anything we though diminished the iconic statute of the Opera House”.

“I am pleased the version we have landed on is a big compromise and it is different to what the government was presented with earlier on,” she said.

“I want to state at the outset it is very good to have these great debates about what is important [but] I am incredibly comfortable with the decision we have landed at. All sides of politics support the decision and we are proceeding with it on that basis.”

But Lynch said using the Opera House to “flog some shoddy horse race” was a contravention of the government’s responsibilities.

“It’s similar to the idea of suddenly putting ads over all the ABC venues,” he said.

“It’s just not the way you run a building that has been world heritage listed. It took us over 20 years to secure that world heritage listing. There are conditions and legal restrictions that the NSW government as owner of the site have entered into and now they’ve just said we don’t care about that, we’re not going to do that any more.”

In a widely criticised interview on Friday, Jones berated Herron, saying “Who the hell do you think ... who do you think you are?”

On Monday he went further, describing Herron as a “tyrant” and accusing her of double standards for opposing the advertisement because the building had already been commercialised via a Samsung partnership in 2013.

“Many people have had problems with the same lady in the past. I won’t go into those problems now. But plenty of correspondence [sic] has talked to me about her being a tyrant,” he said.

“Well done, Louise, have you told your leftwing mates that no one has commercialised the Opera House more than you? What’s the issue with the Everest?”

Over the weekend the prime minister, Scott Morrison, backed the decision to allow advertising for the race, calling it “commonsense” and said he did not understand “why people are getting so precious about it”.

“This is one of the biggest events of the year,” he said. “Why not put it on the biggest billboard Sydney has?”

The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, criticised Morrison’s description on Monday, but declined to answer directly whether he agreed with the decision to allow advertising.

“I don’t think most Australians, when they think about the Opera House, think of it as a billboard,” Shorten said. “To me, the Opera House is a representation of Australia’s capacity to build splendid things. Unlike prime minister Morrison, I don’t look at the Opera House and see a billboard, I see a remarkable Australian achievement.”

“I think he should be preparing himself to go back to a job in tourism driving a bus post the next election, because I don’t think its appropriate that the prime minister interferes into a state-owned organisation.”

Morrison was the managing director of Tourism Australia before going into politics.",0.9831,
164,World news,Former South Korean president jailed for 15 years for corruption,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/05/south-korean-president-jailed-15-years-corruption-lee-myung-bak,2018-10-05T08:34:58Z,"The former South Korean president Lee Myung-bak has been sentenced to 15 years in prison, becoming the country’s fourth ex-leader convicted of corruption.

He was also fined 13bn won (£8.8m) after Seoul Central district court found him guilty of bribery and embezzlement.

Lee served as president from 2008-13 and his conviction follows the jailing in April of his successor, Park Geun-hye, dealing a serious blow to conservatives in South Korea. Park is serving a 33-year sentence for corruption and was forced from office amid large-scale protests.

The 76-year-old did not attend Friday’s hearing as a protest against it being televised live. He has consistently denied the charges and said the proceedings were politically motivated. Prosecutors had sought a 20-year jail term.

The court ruled that Lee had accepted bribes from some of South Korea’s largest companies, including Samsung, and the country’s intelligence service. He was found to have embezzled about 24bn won through slush funds at an auto parts company called DAS. Lee claimed the firm belonged to his brother but the court ruled that he was the de-facto owner. “Bringing everything into consideration, heavy punishment for the accused is inevitable,” the court said.

South Korean politicians are often scrutinised for their cozy relationship with the country’s family-owned conglomerates, or chaebol, which control vast swaths of the economy. It has led to frequent accusations of criminality across the political spectrum.

During the trial, Samsung was found to have paid Lee about 6bn won in exchange for a presidential pardon for its chair, Lee Kun-hee, who was jailed for tax evasion.

The court also said it was wrong for Lee to continue to deny the charges against him, and admonished him for attempting to shift the blame on to subordinates. The former South Korean leader was indicted in April on 16 charges that included bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.

Lee previously described the case against him as “revenge” after the liberal president Moon Jae-in, currently in office, was elected. Moon was chief of staff under Roh Moo-hyun, who served as president from 2003 to 2008 and killed himself in 2009 after he was questioned by prosecutors about alleged corruption during Lee’s tenure. Moon has accused Lee of targeting Roh in an effort to discredit liberal politicians.

Chun Doo-hwan, the president from 1980-88, and Roh Tae-woo, the president from 1988-1993, were convicted of bribery and sedition in 1996 but were pardoned a year later.",-0.9925,
165,Technology,"Apple iPhone XS review: two steps forward, one step back",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/04/apple-iphone-xs-review-battery-life-camera-design-performance,2018-10-04T05:00:16Z,"The iPhone XS hasn’t broken mould like the iPhone X, and it has weaker battery life, but its camera, design and performance are class-leading

The iPhone XS isn’t the only all-screen iPhone on the block this year, but with its balance of large screen and small body, is it still the iPhone to buy?

To say that the iPhone XS looks exactly the same as the iPhone X is somewhat of an understatement. Apart from a pair of new antenna lines and asymmetric holes in the bottom, the phone is an identical metal and glass sandwich. Unless you buy the new gold colour.

Fortunately that’s not a bad thing this generation, as it maintains everything that made last year’s iPhone X so good. That includes the large screen squeezed into a small body, the luxurious feel and top-notch new design that ditched the home button.

The 5.8in OLED screen is one of the best ever fitted to a smartphone and makes watching movies and TV shows on the commute a joy. The speakers are now louder, but there’s still no headphone jack nor a lightning to 3.5mm adapter in the box this time round.

Weighing 177g, the iPhone XS is 3g heavier than the phone it replaces, 3g lighter than the Huawei P20 Pro but 14g heavier than the Samsung Galaxy S9. It’s also thinner than most at 7.7mm thick. All of which is to say it’s easy to pocket and handle, with either one or two hands.

The iPhone XS has the same internals as its bigger sibling, the XS Max, and unsurprisingly performs exactly the same. With the six-core A12 Bionic the phone is responsive, smooth and likely has more raw power than most will need, until some magical new app comes along to take advantage of it.

Game performance is also excellent, while the improved AI processor speeds up AR experiences and other machine-learning systems.

Unfortunately, like the iPhone XS Max, the iPhone XS marks a step backwards in terms of battery life for Apple. Where the iPhone X lasted 30 hours between charges, the iPhone XS only just scrapes 24 hours.

That means if I take it off the charger at 7am on day one, it’ll only just make it to my alarm at 7am the next day without being plugged in, meaning you will definitely need to fully charge it at least once a day. On heavy days it would be on its knees as I made it to bed.

That was while using it as my primary device sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.

A full-day’s battery is the bare minimum that’s acceptable in 2018, and competitors can last closer to double that.

While there are many factors that affect battery life, it’s worth noting that the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max were affected to a greater extent by cellular network congestion, such as that experienced on commuter trains and in packed stations, than competitors.

Both phones bounced around between Edge, 3G and 4G more often than the iPhone X, Google’s Pixel 2 XL and a OnePlus 6, and even with full 4G signal the iPhones struggled to pull down data and got hotter where the competitors still managed to load sites and emails, albeit slowly.

The iPhone XS runs iOS 12 out of the box, which is a refinement of last year’s iOS 11 rather than a massive shakeup. It still has the same problems of status icons being lost because of the notch in the screen, but it has made big improvements with grouped notification handling and now has integrated wellbeing tools so you can keep an eye on your smartphone usage.

Apple has also added a prominent banner on the lock screen when you have Do Not Disturb active, which makes it much harder to forget to deactivate it when you wake up.

Face ID returns as Apple’s only biometric option on the iPhone XS. It works just as well as it did last year, identifying me without fault, unveiling my notifications and unlocking the phone.

It can have problems with certain sunglasses, and it would also be nice to have the option of using my fingerprint to unlock or pay for things.

The iPhone XS has the same camera system as fitted to the XS Max – two 12-megapixel cameras on the back, one with a wide-angle lens and the other a 2x telephoto lens.

New for this year is better detail capture, particularly when images are viewed at full resolution, and better low light performance. But it is Apple’s improved “Smart HDR” function that is most noticeable, making images with extremes of contrast such as those shot into the sun much more usable.

The portrait mode has also been improved, now with the ability to adjust the level of background blur after capture, which is fun.

The selfie camera is good, but not quite the best on the market for preserving skin detail. Some have complained that it smooths skin and makes them look orange, but that’s not something I could see in photos.
• None The camera lump sticks out the back, making it wobble around when being used on a desk
• None You can swipe across the gesture bar to jump to the previously used app
• None You need a USB-C to Lightning cable to fast charge the phone, but neither it nor a compatible charger are included in the box
• None The iPhone XS is water resistant to IP68 standards, which is a higher rating than last year’s iPhones
• None Wireless charging is great, but the iPhone heats up quite a lot while charging, more so than competitor phones
• None This iPhone XS, bought from Apple’s online store, charges just fine with the screen on or off

The iPhone XS comes in your choice of black, silver or gold, costing £999 for 64GB of storage, £1,149 for 256GB or £1,349 for 512GB.

For comparison, the iPhone XS Max starts at £1,099, the Huawei P20 Pro costs £669, the Samsung Galaxy S9 costs £639 and the OnePlus 6 costs £469.

The 6.1in iPhone XR will be released in October costing £749 for £64GB of storage.

The iPhone X set a new bar for what an iPhone could be. It was a massive step forward for Apple and put it ahead of many competitors in smartphone design and function.

The iPhone XS maintains the forward-looking design and function, feeling wonderful in the hand, has a noticeably better camera and is still arguably the best phone on the market right now at balancing screen size with usability.

But it’s certainly not perfect, with weaker battery life than last year and a still eye-watering price. With the cheaper 6.1in iPhone XR around the corner, it might be worth waiting to see what it’s like before shelling out £999, but the iPhone XS is still great.

166,Technology,"Apple, Google and Amazon named as most valuable brands in world",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/04/apple-google-and-amazon-named-as-most-valuable-brands-in-world,2018-10-03T23:01:07Z,"Apple, Google and Amazon are the top three most valuable brands in the world, according to an annual report that underlines the dominance of the US tech companies.

Interbrand, which assigns a dollar value to each brand based on factors such as financial performance and brand strength, ranked Apple first in 2018 with a brand value of $214bn. In August, Apple became the first public company with a trillion dollar valuation.

Apple and Google have held the top two spots for six consecutive years, according to Interbrand’s Best Global Brands report, while Facebook slipped one place in 2018 to ninth after being the fastest growing brand for five years.

Meanwhile brands that made the top 100 in 2017 but were ejected this year included Tesla, Thomson Reuters, Moët & Chandon, and Smirnoff.

Charles Trevail, chief executive of Interbrand, said those brands that were able to respond to the changing needs and expectations of customers were the most successful. “Today we live in a world where consumers have more power than ever, curating their own personal brands in ways we’ve never seen. Brands like Amazon, Spotify and Netflix lead the way in this era by improving our lives in very personal ways.”

Netflix was the only one of the so-called Faang stocks – Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google – to be outside the top 10, but it is the second fastest growing brand in 2018 after making its debut in the top 100 in 2017.

“[Netflix’s] brave decision to invest in original programming in 2012 has now netted it a staggering 112 Emmy nominations, more than any network or streaming service, and its stock market value is greater than Disney,” Interbrand said.

Amazon was the fastest growing brand, because of its desire to be “the most customer-centric company on Earth”, the report added. “It has reinvented almost every sector … It revamped its Fire Phone to become the Amazon Echo smart speaker, Amazon MP3 to become streaming music service Amazon Music Unlimited, and its 2010 crowdsourcing platform for screenwriters into Amazon Studios’ Emmy Award–winning original TV shows. What’s more, according to Morgan Stanley, Amazon’s fashion business has become the second largest seller of apparel in the US.”

New entrants in the top 100 were the music streaming service Spotify, at No 92, and Subaru at 100. Re-entrants include Chanel at 23 and Nintendo at 99.

More than half of the top 100 came from five sectors – automotive, technology, financial services, luxury, and fast-moving consumer goods.

Luxury was the top performing category, with combined growth of 42%. The most valuable luxury brand in the 2018 rankings was Louis Vuitton, ranked 18 with a value of $28bn.

The most valuable British brand was HSBC, ranked 46, with a brand valued at $11bn.

Interbrand said many of the top performers were subscription based businesses, accounting for 29% of the top 100 brands. “This is because traditional notions of loyalty are eroding as we live in a service-driven economy where access is more important than ownership,” the report said.

The combined value of the top 100 was just over $2tn, according to Interbrand, up nearly 7% from 2017.",0.9982,
167,Technology,Should I buy a PC with Intel Optane drive acceleration?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2018/sep/27/should-i-buy-a-pc-with-intel-optane-drive-acceleration,2018-09-27T11:04:28Z,"The difference between the two PCs boils down to how much storage you need and the performance of the Optane accelerator in the Intel-based machine.

Most buyers have to choose between expensive but fast SSDs (solid-state drives) and cheaper, slower but much larger HDDs (hard disk drives). I answered this question in June (What is the best laptop drive for students?), providing some background on the different technologies used.

Reading it now might help, but to summarise, the best answer for most laptop users is an SSD. Ideally, it should be an M.2 module with NVM Express (NVMe) drivers and controllers, rather than the traditional SSD that fits into a standard drive bay and uses a SATA connection. However, any SSD will do the job well.

Desktop PC users have other options, with Optane accelerators being one of the most cost-effective. I use one myself.

Basically, Optane provides a high-speed cache between the processor and the HDD. This increases the responsiveness of your PC, giving you close to SSD speeds at HDD prices.

Desktop PC users typically want to have masses of data readily available, including decades-worth of documents, photos, music and video files. These won’t fit on an affordable SSD, so desktops often have 1TB or larger HDDs.

If you have too much data for an SSD, one option is to fit a second internal hard drive, so make sure the PC you buy has at least one empty drive bay. You can also store data and backups on external hard drives or online, but both are much slower than using an internal drive.

The other option is to add an Optane cache to accelerate a traditional hard drive. There are some limitations, but in general, this should outperform a SATA-style SSD in a drive bay. You can get the best of both worlds.

Optane is a new type of memory chip developed in secret by Intel and Micron in a partnership that will end next year. They call the technology 3D XPoint (cross point). It might be an example of ReRAM (resistive random-access memory), but don’t quote me on that. It’s certainly different.

3D XPoint chips fit into the gap between standard memory chips (RAM) and the Flash memory chips used in SSDs. 3D XPoint chips are slower and cheaper than RAM chips, but dramatically faster and costlier than SSD chips.

Over the long term, more advanced 3D XPoint chips will replace RAM chips for some purposes (Intel has already announced 512GB memory modules) and Flash chips for other purposes.

Intel sells 3D XPoint devices under the Optane brand label while Micron uses QuantX.

Intel has taken the lead partly because it can manufacture processors, support chips and motherboards that work with Optane. Specifically, Optane requires a seventh- or eighth-generation Intel Core processor, a motherboard with recent Intel support chips (eg Z270 or Z250), Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) V15.5 or later drivers, and a GPT formatted hard drive, not MBR (PDF).

The latest version of Optane works with secondary hard drives, not just 64-bit Windows 10 boot drives. This is a useful step forward. Unfortunately, it requires an eighth-generation Core processor and a motherboard with Intel Series 300 or later support chips.

You can buy Optane accelerators and SSDs in the usual places, but getting them to work properly can be another matter. Even if you have a compatible PC, you may need to update the BIOS/UEFI firmware and download new drivers. It’s simpler to buy a new desktop PC with Optane pre-installed.

However, people who need the maximum performance from their PCs could think about buying an Optane SSD. Intel’s 280GB Optane 900P SSD sells for around £360 and outperforms other M2 SSDs by a significant margin. It should also last much longer. Sadly, it’s more than four times the price of a 250GB Samsung M2 SSD (around £80), and nine times the price of a 240GB SanDisk SATA SSD (around £40).

Given the price of Optane SSDs, most users will settle for 16GB or 32GB M.2 modules installed as caches, using the Intel management software supplied. The first time you run a program or load data, you won’t see any difference. Loading programs again is extremely fast, because they are being loaded from the Optane cache.

In my experience with a 1TB hard drive and a 16GB Optane cache, performance is comparable with a traditional SATA SSD and approaching that of an M.2 SSD, for most normal purposes.

Optane chips are “non-volatile” so, unlike RAM chips, they remember whatever they are storing even if you turn the power off.

You don’t have to worry about which programs and data are cached because the software manages that automatically.

However, you may have problems if you run so many different programs that they won’t fit into the cache available. Someone who runs a lot of multi-level AAA games might well be in that position. Someone who regularly throws 16GB data files around may not see many benefits from Optane, and may suffer slowdowns due to cache swapping.

Your use sounds much like mine. I typically run two browsers with around 50 to 250 tabs and one or two Microsoft Office programs, which are lightweights by today’s standards. I also do some photo and video editing. Given my predictable usage, Optane works very well. If I did run into problems, I think I could solve them by swapping the 16GB module for a 32GB version.

However, someone who uses very large programs and/or large data files might well be better off with a 256GB or larger SSD than a cached hard drive. Also, the more unpredictable you are, the worse it is for any cache.

The most cost-effective compromise might be a SATA SSD for the boot disk with an Optane-accelerated secondary HDD. Please comment below if you’ve done that.

I admit to being sceptical about Optane memory before I tried it. It wasn’t on my list as a required specification. It just happened to be included in a Dell XPS Core i5-8400/8GB PC that had the specs I wanted at an attractive price (£699), and I assumed it couldn’t do any harm.

If it didn’t work well, I could always install a cheap SSD and use the built-in HDD as a secondary drive. (Yes, Optane will speed up an SSD!)

Having used it for 10 months without running into any problems, I can recommend it. However, I haven’t done any serious speed tests. Others have.

For example, TweakTown has tested a 32GB Optane cache in great depth, while AnandTech has tested this year’s 64GB module. Both make useful comments.

TweakTown and Tom’s Hardware reinforce the point that we don’t spend much time copying sequential files, which is how people often test drive speeds. Most of the time, we’re doing random-access reads. That is where SSDs are at their weakest, and Optane is at its strongest.

168,Technology,iPhone XS Max review: Apple's supersized smartphone,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/27/iphone-xs-max-review-apple-supersized-smartphone,2018-09-27T05:00:14Z,"Its massive screen is beautiful, but has it lost some of the charm that made the iPhone X so good?

Apple’s top of the line smartphone has been supersized in both screen size and price, but is the iPhone XS Max really worth the eye-watering £1,099-plus asking price?

Last year’s iPhone X was a massive leap forward in design for Apple after years of resting on its laurels. This year the iPhone XS Max is essentially that winning design stuck in a photocopier on 112%, which doesn’t sound a lot but makes quite a difference.

The iPhone XS Max is all about its massive, beautiful screen, which iseasily better than any other, apart from Samsung’s top-of-the-line displays. At 6.5in diagonally the screen is essentially the same size as that on Samsung’s monster-phone the Galaxy Note 9, which has a 6.4in display but with a different width to length ratio. Both are high-end phones with around 103cm2 of screen area and a screen-to-body ratio of around 84%, and as such dwarf the competition.

Apple’s biggest achievement is that the colossal screen has been squeezed into a body that isn’t that enormous. The iPhone XS Max is certainly a big phone, but at 7.7mm thick it’s thinner than all of the current top-end phones, including the 8.8mm thick Samsung Galaxy Note 9.

At 157.5mm long the iPhone XS Max is also shorter than even phones with much smaller screens such as the 6in Google Pixel 2 XL (157.9mm long), the 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S9+ (158.1mm long) and is a full 4.4mm shorter than the Note 9.

The thing is the iPhone XS Max is actually one of the more difficult super-sized phones to handle. That’s partly because it’s marginally wider than the competition at 77.4mm wide, which is 1mm wider than the Note 9 and a full 3.6mm wider than the S9+. But the biggest difference between the iPhone and the rest is Apple’s use of rounded sides.

Yes, they look and feel luxurious in stainless steel, but they’re difficult to get a solid grip on with your fingers. Others taper to an edge of some sort along the sides, which gives your fingers purchase.

Unless you have abnormally large hands, the iPhone XS Max is therefore almost exclusively a two-handed phone, even with Apple’s reachability, which brings the top of the screen down to the middle – try and use it with one hand at your peril, as this metal and glass sandwich will smash if you drop it.

All-day battery, but nowhere near two

The iPhone XS Max has Apple’s latest processor, the six-core A12 Bionic, which the company says is 15% faster than last year’s A11 Bionic and up to 50% more efficient. But it is the integrated AI chip that is up to nine times faster than the old one that apparently makes all the difference.

In day-to-day operation it’s not noticeably faster than the iPhone X, which already feels snappy and responsive with iOS 12. But as with other recent iPhone upgrades, the raw power will only likely come into its own with new software, speeding up AR experiences and other bits and pieces behind the scenes.

The battery life of the iPhone XS Max was slightly disappointing. It will get through the daylight hours without issue, but it won’t rival the Huaweis of this world. It lasted just over 27 hours between charges, starting at 7am on day one and lasting right through till past 10am on day two.

That was while using it as my primary device sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix and shooting around 10 or so photos a day. The Lightning connector in the bottom is still the fastest way to charge the phone, with a full charge taking around two hours using an optional fast charger and USB-C cable.

For perspective the iPhone X lasted for 30 hours under the same conditions, while last year’s Huawei’s Mate 10 Pro lasted 50 hours. This year’s Samsung’s Galaxy S9+ only lasted 26 hours and the Note 9 only 25 hours, so it seems we’ve taken a step back in battery life in 2018.

Apple’s strength is that it pushes software updates to phones for a long time. The iPhone 5S, released in 2013, runs the same version of iOS as the iPhone XS Max.

The differences in how they behave come down to the gesture-based navigation that was introduced with the iPhone X last year, and not a lot has changed because iOS 12 concentrated on optimisation over new features.

The big addition is a set of wellbeing tools, alongside much better group notifications, which can be dismissed in one go. Siri Shortcuts, an extra app you can download, also allows power-user automation should you want it, setting up custom routines and trigger words you can utter to Siri.

One of the downsides with the iPhone XS Max is how little Apple has made of the large screen in software. There’s no split-screen multitasking or anything of that ilk. A few of Apple’s apps have a few more features compared to the smaller iPhone XS.

When in landscape there’s a slide-out inbox selector in Mail, chat selector in Messages, Reminders and Contacts get a split-screen view, while Calendar gets an iPad-style Day, Week, Month, Year selector and new view. The Settings app also adopts an iPad-style view in landscape. But these changes aren’t as useful as the enormous wealth of productivity features put into phones with screens this large by Samsung.

Face ID continues to be the only biometric security system on Apple’s iPhones. It works just as well as it did on the iPhone X for me, but wasn’t noticeably faster. Those wearing glasses may have difficulty, as will some with sunglasses, although it works perfectly fine when wearing a set of Oakley TwoFace XL Prizm Polarized sunglasses.

The dual camera system on the back of the iPhone XS Max has been improved since it first appeared on the iPhone X and 8 Plus last year. It features the same combo of 12-megapixel cameras, one wide angle and one with an effective optical zoom of 2x, but both image sensors and algorithms have been updated.

The result is markedly better low light performance, which still doesn’t quite beat rivals from Samsung or Huawei, but comes much closer. Detail preservation in images at full crop is also much improved, coming much closer to that of Google’s Pixel 2 XL.

The improved HDR mode, which is now on by default, is also better at dealing with high-contrast scenes, meaning shots into the sun and other bright areas are not as much of a problem.

Portraits are now noticeably better too, particularly the shallow depth of field effect around hair and other extremities. The bokeh is also now adjustable after the fact, which is fun.

The selfie camera is good, but not quite as rich in detailas some rivals. Video is also good, with better stabilisation than previous iPhones.

Overall the iPhone XS Max’s camera is rival for the very best in the business.
• None I got hand cramp placing my little finger under the bottom of the phone to support its weight, which I haven’t experienced with any other phone
• None When your hands are warm they stick to the glass back for an easier grip, but it’s pretty slippery when they’re cold
• None You can swipe side-to-side on the gesture bar to switch apps without invoking the recently used apps cards
• None Weirdly, restoring some apps such as Evernote from the background took an abnormal amount of time
• None The eSim for dual-sim support (two phone numbers on one phone) won’t be activated until later in the year
• None The holes in the bottom of the phone are no longer symmetrical, get over it
• None There’s a surprising amount of stereo separation from the speakers, which is all the better for annoying your fellow bus passengers

The iPhone XS Max comes in black, silver or gold, costing £1,099 for 64GB of storage, £1,249 for 256GB or £1,449 for 512GB.

For comparison, the 5.8in iPhone XS costs £999 for 64GB of storage, 6.4in Samsung Galaxy Note 9 costs £899 for 128GB, the 6.2in Galaxy S9+ costs £869 with 128GB of storage, 6.1in Huawei P20 Pro costs £669 with 128GB, the 6in Google Pixel 2 XL with 64GB costs £549, the 6.3in OnePlus 6 with 64GB costs £469.

The iPhone XS Max is big, beautiful and expensive. Its primary selling point is that enormous, gorgeous screen, which is really only useful for watching video or viewing photos.

But in maximising the screen, Apple has lost some of the charm that made the iPhone X and its replacement the XS so good. It is much more difficult to handle, heavier and bigger in your pocket.

The camera is great, battery life is OK, there’s wireless charging and a myriad of other features. It oozes opulence in a way other smartphones just don’t. But the same can be said of its smaller sibling. And there’s there’s the slightly smaller and cheaper 6.1in iPhone XR arriving later.

If you want the biggest iPhone, and can stomach the eye-watering asking price, then this is it. Just try not to drop it.

169,Australia news,"Australia's spyware law could expose phones to exploitation, business group warns",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/27/australias-spyware-law-could-expose-phones-to-exploitation-business-group-warns,2018-09-27T00:32:06Z,"Peter Dutton’s proposed legislation to expand the government’s surveillance capabilities into telecommunication devices through the inclusion of spyware risks could create “systemic weakness or vulnerability” that would be open to exploitation, Australia’s peak industry group has warned.

The Australian Industry Group has responded to the call for consultation on the assistance and access bill by warning of unintended consequences from the home affairs minister’s push to force telcos and tech giants, including Apple, Samsung, Google and Facebook, to include concealed “backdoors” into devices and messaging platforms.

In introducing the legislation last week, Dutton said the aim was to better equip law enforcement agencies to deal with new technologies, which he said were being “increasingly misused and indeed exploited” by “criminal syndicates and terrorists”.

In his speech, Dutton said the bill would give authorities “additional powers for overt and covert computer access”, which included “the use of software to collect information directly from devices”.

The government claims it is not asking companies to build weaknesses into their operating systems, but to either allow approved authorities access to existing weaknesses or install software or systems on individual devices to allow access.

In its submission, the Ai Group warned the government could inadvertently be providing criminal organisations with more tools, even if it was just a “one-off firmware update targeted at that suspect and no one else”.

“We are of the view that introducing any type of technical capability or functionality to grant access to a user’s hardware or services potentially creates a systemic weakness or vulnerability,” the group’s submission says. “Once developed, it may be capable of extension to any and all users and could also create an opening for others to take advantage of new and existing weaknesses in the system.”

The Ai Group submission follows similar criticisms from the Digital Industry Group on the draft exposure bill released last month, which also warned the bill risked opening devices up to attack.

The Ai Group also questioned the broadness of government definitions included in the legislation, such as “designated communications provider” and “eligible activities”.

“We would be concerned if broadly and vaguely scoped legislation could compel companies to build security vulnerabilities into their products – this would affect all users of that product and result in weaker security for everyone,” the industry group warned.

It also advised of international considerations, given the government could be creating “domestic laws that may be ineffective, out of step and and overreaching with other relevant jurisdictions”.

“At worst, applying a stricter regime in Australia than overseas could impact Australia’s digital capability and competitiveness, impeding network innovation, discouraging business presence in the Australian market, and leaving Australia behind,” it said.

“Additionally, this law could create a conflict for organisations operating in multiple jurisdictions if indeed it conflicts with data protection laws in operation in another country.”

Australia’s internal spy agency, Asio, and the department of home affairs can access encrypted data through existing laws, by using decryption techniques. The new legislation seeks to speed up the process.

Labor has so far urged caution with the legislation, but has not ruled out supporting it.

Similar legislation in the UK is now being reviewed and revised after it was successfully challenged over privacy concerns.",-0.9752,
170,Technology,Is a tablet or 2-in-1 laptop with a stylus useful for a student?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2018/sep/20/tablet-2-in-1-laptop-stylus-student-university,2018-09-20T11:37:55Z,"There are two issues here that go well beyond product choice, and can only be decided by you and your daughter. The first is whether a change in circumstances – going to university – requires the adoption of a new technology, whether it be a tablet or stylus or both. I’m assuming that your daughter doesn’t use either of these, or you would already know the answer.

The second issue is how a new device fits in with the ones she already uses. The days when everybody did everything with a desktop PC have long gone, and most people use a mixture of microprocessor-powered devices. These include smartphones, handhelds, tablets, Chromebooks, laptops, all-in-ones, desktops, workstations, games consoles and NAS servers, sometimes supplemented with smartpens and digital watches, cameras and recorders.

For example, it wouldn’t be very useful to run a system that comprised a 6in smartphone, a 7in or 8in tablet and a 10in laptop. If you were starting from scratch, I’d suggest a 6in smartphone, a 10-12in touch-screen convertible and a desktop PC or all-in-one with a 24in or 27in screen. That’s the kind of system I use myself. There’s not much overlap between the three devices, and you get the maximum value out of each one.

You should also think about integration. I’m assuming your daughter has a Windows laptop, because Apple users always mention it. If she has a MacBook Pro and an iPhone, she could easily integrate an iPad or, preferably, an iPad Pro with a Smart Keyboard. Those wouldn’t be obvious choices for someone with an Android smartphone and a Windows laptop.

I’m not saying you shouldn’t buy any particular product, just that you should think about how they all work together.

At one time, lots of us used styli with handheld organisers or PDAs (personal digital assistants) like the Palm and Pocket PC devices that were popular before smartphones swept the market. There were two reasons for this. First, we didn’t have capacitive screens that worked well with fingers. Second, the user interfaces required more precision than finger ends allowed. The stylus was really a mouse substitute. User interfaces had to be redesigned to make programs finger-friendly. This also added something you didn’t get with a stylus: the ability to use more than one finger at a time.

While the Pocket PC and Windows XP Tablet Edition provided pretty good character recognition, the stylus has never really been comfortable for extended note-taking. People try it but most of them soon give up. In my case, I switched to a Livescribe smartpen, which has the advantage of recording talks and interviews while you handwrite notes on special paper. (Other smartpens are available.) After that I went back to using reporters’ notebooks while recording things with a separate digital recorder.

More recent research from Princeton University found that students who take longhand notes learn better than the ones who take notes on a laptop.

I’d therefore suggest your daughter sticks with the familiar notebook and pen paradigm, and perhaps adds a digital recorder. (You can record things with a smartphone, but recording for several hours a day runs the battery down.)

My occasional need to turn cursive handwriting into text was solved by speech recognition on Android smartphones or Chrome browsers. (Other speech-to-text systems are available.)

Tablets have been around for decades – the GridPad was launched in 1989 – but consumer sales only took off when Apple launched the iPad in 2010. However, sales peaked in 2014, and the market has declined since then. Some regular users will stick with them because they’ve adapted to various apps, and they are terrific for toddlers, but most of us have given up on the idea that tablets can replace laptops.

The tablet market has also been disrupted by the growth of Windows 2-in-1s and convertibles. They aren’t great tablets, but they work well enough to replace dedicated tablets while still functioning as laptops.

Perhaps even more damage has been done by the growth in smartphone screens: even Apple has launched an iPhone with a 6.5in screen. Apps and websites now cater so well for big smartphones that tablets are becoming increasingly irrelevant.

If your daughter was already using a tablet at home and at school, I’m sure she would get some value from using one at university. But if she isn’t, I don’t see much point in starting now. I’d spend the money on a bigger smartphone, if necessary, and a portable keyboard.

Perhaps your daughter could try this minimalist system and see how it goes. She will soon find out whether she needs a bigger screen and a better keyboard while out and about.

You can get a lot done with a smartphone, a mini-keyboard and voice recognition. However, it’s not good for writing essays because you just can’t see enough words on the screen, and editing – moving blocks of text around – is painful. If your daughter needs to do any writing or serious research on campus then there’s no substitute for a 10in or preferably larger screen. In this case, the options include tablets, Chromebooks, and Windows 2-in-1s and convertibles.

In reality, there’s not that much difference in price. Cheap tablets are generally awful, and by the time you’ve bought a decent keyboard/case, you might as well have bought a proper 2-in-1.

Good Chromebooks are about the same price as Windows laptops, and may sport much the same hardware, but most of them don’t have touch screens. The main advantages are the elimination of maintenance, such as installing updates, and possibly better battery life. The inherent lack of functionality should not be a problem because the Chromebook is supplementing a laptop, not trying to replace it.

Windows 2-in-1s have the advantage of being portable, they can double as tablets, and can still run the full Microsoft Office and other software for working on the go. And your daughter, I assume, already knows how to use one. The main drawback is the maintenance, but that’s not a problem if the device works correctly when using an external hard drive for Windows updates.

A Microsoft Surface Pro is almost the ideal student device, but costs too much for your purposes, and duplicates the functions of your daughter’s more-than-adequate laptop. You might look at the new Surface Go as a more affordable option (£360 to students, keyboard extra), and yes, it does support a pen. Our own Samuel Gibbs just gave it a five-star review.

One alternative is the 10.6in Samsung Galaxy Book SM-W620, which includes a keyboard/case and S Pen for £399.97.

A much cheaper alternative is a 10in touch-screen Lenovo Miix 320, which currently costs £129.99. I normally recommend against Windows machines with only 2GB of memory and 32GB of storage. However, I bought an earlier Miix 3 for £150 three years ago, and it has always updated Windows 10 correctly when plugged into an external hard drive.

All of these machines have Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixel) screens.

Otherwise, the 4GB/64GB Linx 10V64 is still pretty good value at £219.99, on clearance at Argos, or £216.99 at eBuyer.

If you fancy trying a Chromebook, an 11.6in Acer with 2GB of memory and 16GB of storage is a cheap touch-screen option at £179.99, but the screen resolution drops to 1366 x 768 pixels. I’d rather have an Asus Flip with a 360-degree hinge, and Argos has an ARM-powered Flip C101PA with a 10.1in 1280 x 800-pixel touch screen for £299.99. Sadly, the superior 12.5in Intel Core-based Flip C302CA costs £499.99 (with an m3-6Y30) or £649.99 (with an m7-6Y75).

As for tablets, I’ve lost touch with the Android market or, more accurately, I’ve defected to a 10.1in Amazon Fire HD (£149.99), which is a non-work device. Perhaps readers can suggest a few options. Or your daughter might be tempted by a 9.7in iPad (from £319) – which is now compatible with the Apple Pencil (£89) – and a keyboard/case (£20).

171,Technology,Nest Hello review: Google's smart facial-recognition video doorbell,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/20/nest-hello-review-google-smart-facial-recognition-video-doorbell,2018-09-20T08:33:52Z,"Google’s new Nest Hello is a video doorbell that aims to be smarter than the rest with constant recording, face and object recognition.

The Hello is a direct replacement for a wired doorbell, working with an existing chime and requiring constant power, making it one of the high-end options for smart doorbells.

That need for power restricts where you can put it, unlike some more flexible options such as the battery-powered Ring Video Doorbell 2, but enables some much more powerful features.

What is it?

The Hello is a simple-looking modern doorbell featuring one large button with a glowing blue ring around it and a camera above it. It’s about twice the size of a traditional doorbell and is screwed directly into the wall.

When someone approaches the door the light ring pulses around the doorbell button, enticing them to push it. The doorbell fires off the connected chime when pushed, but also sends a notification to your phone and can make any of your Google Home smart speakers sound an alert too.

You can then choose to ignore the caller, hit buttons in the app to read out an automated message (options are: “You can leave it”; “We’ll be right there”, and, a little abruptly, “No one can come to the door”) or talk through the doorbell to the caller using your phone.

The Hello is either a doddle to set up or a bit of a task, depending on whether you have a wired doorbell already and the voltage of its transformer.

If you have a wired doorbell with the correct voltage transformer, then switching it out for the Nest Hello is as simple as unscrewing the old one, disconnecting two wires, drilling two holes in the wall, screwing the backplate in place, reconnecting the wires to the back of the Hello and clipping it in place. It’ll take you about five to 10 minutes to do guided by a setup routine in the Nest app on your Android or iPhone.

That’s the easy way. Unfortunately it turns out that the Hello needs a transformer outputting a voltage between 16 and 24V AC that isn’t commonly used in British homes, which means you’ll probably need a new transformer and an electrician to install it for you.

Then there are the homes with no wired doorbell, like mine, which require not only a transformer to be installed, but a chime and all the wiring too – a process that can take several hours and will need a qualified electrician to do the work.

Google sells the Hello either on its own or with professional installation, but that installation only covers replacing an existing wired doorbell with the Nest Hello and swapping out the transformer, if required. To get an electrician to install all the wiring necessary if you don’t have a wired doorbell already requires organising separately.

Once the Hello is installed, using it is incredibly simple. Like the Nest Thermostat, if you never really use any of the “smart” functionality, the Hello functions like a really snazzy doorbell. And it isn’t a worse doorbell than the existing wired one it replaces, which isn’t always the case with smart home devices.

When someone hits the button it will fire off the chime and an alert to your phone, plus any Google Assistant smart speakers you might have too. If you’re in the home most of the time you’ll probably just glance at the image of who is there in the notification and simply answer the door in person.

But if you don’t know who it is – someone trying to sell you a new religion or political party – you can talk to them straight through the Nest app on your phone. Tapping the notification takes you to a live feed from the door with a button to answer and talk to the caller, a button to play a selection of pre-recorded messages or the option to ignore the caller.

It works in or outside of the home, as long as you have an internet connection on your phone. You can also access a live stream from the camera at any time through the Nest app or through compatible smart displays such as Amazon’s Echo Show.

The rest of the non-doorbell functionality changes depending on whether you take out a Nest Aware subscription.

Without the monthly cloud storage you have the option to enable various basic alerts, such as when the camera spots a person, any other movement or hears a sound. Each notification comes with a snapshot image taken from the camera, which is saved in the Nest app as a timeline of previous events, although I found that the images for just-happened events didn’t always appear immediately in the timeline.

With a Nest Aware subscription, which starts at £4 a month, things get a more advanced. The Hello constantly streams video up to the cloud, which records 24 hours a day allowing you not only to see snapshots of events but everything in between, making it an excellent security camera.

The video quality is very good, even at night, and captured in high-dynamic range (HDR), which makes a real difference if your camera faces into the sun. The video is recorded in a 4:3 ratio with a relatively wide angle. Like all these cameras, it’s still difficult to make out a name badge on a caller when they’re standing away from the door, but you can clearly make out faces and logos.

The streaming video is processed in real-time by Google’s AI in the cloud enabling a series of smarter tools too. For instance, you get a similar set of notifications, for people, movement and sound as before, but they’re slightly enhanced, noticeably removing more false positives and allowing you to narrow down notifications to only certain zones within the camera’s field of view.

The notifications sent to your phone also contain gifs, showing a small animated snapshot of the person or object, making it easier to see whether you need to do anything about the notification.

Tapping the notification takes you straight to the full video of the event in question, which you can then save and share if needed. You can also zoom in on a particular area, should you want to keep an eye on a set spot more closely.

Facial recognition is the Hello’s big differentiator over rivals such as Amazon’s Ring. It is powered by Google’s cloud, and as such requires a Nest Aware subscription. The idea is that as people come near the front door the system spots faces and then allows you to tag them with names. Next time that person comes to the door and presses the button, the notification you get on your phone will show their name, and Google’s smart speakers can announce their name too.

In practice the facial recognition isn’t quite as magical or terrifying as you might imagine. It recognised most individuals as multiple people, but allows you to manually merge them into one and delete images that aren’t of the right person. Initially that meant the Hello recognised me as three separate people – one “Sam” with sunglasses and two other “Sams” without until I merged them all together as one “Sam” to rule them all.

For less frequent visitors it sometimes failed to recognise them as previously tagged faces.

There are also privacy concerns around constant recording and facial recognition, although all the video and facial data is only accessible to your Nest account. You’re also not associating faces with accounts or anything like that, but it’s important you explain all this to your neighbours at the very least.
• None The Nest app runs you through full installation instructions that you can’t skip, even if you’ve had an electrician install the doorbell for you. Tedious.
• None The hyperlapse effect of scrolling through a full day’s video is really beautiful, watching the sun streak across the sky
• None I received far too many notifications for people passing by without a Nest Aware subscription, meaning I had to turn them off
• None Shadows of people walking are identified as people, setting off the alert even if the person isn’t actually in your motion zone
• None The Hello is weather-proof, but the backplate doesn’t fit all that tightly to the wall, so water can get in behind it if it’s exposed to torrential rain or similar
• None You’ll need a strong wifi signal for the doorbell and an uncapped broadband connection for the Nest Aware video recording
• None You can silence the chime for 30 minutes to three hours, but can’t schedule it to be quiet overnight or similar – you can toggle it on or off in the app manually though

The Nest Hello costs £229 on its own, or £329 with professional installation. Nest Aware subscriptions cost £4 a month (£40 a year) for five-day video history, £8 a month (£80 a year) for 10-day video history or £24 a month (£240 a year) for 30-day video history.

The Nest Hello is an excellent smart doorbell that’s still good at being a regular doorbell. If you rarely use the smart bits, it’ll work OK without an add-on subscription.

When you do want to use the smart functionality, a Nest Aware subscription is almost certainly a necessity, which is at least another £4-a-month add-on. You get value for money out of it though, with seven days or more of constant video from your front door making it an excellent security camera, plus smarter and more useful alerts and other bits.

With a little bit of work on your end, the facial recognition should prove useful for regular guests and far less invasive than you might anticipate.

The biggest issue with the Hello is its stringent requirements for wiring and power. It might be a hurdle you only have to clear once, but it certainly adds to the cost and difficulty of fitting it in the first place.

The Hello is a great, high-end, feature-rich option for a smart video doorbell that looks the part on the front of your house. It’s just not quite leagues ahead of the competition.

172,Games,Can buying the best gear make you a better gamer?,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/sep/20/buying-best-gear-gamer-specialist-gaming-hardware,2018-09-20T05:00:18Z,"Action video games are all about reflexes and accuracy. Whether you’re wielding an assault rifle in Fortnite or a battle axe in Witcher 3, the speed at which you can find a target and launch something at it will generally dictate how long you survive.

But what if you were not born with the sharpest reactions or the handiest of hand-eye coordination? Can hardware help? We asked a range of experts what to look for in equipment such as headsets, controllers and monitors, and tried some out ourselves. Here’s what we discovered.

There is one big benefit with headsets: they allow you to pinpoint the spatial positioning of sound effects much more accurately than through TV speakers. So a decent pair of phones will almost definitely improve your performance in shooters such as Fortnite, Overwatch and Call of Duty, in all of which you need to hear exactly where your enemies are coming from. Headsets with mic attachments also let you chat to your squad mates, which is important if your tactical approach is anything more advanced than “let’s run around and shoot at things until we’re dead”.

So what should you look for in a good headset? “The fundamental things are sound quality, all-day comfort, build quality and a great microphone,” says Nick Bourne, director of product management, eSports and partnerships at headset manufacturer Turtle Beach. “You’ll want a great microphone so you’re heard loud and clear by your squad, and make sure the build quality is good enough to take the brunt of a few lost one-on-one situations, and hopefully some Victory Royale celebrations. A great place to start is by asking your friends what equipment they’re using, especially if their voice sounds clear and natural in-game – that’s a sign that you will too.”

For console owners, most of the pro gamers we spoke to recommended Turtle Beach as a reliable brand from budget to professional level. The Stealth 300 (£70) is a good intermediate set, with metal-reinforced headband and memory foam ear cushions, the wireless, noise-cancelling 700 model (£105) moves things up a notch, and the Elite Pro (£170) is the high-end tournament choice with great comfort and sound.

YouTuber and Xbox On presenter Benny Central says the upper end Astro and Razer sets are also widely used on the pro circuit. I’ve tried the sleek, lightweight Razer Kraken Pro (£80) and the feature-packed Razer Thresher Ultimate (£250), and they are both very good. With its chunky build, super comfortable cups and noise-cancelling tech, the Sennheiser GSP 600 headset (£220) is also gaining traction in the pro scene. Right now, I’m using the HyperX Cloud Alpha (£90), which is super comfortable, has a nice weight, a good microphone and excellent sound – a great all-rounder.

However, for PC gamers, a couple of experts we spoke to recommended staying away from specialist headsets. “Buy headphones from companies that specialise in them,” says developer Chris Wilson. “Sennheiser, Audio-Technica, Beyerdynamic, etc, aren’t even that expensive compared with some of the higher end ‘gaming’-branded headsets. They’ll also last a lot longer and have replaceable parts. A good pairing would be an entry-level set of headphones from any of these companies, and something like a ModMic5 stuck on the side. I use a Beyerdynamic DT 797 headset, which also doubles as my setup for live streaming.”

A range of surround-sound technologies are coming in, but Wilson is sceptical. “They are still more of a gimmick – a decent pair of stereo headphones will produce better results, even for location tracking. Software can do an excellent job of providing positional cues through stereo.”

Having the right display is vital in games where being able to spot and identify targets quickly is the key to survival. So any action game then. A screen with low input lag (the time it takes for the TV to display what your games machine sends to it) gives you vital milliseconds to line up a shot or move to cover. The sweet spot is a lag of 20 milliseconds, but anything over 30ms is a problem.

You might think the best option would be a 65-inch LED monster with stacks of high-end image-enhancing technology – but you’d be wrong. A giant screen makes it more difficult to scan the area for potential threats and to monitor the game’s mini-map, which is crucial in military shooters such as Call of Duty. Pro players we spoke to tend to stick with 24-inch to 32-inch displays. Furthermore, features such as 4K ultra-high definition (UHD) and high dynamic range (HDR) can add significantly to lag, so make sure you have a TV with a decent gaming mode, which will switch these off. The website Rtings regularly reviews new models from a gaming perspective, but I’ve always used Samsung sets, which have excellent gaming modes and decent lag times.

The alternative is a specialised, dedicated monitor, and this is especially important for PC players: a good monitor will provide you with crystal-clear visual information and much slicker spatial movement and awareness. “Three things are important to me,” says Nicolai “dev1ce” Reedtz from the Astralis team. “I look for a refresh rate of 240Hz, the lowest response time possible, and colour controls: I prefer a lot of saturation on my monitor, so this needs to be customisable. The screen size is important, too. We play on 24-inch monitors at tournaments, so I always go for that.”

All the big brands (Asus, Acer, LG, Iiyama, Dell) produce decent models. You’ll need to consider the resolution of the screen, the type of panel and the refresh rate – the higher the better. “Once you’ve tried 144Hz, it’s hard to go back,” says Wilson, “But you need to have the hardware to drive games at that frame rate.” You’ll also need to ensure your graphics card is synced with the monitor so that the visuals don’t tear up under the stress. Nvidia’s G-Sync and AMD’s Freesync technologies are the current solutions, although Nvidia is also trying to get its BFGD (big format gaming display) format off the ground.

Finally, veteran hardware reviewer Mike Jennings says that curved monitors are great for immersion, which can really help with racing sims, but they’re expensive.

There are two key issues with gaming mice: comfort and response times. Both can affect your performance.

“The key thing is: how large is your hand, and how do you like to hold mice?” says Alex Walker at Kotaku. “Build quality matters, but if the shape of the mouse is wrong, you’ll always be up against it.” He recommends measuring your handspan and comparing this with the specifications of mice you are considering buying.

As for response times? “You need main buttons that are shallow, fast and clicky, which means you’ll have rapid response during frantic games,” says Jennings. “All the big-brand stuff, at a reasonable price, will be fine in this regard – but you do get improvements – and diminishing returns – as you go up the scale of prices. Optical sensors give more precision and faster response times than laser sensors.”

Will a mouse that can handle 12,000 dpi (dots per inch) make you better? Jennings is sceptical. “High-end mice will boast of insane dpi figures, but the vast majority of players will never need to go near the top end of those scales. Even eSports players won’t need to truly push it.”

Andy Kelly at PC Gamer – which has just published a mouse guide – swears by the Razer DeathAdder (“to me, it’s pretty much perfect”); Jennings suggests the Corsair Gaming M65 Pro RGB FPS (£59) at intermediate level, and the Razer Mamba Tournament Edition (£90) for serious competitive players, thanks to its adjustable click force, tilting scroll wheel and 16,000 dpi sensor.

All the experts we spoke to recommended using a mechanical keyboard, where each button press is controlled by a mechanism rather than a plastic dot or membrane. “Mechanical keyboards are best for gaming 99% of the time, as they have the fastest, firmest and most familiar response,” says Jennings. “For many years, most mechanical keyboards used switches made by a company called Cherry MX. They use different colours to denote switches with different characteristics – some are louder, others quieter. Some have more pronounced ‘bumps’ in their typing action like old-school IBM keyboards, while some are smoother, without bumps.”

Now, companies such as Razer and Logitech are making their own mechanical keyboard switches, but the effect is the same: sharper and more precise control over the action. More expensive keyboards offer features such as macro keys (“important for customisation of gaming combos,” says Jennings) and dedicated media buttons, but they’re more about preference.

“I use a Logitech G413, which is pretty highly regarded, and is tastefully designed,” says Andy Kelly (his magazine has a keyboard buyer’s guide, too). Jennings suggests the Corsair K55 RGB (£50) which has RGB LED backlighting and six programmable macro keys, but doesn’t have a mechanical keyboard. The Cooler Master Masterkeys Pro L RGB (£90) has CherryMX mechanical switches, customisable RGB LEDs, macro support and Windows software for customisation. Then there’s the high-end Corsair Strafe RGB (£150) which offers a raft of features including, “fully programmable buttons, a USB port, sets of keys for FPS or MOBA play, 100% anti-ghosting, media controls and a tangle-free cable”.

Until recently, the best joypads were made by console manufacturers. Third-party alternatives tended to be less robust budget options. Now models such as the Razer Raiju (or the Wildcat or Wolverine), the Nacon Revolution Pro and the Scuf Infinity all offer excellent build quality and additional features designed to give you an edge.

“Before we founded Scuf, there was a perception that third-party controllers were cheaper alternatives for the cost sensitive or modded/cheat controllers with rapid-fire chips,” says Duncan Ironmonger, chief executive and co-founder of Scuf Gaming. “Changing this perception took a lot of time and education. I spent a great amount of time travelling to Pro Gaming events in the US and Europe talking to the professional gamers about why paddles and hair triggers made sense.”

But do they work? Well, we’ve tried the latest Impact model from Scuf (£115), arguably the company that kickstarted the modern pro controller market. It provides customisable thumbsticks, trigger extenders and adjustable hair-trigger mechanisms (letting you adjust how sensitive the triggers are). These are all really nice features, but they’re more about comfort and preference than outright performance enhancement.

The key addition is the four programmable paddles on the underside of the pad, which – like the extra buttons on the Razer Raiju, for example – are intended to give you quicker access to certain in-game actions. Instead of pressing the four main buttons on the front of the Xbox or PS4 pad to reload, crouch or change weapon, you remap those controls to the paddles, so you’re not taking your right thumb off the analogue stick, thereby losing valuable seconds.

They take a bit of getting used to, but they do make a difference. In Fortnite, being able to reload or switch to building tools by just nudging a paddle has been a lifesaver on several occasions.

Verdict: Yes, specialised hardware can make a difference to your gaming prowess but you need not buy the most expensive “pro” equipment. A decent, comfortable headset will improve your sensory perception, a better keyboard and mouse set-up will improve your click efficiency, and a monitor with a super fast refresh rate will give you a more fluid view of the game world, but none of these have to be top end.

173,Technology,iPhone XS and XS Max review roundup: you might want to wait,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/18/iphone-xs-max-review-roundup-iphone-xr,2018-09-18T12:27:40Z,"The first wave of verdicts from select reviewers given early access to Apple’s latest iPhone XS and XS Max are live.

Gone are the traditional iPhones of yesteryear, with three devices launched all with a design in line with last year’s iPhone X. The iPhone XS is a direct replacement for the 2017 iPhone X, complete with a 5.8in screen costing £999. The iPhone XS Max is a larger, more expensive phone costing £1,099 and with a 6.5in screen, the largest on an iPhone.

The iPhone XR is a slightly cheaper phone costing £749 with a 6.1in screen, but it won’t be released until October.

The Guardian, not given early access to the new phones, will review them when they arrive in the post with normal punters’ pre-orders. But for now, this is what a privileged few thought of the to most expensive iPhones for 2018.

Rhiannon Williams writing for the i newspaper, calls the iPhone XS a worthy iPhone X replacement. Williams says of the new gold colour:

It’s a pretty and premium design befitting of a phone which starts at £999, but also one which strikes me as being still worryingly susceptible to damage. The glass back is slippery when not covered in a case, though it doesn’t seem to collect as many fingerprints as the iPhone X, and it’s fairly heavy despite being thin. It also looks and feels expensive, which is just as well, because it is.

But it is the camera improvements that are worth buying:

Scott Stein from Cnet agrees - it’s all about the camera:

The better sensor and the new image processor on the A12 Bionic chip combine to enable what Apple calls “Smart HDR.” In practice, that means my photos look better in low light and extreme contrast situations, making for better pictures whether shot on a night-time street, in a dark bar or in bright sunlight. Bright lights in my living room show more detail now, and don’t turn into blown-up bright spots like they used to. I see more detail around windows and street lights. I’m also finding less blur and noise in most shots. Sometimes, it almost seems like too much light. The colour and brightness of some shots is surprising. I’m much happier with my photos now.

Nilay Patel from the Verge found Apple’s biometrics slightly improved, but Face ID still fails where it did on last year’s phone:

FaceID on the XS is ever so slightly faster than the X — just an extra beat quicker. It’s noticeable side by side, but it’s not so much faster that you won’t find yourself pointedly staring at the phone to unlock it from time to time. iOS 12 lets you add a “secondary appearance,” which allows you to set up a second person if you want, which is nice. Other than the minor speed increase and secondary appearance support, FaceID is still FaceID: it doesn’t work in landscape or upside down or anything like that. If you wear glasses like me, you’ll still have to enter your passcode every morning when you wake up because you’re holding the phone too close to your face for it to work. And sunglasses that block IR light will still prevent it from working — Apple says it’s working with sunglass makers to ship new kinds of sunglasses that support FaceID. (Only Apple can get another entirely different industry to adapt to its phone, instead of the other way around.)

CNBC’s Todd Haselton describes the new models as the best phones you can buy, but advises you skip them if you already have an iPhone X:

The XS is basically a new model with some improvements. Most of those improvements, though, are kind of hard to notice. Take the screen, for example. It’s still a brilliant, colourful and sharp OLED display that supports next-gen HDR 4K video. It’s one of the best screens on the market, up there with the display on the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. But some of the improvements, like its increased dynamic range, can only be spotted when viewing photos. And even then, I don’t think most folks will notice. This isn’t bad; it just means the screen is still really good and we’re getting to a point where it’s hard to distinguish upgrades.

Wired journalist Lauren Goode concurs, calling the iPhone XS and XS Max an evolution, not a revolution:

Aside from one of the phones having a giant display, the iPhone XS and the larger iPhone XS Max don’t feel much different from last year’s iPhone X. This year’s phones don’t spark strong feelings – except maybe chagrin that they cost so much. It’s impressive incrementalism: There’s a noticeably faster chip, and a camera that captures a greater level of detail that you can actually see. Apple has nudged innovation in smartphones forward again, even if some of the results (like new apps that will use the new tech) have yet to be experienced.

Joanna Stern, writing for the Wall Street Journal, goes one step further advising readers to “sit tight for the XR“:

With subtle but strong improvements over last year’s X, (subtle, that’s what the S stands for, right?) the XS and XS Max are fabulous phones. But we’ve hit a point where every smartphone is great — it comes down to what you want and what you want to spend. Don’t blame me, blame Apple … and keep your wallet closed. See you in a month with the XR review.

Stern also noted that you’ll probably need a case if you do buy one of these £1,000+ phones:

On the iPhone XS Max, Gareth Beavis writing for TechRadar said that Apple’s managed to fit a huge 6.5in display into a form factor that does a good job of keeping it usable. But Beavis noted:

The iPhone XS Max design is deceptive. Pick it up, and the rounded sides of the handset make it feel noticeably thick. The result is a phone that doesn’t sit as comfortably in the hand as it could, and considering the size and cost of the XS Max it’s a phone you want to be able to securely hold. This is only half the story though. We compared the iPhone XS Max to a number of phones during our in-depth review, including the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (6.4-inch screen), OnePlus 6 (6.2-inch) and Sony Xperia XZ3 (6-inch), and the iPhone felt thicker, and less planted in the hand then all of them. The funny thing is though, the iPhone XS Max is thinner than all of those phones at just 7.7mm. The reason for this is simple: tapered edges. The Samsung, Sony and OnePlus all taper their rear edges, giving the impression of a thinner device while also allowing them to sit a little better in the curvature of your hand. The iPhone XS Max has a totally flat back that’s a little more awkward to hold, and we found that a tactfully-placed pinkie finger on the underside of the phone was a must for one-handed use.

But for the i newspaper’s Williams, the iPhone XS Max’s size is a virtue:

There’s been a lot of discussion raging online over whether it’s too big, which I wholly disagree with. The iPhone XS Max demands two hands, and how much you enjoy this will hinge on how accustomed you are to using larger handsets. I’ve been a fan of larger phones for years, so not being able to text one-handed or having to stretch my hand up to reach and pull down the Control Centre is worth it in terms of the benefits presented by a larger screen: higher resolution, making watching TV, films and videos a better experience, and making it easier to play games, write documents and emails and edit photos. If you don’t like larger phones, the answer is simple: no one’s forcing you to buy one.

So while the iPhone XS and XS Max appear to be the best smartphones Apple has made, and you won’t be disappointed if you’re an iPhone-only buyer and have already pre-ordered them, it might be worth waiting to see what the marginally cheaper iPhone XR is like before sinking £1,000 into a new iPhone.",0.9997,
174,Travel,New-style TripAdvisor aims to be the world's first ‘travel feed’,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/sep/17/new-style-tripadvisor-aims-to-be-the-worlds-first-travel-feed,2018-09-17T17:14:34Z,"Trip Advisor is to launch a new website and mobile-device platform later this year that it claims will make it “the most personalised and connected travel community” in the world.

Currently in beta format, the new-style TripAdvisor will look to expand its community beyond travellers leaving reviews to include publishers, such as National Geographic, as well as brands and social media influencers. Travellers will be able to follow and connect with individuals or content creators who share information that is relevant to their interests and travel plans.

Alongside TripAdvisor’s 661 million reviews and opinions, members will be able to create and view content, including photos, videos and articles. Members will have the chance to create “trips”, which can be in-depth travel guides, itineraries with maps or simple wishlists of things to do while travelling, which can either be kept private for personal use or shared to inspire and help other travellers.

Powered by what is claimed to be the world’s first “travel feed”, members will be able to discover more information when planning trips. As well as National Geographic, other publishers taking part in the scheme include Condé Nast Traveler, the Travel Channel, Business Insider and Insider Guides, PopSugar, Great Big Story (CNN Travel), Pandora Music, GoPro, Goop, NYC & Company (via its consumer-facing tourism website, nycgo.com), Nashville Music City, and The Knot.

TripAdvisor is the world’s biggest travel site, although it has struggled to control the proliferation of fake reviews. In 2011, the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority opened an investigation into TripAdvisor, eventually ordering it “not to claim or imply that all the reviews that appeared on the website were from real travellers, or were honest, real or trusted”. The travel firm changed its motto from “Reviews You Can Trust” to “Know better. Book better. Go better.”

Chris Thorman, vice-president of community products and growth at National Geographic, said: “We’re excited to be among the first publishers to join the new TripAdvisor, further expanding our travel footprint. As a global media company, we’re always seeking new opportunities to share our awe-inspiring articles, photos and video content, and a partnership with TripAdvisor allows us to do just that.”",0.9904,
175,World news,Moon Jae-in prepares for make or break inter-Korean summit with Kim Jong-un,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/17/moon-jae-in-prepares-for-make-or-break-inter-korean-summit-with-kim-jong-un,2018-09-17T02:52:10Z,"The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, will seek to salvage stalled nuclear negotiations between North Korea and the US during a summit with Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang on Tuesday that could make or break his legacy.

Moon said on Monday that he would push for “irreversible, permanent peace”, and better dialogue between Pyongyang and Washington during the “heart-to-heart” talks.

The South Korean president also said he wanted “to find a middle ground between a US request for [North Korea’s] denuclearization and the North’s request for corresponding measures such as ending hostile relations and security assurances.”

It will be the first trip by a South Korean leader to the North Korean capital in 11 years, after two previous summits between the men this year. Moon’s success will be determined by whether the North Korean leader makes concessions on his nuclear program, and it is his top priority, according to Moon Chung-in, an outspoken South Korean presidential advisor.

The South Korean president is also planning to discuss reducing military tensions between the two Koreas, and could secure troop reductions on the heavily militarised border.

“President Moon will try to persuade Kim to come up with some bold moves,” Moon Chung-in said at a briefing. If North Korea “comes up with some shocking concessions, and then the US responds boldly, verification could come later. This would build trust that’s lacking between Washington and Pyongyang”.

In response, he added: “America should provide North Korea with political assurances, with a liaison office, military assurances, with a non aggression treaty, and economic assurances, with investments.”

Kim and Moon first met at the border village of Panmunjom in April, where Kim committed to the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, a phrase criticised by experts who say it is too vague. Moon is likely to try to get Kim to commit to more forceful language at the summit in Pyongyang this week.

Moon will fly from Seongnam Air Base, just outside Seoul, at 8:40am local time, arriving in Pyongyang about an hour and a half later. He will meet Kim and later be treated to a welcome dinner, likely hosted by Kim.

The April meeting eventually led to Kim flying to Singapore in June for a summit with Donald Trump, the first time a sitting US president met with the leader of North Korea. But as the flurry of diplomacy quieted down, there has been little progress in the US goal of North Korea relinquishing its nuclear arsenal. Trump even cancelled a trip by secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Pyongyang for fear it would not yield concrete results.

Compared to their previous meetings, “denuclearisation is a key issue” at this summit, according to Im Jong-seok, the South Korean presidential chief of staff. Moon plans to raise the issue at least twice, Im said.

Moon Chung-in admitted there was still “a huge perception gap between Washington and Pyongyang”, where Kim feels he has made concessions and US officials want to see more concrete steps such as shipping nuclear warheads out of North Korea.

“Kim Jong-un, I wouldn’t say he’s progressive, but he’s much more open minded and liberal and he knows what’s going on in the outside world,” said Moon Chung-in, who met Kim in April.

In the days leading up to the summit, the two Koreas opened a joint liaison office in Kaesong, just across the border in North Korea, to maintain constant communication. Where the two sides previously spoke over telephone and fax lines, about 20 officials from each side will staff the office and speak each day.

“We hope that this will also help the progress of denuclearisation talks between North Korea and the United States,” Baik Tae-hyun, South Korea’s unification ministry spokesman, said of the office.

But significant gaps remain. Washington has demanded North Korea unilaterally disarm, before negotiations over a proposed peace treaty, formally ending the 1950-53 Korean war, or any sanctions relief is granted. North Korean officials have repeatedly said they have already made concessions, by closing nuclear and rocket test sites, and want incremental concessions from both sides throughout the process.

Experts and satellite images suggest North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear program and there has been new construction at its only known nuclear plant. For Moon’s trip to Pyongyang, the best he can likely hope for is improving the situation locally on the Korean peninsula.

He is bringing a host of business leaders from South Korean firms, including Samsung, Hyundai motor, LG and Posco, a steel company, as they prepare for possible investments in the country if sanctions are lifted. Moon has previously tried to encourage Kim to denuclearise by offering economic support.

“The two Koreas are moving ahead with improving relations on all fronts including reducing military tensions,” said Duyeon Kim, a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security. “But things could get dicey with Washington if their activities run up against sanctions or if they do things without keeping Washington in the loop.”",0.9958,
176,Technology,Honor Play review: great all-round smartphone for under £300,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/05/honor-play-review-huawei-gaming-phone-bargain-all-round-metal-body-screen,2018-09-05T06:00:53Z,"Huawei’s Honor sub-brand has been firing out great phones at a rate of knots, with the Honor Play the latest in its line of lower-cost top-spec phones.

The Play doesn’t deviate from the winning formula used by the last few top-end Honor smartphones: a flagship processor, plenty of memory and storage, a big screen and battery life reaching well into the second day.

On the outside the Play is a remix of sorts between the Honor 10 with its notched screen and the metal unibody of the Honor 10 View (which was confusingly released before the Honor 10).

The result is a very smooth and solid-feeling phone reminiscent of the iPhone 7, with a simple metal back and a front dominated by the screen. Glass may be the material of the moment, but the Honor Play is one of the best feeling phones to my hands right now.

The full HD+ LCD screen is big, bright and crisp with excellent viewing angles, but it’s also long and relatively narrow, which makes handling it relatively easy.

The large notch at the top of the screen containing the selfie camera, sensors and earpiece speaker gets in the way more than I would like. With Bluetooth headphones connected, the phone set to vibrate and connected to wifi there is no room in the status bar for any notification icons.

At 7.5mm thick and 176g in weight, the Play matches up well to all its top-end competition. There’s a headphone socket and USB-C port in the bottom, a small dual-camera lump and an excellent fingerprint scanner on the back.

The Honor Play has the same Huawei Kirin 970 processor and 4GB of memory as the Honor 10, and performs similarly in day-to-day usage. The phone feels snappy, apps launch quickly and switching between those apps fast, if not quite on a par with the OnePlus 6.

Gaming performance was solid but not exceptional in my testing: 30 minute stints of Shadowgun Legends were relatively smooth and consumed only 0.5% of battery per minute. For comparison, the same game running on a Google Pixel 2XL consumed 1% per minute, making the Honor Play twice as efficient for similar performance.

Considering it is a phone marketed for gaming, it’s a shame the Play doesn’t have stereo speakers, but at least the one in the end of the phone is quite loud.

Battery life for the Play worked out slightly worse than Honor’s other Kirin 970-powered phones. It lasted an average of 28 hours between charges, starting at 8am one day and making it through till lunchtime on day two.

That was while using it as my primary device, browsing and using apps for five hours while receiving hundreds of push emails and messages, reading comics for 30 minutes, playing games for 30 minutes, taking about 20 photos and listening to seven hours of music via Bluetooth headphones.

The Honor 10 runs Huawei’s modified version of Android called EMUI 8.2, based on Android Oreo 8.1.

It is essentially the same version as running on the Honor 10, looking like a cross between Android and Apple’s iOS.

EMUI includes the option to switch between having an app drawer or having every app on the homescreen. The Google app’s personalised feed is available on the left-most homescreen pane, and the notifications have a more rounded card look, similar to the recently released Android 9 Pie.

The notch can also be hidden in a permanent black status bar, and there are plenty of power-saving features you can activate if you need the phone to last as long as possible.

EMUI 8.2 is arguably the best version of Huawei’s software yet, being much less of a Marmite experience for most, but running on last year’s Android Oreo rather than the new Android 9 Pie is a little disappointing, if not unexpected for a phone launched in late August.

The dual camera on the back of the Play is similar to previous Honor models, but with a lower-resolution 2-megapixel secondary camera that is just there for depth perception for simulated bokeh in portraits. The primary 16-megapixel camera has Honor’s AI system from the Honor 10.

The camera is capable of capturing detailed photos, even in middling light without the AI system turned on. It isn’t quite on par with the best of the best, but it also isn’t that far off.

With the AI system active, which is meant to recognise objects and optimise the camera’s scent, colours simply looked oversaturated, as if they’ve been passed through an Instagram filter.

The 16-megapixel selfie camera is really very good too, capturing far more detail in the face than even £1,000 phones. Some may not find capturing every blemish and wrinkle all that flattering, but when you can see the reflection of the phone in the lens of your own eye in a selfie, I think you’re on to a winner. You can also enable the various degrees of beauty mode to smooth out your skin.
• None Huawei’s Histen sound processing can simulate different 3D sound, such as speakers placed in front of you, using regular wired headphones
• None Vibrations in game are short, sharp and tightly controlled
• None It comes with a clear TPU case in the box
• None Huawei’s facial recognition is very fast, although the fingerprint scanner is more secure

The Honor Play costs £279.99 and is available in blue or black.

For comparison, the 5.9in Honor 10 costs £400 with 128GB of storage, the 6in Honor 10 View costs £450 with 128GB, the 6.1in Huawei P20 Pro costs £799 with 128GB, the 6.28in OnePlus 6 costs £469 with 64GB, the 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S9+ costs £869 with 128GB, the 6in Google Pixel 2 XL costs £799 with 64GB, and the 5.8in iPhone X costs £999 with 64GB.

In the last three years, Huawei’s Honor has made a name for itself with excellent phones that cost far less than half the price of top-end rivals. The Honor Play is another great entry in the line costing even less.

It’s well made and feels great, has a good screen, good battery life, reasonable camera, really great fingerprint scanner on the back and plenty of value-added features. It’s still running Android 8.1 Oreo, not the new Android 9 Pie, and lacks water resistance, but few smartphones in this price bracket have it.

The only issue is which of the three Kirin 970 Honor phones is the best, as they’re all competing with each other and pretty similar. At £120 less the Honor Play might take the crown from the Honor 10.

If you’re looking for a metal phone under £280 that gets more than just the basics right, the Honor Play should definitely be on your list.

177,Film,City of Joy: the powerful Netflix documentary where 'everything is about love',https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/04/city-of-joy-netflix-documentary-drc-eve-ensler-schuler-deschryver,2018-09-04T15:01:39Z,"How does one find joy amid unspeakable tragedy? Madeleine Gavin’s documentary City of Joy, about a community built around women who have survived horrific violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), gives us a glimpse at both an incredible injustice still occurring today, and how Congolese women are combating it with their own grassroots movement.

The documentary follows the beginnings of City of Joy, a center established in 2011 in the eastern region of the DRC to help women who have been victimized by the ongoing mining conflicts in the area. The center was set up by the Panzi hospital founder Dr Denis Mukwege, women’s rights activist Christine Schuler Deschryver and Eve Ensler, author of the Vagina Monologues and founder of V-Day. Schuler Deschryver is the director and works with staff to oversee day-to-day operations, while Mukwege serves as an adviser and Ensler helps to fundraise and raise awareness.

“Everything is about love at City of Joy,” Schuler Deschryver told the Guardian. She described how many of the women who first arrive at City of Joy associate being touched only with violence. “So when you hug her and tell her she’s beautiful, that you love her, that you will fight for her, suddenly she’s like: ‘Oh my God, I exist. I’m a human being.’ You see the joy that [the women] have and know what they’ve passed through. I think that’s one of the reasons I wake up every morning.”

A large, gated community within the city of Bukavu, City of Joy serves as a type of boarding school: the women stay there for six months, and during that time they focus entirely on healing. Ensler describes it as a “kind of spiral of love”: there’s a collective of social workers and “Mamas” who built City of Joy with their own hands, and they’re the ones who do the cooking and take care of the women. “The women have someone take care of their children so they can purely focus on their own recovery, on getting better,” said Ensler. “And they have every kind of class imaginable. I mean, they have from group therapy to learning their rights to self-defense to learning permaculture and agriculture to learning English. It’s a whole roster.”

This format was entirely determined by the Congolese women themselves. “Dr Mukwege, Christine and I spent weeks and weeks talking to the women and listening to stories,” said Ensler. “We started asking women what they wanted. What did they need the most, what would help them the most? And the majority of them said that they needed a safe space where they could heal. Where they could learn, where they could become leaders and do something to change the direction of the country.”

Eastern DRC is rich in the four most commonly mined conflict minerals: coltan, tin, tungsten and gold. Once processed, these minerals are sold to companies all over the world to make consumer products such as phones, laptops, cars and appliances. Coltan, in particular, is the integral ingredient that allows smartphones and electronics to hold a charge. Some of the companies that use coltan, and thus benefit from these conflicts, are Apple, Nintendo, Sharp, Nikon, Sony, Canon, Toshiba, Lenovo and Samsung.

The demand for these invaluable resources has led countless militia groups to vie for control of the mines, and this proxy war has created unspeakable atrocities in the surrounding areas, with many of the victims being women and girls. It’s almost impossible to accurately track the magnitude of this humanitarian disaster, but a study published in the American Journal of Public Health estimated about 48 women are raped in the DRC every hour. At his Panzi hospital, Dr Mukwege has performed reconstructive surgery on over 40,000 women who have been brutalized by sexual violence as a result of militia taking over their villages. In speaking to the Guardian in 2015, Mukwege called rape the “monstrosity of the century”.

Schuler Deschryver said the militia use “rape as a weapon” solely to “terrorize people”. This conflict has been raging since 1996; while the war that sparked these events officially ended in July 2003, both Ensler and Schuler Deschryver have seen little meaningful, lasting change from the world powers and multinational corporations that benefit from the sale of these minerals.

“You know, I think this is where I become like a crazy person, because it’s over 12 years later and Dr Mukwege, Christine and I have made the rounds to every person with power on the planet and it’s still going on,” said Ensler. “Nothing has changed. And then you start thinking like, OK, do the people of Congo matter to anyone? Do the women of Congo matter to anyone?”

There have been some attempts to audit the sale of conflict minerals. In 2012, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted a rule mandated by former president Barack Obama’s Dodd-Frank Act that companies registered with the SEC had to disclose the use of conflict minerals sourced from the DRC, and they had to submit their reports by May 2014. While well-intentioned, regulating the minerals did not successfully snuff out the violence or existence of various militia groups. Amnesty International published a study in 2016 that concluded that many of the companies subject to reporting requirements under Dodd-Frank were still “contributing to the funding of armed groups or fuelling human rights abuses in the DRC”. As late as March 2018, those same companies were still “trying to ensure” their coltan was ethically sourced, and just last year Donald Trump drafted an executive order that would suspend the Dodd-Frank rule entirely.

“I don’t think they want it to change,” said Schuler Deschryver. “They want to keep going on so they can just plunder Congo with no witnesses.”

It’s an endlessly frustrating situation, and the hope is that the wide release of City of Joy on Netflix will help people to realize how interconnected we all are – and how we should be demanding our own countries and corporations do better. “I think people are so surprised to find out how complicit we all are in these wars and in the rape,” said Ensler. “Because the fact of the matter is, every time a village gets ransacked, and every time a rape is used to get people to flee their villages, it’s so the village can be taken over because of the mines. And so we’re all part of this story, whether we know it or not.”

The women of City of Joy, meanwhile, continue to do the important work – healing themselves, healing each other and figuring out, hopefully, how to heal the country itself.

The key to this is teaching the women how to become leaders in their communities. “When we can we help [the women] realize their dream,” said Schuler Deschryver. “They have a mission: when they go back to their communities, it’s to spread the message and everything they learned at City of Joy. So now, we even have some women who are the chief of their village. Some of them are partners of V-Day to help recruit more women. Some are now directors of schools, and some of them, because they had communication classes, they’re at a local radio station. And they go and help the other girls … it’s amazing. It’s like we’ve created a whole network of women in solidarity.”

Since its inception in 2011, City of Joy has graduated 1,117 women. “When women arrive … many of them have been exiled because they’ve been raped. They’ve been marginalized and really live on the edges. And many come so bruised and so battered and with diseases and sickness,” said Ensler. “And when you see them six months later you can’t even believe it’s the same people. They’re just these radiant, gorgeous flowers that have blossomed and who are secure and competent.”

It’s difficult to see how and when the violence in the DRC will end, but that doesn’t stop the women from focusing on their goal of raising awareness, and demanding more responsibility and transparency from foreign entities. “For the war to end in Congo, I don’t know how,” said Schuler Deschryver. “I don’t know how this will end, but we will keep fighting, knowing we are fighting against giants and we are just little.”

And there’s hope that the film will inspire more to join the movement. “It’s really hard to get people to care about women in Congo, as you can imagine,” said Ensler. “And I feel so overjoyed that finally their voices and their stories are getting out. So it’s thrilling, and hopefully this will inspire people to wake up to not only what’s happening in the Congo, but also just to think about how we can create literal and metaphoric City of Joys everywhere.”

178,Opinion,"Even as Turkey pulls away, the west must hold Turkish people close | Elif Shafak",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/03/turkey-west-erdogan-democracy-civil-rights,2018-09-03T05:00:44Z,"Growing up in Turkey, every weekend I would gather with friends and family to watch a western. John Wayne spoke fluent Turkish back then, Clint Eastwood uttered his laconic replies in an Istanbul dialect. Those cowboy towns with their bleak landscapes might just as well have been somewhere in Anatolia, they were so familiar. When the US television series Dallas first came to Turkey it created a ripple of excitement that lasted for years. There would be no one on the streets in the evenings when it was being screened. We were a nation hooked on the saga of the Ewing family. My grandmother put a curse on JR, the scheming, sneaky oil tycoon – we all hated him with a passion. But we never saw him as an “American” or a “westerner”.

And that’s what strikes me most when I look back: the absence of anti-western, anti-European sentiment. Part of that is because Turkey, unlike Algeria or Morocco, has not been colonised. We have no collective memory of colonialism. In fact back then, Turks generally thought we were part of the west, part of Europe, even though most Europeans had yet to acknowledge it. That naive and optimistic Turkey does not exist any more.

Over the years my motherland has become increasingly isolationist, inward-looking and anti-European. Together with the government’s blatant authoritarianism there has been a rise in ultra-nationalism and religious fundamentalism. This has inevitably led to an increase in sexism and gender inequality. Violence against women has escalated dramatically, with a 25% increase in killings last year. At schools, on the streets, the next generation is subject to the rhetoric of reactionary ethno-nationalism and rightwing populism. The state of emergency following the attempted coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan may have ended – but there has been no return to normal.

Last week TRT, Turkey’s state-run TV station, announced that it would no longer broadcast cowboy movies. It is the latest development in the continuing Turkey-US row, which led Donald Trump’s administration to impose financial sanctions on its Nato ally. The measures sent the Turkish lira, already weakened by the AK party’s economic policies and Turkey’s anti-democratic turn, plummeting to record lows. In response, Erdoğan asked the whole nation to boycott US electronic goods. “If they have the iPhone, there is Samsung elsewhere. We have Vestel [a Turkish manufacuturer],” he said. The government has also asked people to convert dollars into Turkish lira. Throughout August, almost every day, pro-government TV channels and newspapers have informed us of the “exemplary citizens” finding ingenious ways to protest against America, and the west as a whole. A father in Adana, a city in the south, publicly burned his children’s US passports. An ultranationalist group demonstrating in the same city burned US dollars in front of TV cameras. Afterwards their spokesman said, “we will overcome this crisis. We will make the priest an imam” – a reference to the US pastor Andrew Brunson who had been kept in prison for two years and was then moved to house arrest. In Muğla, in the south-west, Ferhat Dolar applied to court to have his family surname changed.

The jingoistic hysteria is not shared by all Turkish citizens – these showy examples taking to the streets are clearly in the minority. But in a country where the opposition is censored and suppressed, it is people burning things and changing names who are covered by the media. Anyone who openly refuses to take part in the spectacle is called a traitor.

A massive cultural change is taking place, and it manifests itself in small everyday details. We are being pushed into an artificial tribalism and we are being told that ethnically, religiously and historically, we are completely distinct from the west. We will never be one of them. Culture has become the new battleground. Secularism fades as the number of religious schools rises; evolution has been purged from the new school curriculum; education has been reshaped along religious and nationalistic lines. Erdoğan has been explicit: he wants “to raise a pious generation”.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, brands Turkey anti-European. “President Erdoğan’s Turkey is not President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s Turkey any more,” he said. But Turkey’s slide into anti-westernism will have negative consequences for “us” and “them” alike. That is the challenge for European politicians – it does not only concern Turkey, but the increasing number of countries where democracy is either wobbly or wounded.

There has to be a new approach that is openly and unwaveringly critical of all authoritarian governments and their shameful record on human rights, democracy and freedom of speech. But at the same time we all must embrace the civil societies of those countries where people are struggling under the direst circumstances. For as much as Erdoğan and his ilk present themselves as mere spokespeople for the will of their people, we need to see the difference between the elite and the general population in undemocratic countries. Isolating these lands and pushing them away from western norms will only play into the hands of isolationists. The Islamists and nationalists in Turkey do not want the country to be part of the European Union – they only benefit from escalating tension.

And while this international drama plays out, Turkey’s journalists, human rights activists and civic leaders are put on trial, exiled or imprisoned. Osman Kavala, well-respected and known for his work for peaceful coexistence, is still in jail on baseless charges. Likewise the opposition leader Selahattin Demirtaş remains unlawfully imprisoned. Novelist and columnist Ahmet Altan has been sentenced to life without parole. Turkey has become the world’s biggest jailer of journalists, surpassing even China’s sad record.

On 25 August, the mothers’ vigil, a peaceful demonstration that has been organised every weekend for more than a decade to remind the nation of the hundreds of citizens who have “disappeared” under police custody, was dispersed by brutal police force. More than 20 people were detained. The Kurdish-majority HDP party co-chair Pervin Buldan said: “They created a country that is afraid of mother’s silent cries.”

Turkey is changing, sliding backwards in every way. Led by an undercurrent of government-sponsored chauvinism and xenophobia, it is sailing away from the west and away from Europe. But still, civil society resists. There are countless citizens in Turkey – women, students, minorities – whose voices we do not hear, yet they continue to passionately support and defend pluralistic democracy. They are still there. We are still there. This is what “the west” should not fail to see.

179,Technology,What's the best laptop for university under £600?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2018/aug/30/whats-the-best-laptop-for-university-under-600,2018-08-30T11:10:12Z,"It’s always a good idea to see if the university and/or department have any recommendations, discount deals or special requirements. This can be important for courses that use professional software, though I don’t expect history needs anything that won’t run on most laptops.

In fact, any mainstream machine should suffice for most undergraduate purposes. Just make sure it has at least 4GB of memory and a 128GB SSD or larger hard drive, with 64GB of eMMC storage being the minimum. Also, aim for a processor that scores at least 2,000 on PassMark’s list of CPU benchmarks.

More is better. If possible, double all those numbers. Don’t halve them.

In other words, avoid low-end netbooks with 2GB of memory and 32GB of storage, even if they are as cheap as the quite nice Asus VivoBook E203 (£139.98). Netbooks are fine for light use where you do almost everything online, but Microsoft Windows 10 and Google Chrome will soon gobble up all your free space.

A fast PC could be considered a luxury for a student, but it saves time – and the extra cost per week is relatively small over a three- or four-year course.

However, gaming could still be a problem. A £600 laptop will run games, but it won’t run AAA games at high frame-rates with all the graphical effects. In student flats, the best answer is usually a communal Xbox One or PlayStation 4.

Traditionally, students have used mainstream laptops with 15.6in screens. They are cheap and do the job. However, they are too bulky to carry around all the time, and tend to have poor battery life.

If your offspring wants to take a laptop to classes, it would be better to buy an ultraportable, or a convertible machine that doubles as a laptop and a tablet. There are plenty of cheap 2-in-1s and convertibles around but the powerful ones tend to be expensive.

Microsoft Surface Pros are good for students because they are very robustly made and work with pen input: you can take handwritten notes and annotate things. However, they are beyond your budget, and there’s no point in paying for extra functionality if your son wouldn’t use it. Lenovo Yoga and HP x360 laptops are more affordable alternatives.

You can also do quite a lot with a 6in smartphone and a small Bluetooth keyboard. Indeed, Android speech recognition is now so good that you don’t always need the keyboard. The smartphone also works as a note-taking camera, voice recorder and music player.

Refurbished laptops are a good option for students and may look less nickable than shiny new ones. Ideally, buy direct from the original equipment manufacturer, such as Dell Outlet, or from refurbishers such as Tier1Online, which sells ex-corporate business laptops. These are built to a higher standard than consumer designs. However, you won’t save much unless you buy quite an old machine. A third-generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon from 2015 could still bust your budget.

I often suggest Tier1Online because the company will upgrade most laptops. You can usually get 8GB or more memory or swap a hard drive for an SSD at extra cost. It also guarantees laptops for up to three years for a small fee.

In general, you should look at refurbished ThinkPads, particularly the X and T ranges. Dell Latitude and HP EliteBook laptops are also worth considering.

For more tips, see my earlier answer to the question: would a cheap refurbished laptop run Photoshop?

The best support option is a next-business-day on-site service from a supplier such as Dell or Lenovo. My son went through university with Dell’s on-site service and they came and fixed it both at home and at university. However, the cost varies. It can be cheap on desktops but expensive on cheap laptops that are more likely to break.

Bear in mind that you may have extra costs on top of the laptop. Students must have backup systems to avoid losing work – especially essays and theses that may take months or years to write. A portable hard drive is good for backups, though notes and essays can be saved online to Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive or other cloud-based services, and on handy USB thumb-drives. I like to have three copies of every work file, on different media in different places, to guard against hardware failures, theft, and natural disasters such as fires, floods, lightning and meteor strikes.

Laptops have terrible ergonomics, so every student should also have an external USB keyboard and a riser for sustained work. Fortunately, standard keyboards are cheap, though gaming and split ergonomic keyboards are better.

It’s also not much fun working on a small screen with Windows’ standard resolution of 1,366 x 768 pixels (aka HD). Think about adding a cheap 1,920 x 1,080 (Full HD) Samsung, Dell or similar 24in monitor to go with the external keyboard. Movies will look much better, too.

Lenovo’s IdeaPad 3xx machines have recently been good choices, being better than the entry-level 1xx versions and cheaper than the more upmarket 5xx models. Today it looks as though the popular 320 and 320S are making way for the 330 and 330S so you may get an older one for less. Prices vary depending on the processor, memory, storage and screen size, but most fall within your price range.

Currys PC World is selling the 15.6in IdeaPad 330S with an AMD Ryzen 5 2500U (PassMark 7,516), 8GB of memory, a 265GB SSD and Full HD screen for £599. This is overkill for a history student, but the Ryzen 5 has Vega graphics that make it better for gaming. However, at this price level you should bust your budget and get the smaller, nicer 14in IdeaPad 530S for £629.

These laptops don’t have touch screens and don’t double as tablets. You’d get those features with a 14in Lenovo Yoga 520, which has a Core i5-8250U processor (PassMark 7,678), 8GB of memory, a 128GB SSD and a fold-back Full HD touchscreen for £579.98. (Shockingly, Currys’ 14in HP Pavilion x360 – which I otherwise like – only has a 1366 x 768-pixel screen for £589.97.) However, these machines are not as good for gaming.

Check the screen and keyboard quality in store and try other retailers – such as John Lewis, Argos and local shops – for possible alternatives. The HP Pavilion and Envy, Acer Swift and Asus ZenBook ranges may have laptops with your target specs.

You can save money by looking for the same or similar laptops with less memory and/or cheaper but slower processors. The market is moving to Intel’s eighth generation of the Core design, so laptops with older Core i3-6xxx and i3-7xxx chips can be good value. For example, Currys PC World has the IdeaPad 320S-14IKB with a Core i3-7100U (PassMark 3,816), 4GB of memory, a 128GB SSD and a 1366 x 768 screen for £379.98.

Laptops with new Intel Pentium Gold 4415U (PassMark 3,168) and Pentium Silver N5000 (PassMark 2,434) processors are also worth considering. The Gold 4415U is almost as good as a Core i3-7100U. The N5000 is a bit better than the old N4200 (PassMark 2,017) and about as slow as I would very unwillingly go.

An IdeaPad 320S-14IKB with a Pentium Gold 4415U should be a perfectly good history student system for £299.98 – half your budget. Alternatively, you could order the latest 330S version from Lenovo’s website for £349.99 and buy the on-site service.

Either way, avoid the new Celeron N4000 chip (PassMark 1,435). Buying an IdeaPad 330-141GM with an N4000 for £279.99 would be a terrible way to save £20.

180,Technology,Franken-algorithms: the deadly consequences of unpredictable code,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/29/coding-algorithms-frankenalgos-program-danger,2018-08-30T05:00:48Z,"The 18th of March 2018, was the day tech insiders had been dreading. That night, a new moon added almost no light to a poorly lit four-lane road in Tempe, Arizona, as a specially adapted Uber Volvo XC90 detected an object ahead. Part of the modern gold rush to develop self-driving vehicles, the SUV had been driving autonomously, with no input from its human backup driver, for 19 minutes. An array of radar and light-emitting lidar sensors allowed onboard algorithms to calculate that, given their host vehicle’s steady speed of 43mph, the object was six seconds away – assuming it remained stationary. But objects in roads seldom remain stationary, so more algorithms crawled a database of recognizable mechanical and biological entities, searching for a fit from which this one’s likely behavior could be inferred.

At first the computer drew a blank; seconds later, it decided it was dealing with another car, expecting it to drive away and require no special action. Only at the last second was a clear identification found – a woman with a bike, shopping bags hanging confusingly from handlebars, doubtless assuming the Volvo would route around her as any ordinary vehicle would. Barred from taking evasive action on its own, the computer abruptly handed control back to its human master, but the master wasn’t paying attention. Elaine Herzberg, aged 49, was struck and killed, leaving more reflective members of the tech community with two uncomfortable questions: was this algorithmic tragedy inevitable? And how used to such incidents would we, should we, be prepared to get?

“In some ways we’ve lost agency. When programs pass into code and code passes into algorithms and then algorithms start to create new algorithms, it gets farther and farther from human agency. Software is released into a code universe which no one can fully understand.”

If these words sound shocking, they should, not least because Ellen Ullman, in addition to having been a distinguished professional programmer since the 1970s, is one of the few people to write revealingly about the process of coding. There’s not much she doesn’t know about software in the wild.

“People say, ‘Well, what about Facebook – they create and use algorithms and they can change them.’ But that’s not how it works. They set the algorithms off and they learn and change and run themselves. Facebook intervene in their running periodically, but they really don’t control them. And particular programs don’t just run on their own, they call on libraries, deep operating systems and so on ...”

What is an algorithm?

Few subjects are more constantly or fervidly discussed right now than algorithms. But what is an algorithm? In fact, the usage has changed in interesting ways since the rise of the internet – and search engines in particular – in the mid-1990s. At root, an algorithm is a small, simple thing; a rule used to automate the treatment of a piece of data. If a happens, then do b; if not, then do c. This is the “if/then/else” logic of classical computing. If a user claims to be 18, allow them into the website; if not, print “Sorry, you must be 18 to enter”. At core, computer programs are bundles of such algorithms. Recipes for treating data. On the micro level, nothing could be simpler. If computers appear to be performing magic, it’s because they are fast, not intelligent.

Recent years have seen a more portentous and ambiguous meaning emerge, with the word “algorithm” taken to mean any large, complex decision-making software system; any means of taking an array of input – of data – and assessing it quickly, according to a given set of criteria (or “rules”). This has revolutionized areas of medicine, science, transport, communication, making it easy to understand the utopian view of computing that held sway for many years. Algorithms have made our lives better in myriad ways.

Only since 2016 has a more nuanced consideration of our new algorithmic reality begun to take shape. If we tend to discuss algorithms in almost biblical terms, as independent entities with lives of their own, it’s because we have been encouraged to think of them in this way. Corporations like Facebook and Google have sold and defended their algorithms on the promise of objectivity, an ability to weigh a set of conditions with mathematical detachment and absence of fuzzy emotion. No wonder such algorithmic decision-making has spread to the granting of loans/ bail/benefits/college places/job interviews and almost anything requiring choice.

We no longer accept the sales pitch for this type of algorithm so meekly. In her 2016 book Weapons of Math Destruction, Cathy O’Neil, a former math prodigy who left Wall Street to teach and write and run the excellent mathbabe blog, demonstrated beyond question that, far from eradicating human biases, algorithms could magnify and entrench them. After all, software is written by overwhelmingly affluent white and Asian men – and it will inevitably reflect their assumptions (Google “racist soap dispenser” to see how this plays out in even mundane real-world situations). Bias doesn’t require malice to become harm, and unlike a human being, we can’t easily ask an algorithmic gatekeeper to explain its decision. O’Neil called for “algorithmic audits” of any systems directly affecting the public, a sensible idea that the tech industry will fight tooth and nail, because algorithms are what the companies sell; the last thing they will volunteer is transparency.

The good news is that this battle is under way. The bad news is that it’s already looking quaint in relation to what comes next. So much attention has been focused on the distant promises and threats of artificial intelligence, AI, that almost no one has noticed us moving into a new phase of the algorithmic revolution that could be just as fraught and disorienting – with barely a question asked.

The algorithms flagged by O’Neil and others are opaque but predictable: they do what they’ve been programmed to do. A skilled coder can in principle examine and challenge their underpinnings. Some of us dream of a citizen army to do this work, similar to the network of amateur astronomers who support professionals in that field. Legislation to enable this seems inevitable.

We might call these algorithms “dumb”, in the sense that they’re doing their jobs according to parameters defined by humans. The quality of result depends on the thought and skill with which they were programmed. At the other end of the spectrum is the more or less distant dream of human-like artificial general intelligence, or AGI. A properly intelligent machine would be able to question the quality of its own calculations, based on something like our own intuition (which we might think of as a broad accumulation of experience and knowledge). To put this into perspective, Google’s DeepMind division has been justly lauded for creating a program capable of mastering arcade games, starting with nothing more than an instruction to aim for the highest possible score. This technique is called “reinforcement learning” and works because a computer can play millions of games quickly in order to learn what generates points. Some call this form of ability “artificial narrow intelligence”, but here the word “intelligent” is being used much as Facebook uses “friend” – to imply something safer and better understood than it is. Why? Because the machine has no context for what it’s doing and can’t do anything else. Neither, crucially, can it transfer knowledge from one game to the next (so-called “transfer learning”), which makes it less generally intelligent than a toddler, or even a cuttlefish. We might as well call an oil derrick or an aphid “intelligent”. Computers are already vastly superior to us at certain specialized tasks, but the day they rival our general ability is probably some way off – if it ever happens. Human beings may not be best at much, but we’re second-best at an impressive range of things.

Here’s the problem. Between the “dumb” fixed algorithms and true AI lies the problematic halfway house we’ve already entered with scarcely a thought and almost no debate, much less agreement as to aims, ethics, safety, best practice. If the algorithms around us are not yet intelligent, meaning able to independently say “that calculation/course of action doesn’t look right: I’ll do it again”, they are nonetheless starting to learn from their environments. And once an algorithm is learning, we no longer know to any degree of certainty what its rules and parameters are. At which point we can’t be certain of how it will interact with other algorithms, the physical world, or us. Where the “dumb” fixed algorithms – complex, opaque and inured to real time monitoring as they can be – are in principle predictable and interrogable, these ones are not. After a time in the wild, we no longer know what they are: they have the potential to become erratic. We might be tempted to call these “frankenalgos” – though Mary Shelley couldn’t have made this up.

These algorithms are not new in themselves. I first encountered them almost five years ago while researching a piece for the Guardian about high frequency trading (HFT) on the stock market. What I found was extraordinary: a human-made digital ecosystem, distributed among racks of black boxes crouched like ninjas in billion-dollar data farms – which is what stock markets had become. Where once there had been a physical trading floor, all action had devolved to a central server, in which nimble, predatory algorithms fed off lumbering institutional ones, tempting them to sell lower and buy higher by fooling them as to the state of the market. Human HFT traders (although no human actively traded any more) called these large, slow participants “whales”, and they mostly belonged to mutual and pension funds – ie the public. For most HFT shops, whales were now the main profit source. In essence, these algorithms were trying to outwit each other; they were doing invisible battle at the speed of light, placing and cancelling the same order 10,000 times per second or slamming so many into the system that the whole market shook – all beyond the oversight or control of humans.

No one could be surprised that this situation was unstable. A “flash crash” had occurred in 2010, during which the market went into freefall for five traumatic minutes, then righted itself over another five – for no apparent reason. I travelled to Chicago to see a man named Eric Hunsader, whose prodigious programming skills allowed him to see market data in far more detail than regulators, and he showed me that by 2014, “mini flash crashes” were happening every week. Even he couldn’t prove exactly why, but he and his staff had begun to name some of the “algos” they saw, much as crop circle hunters named the formations found in English summer fields, dubbing them “Wild Thing”, “Zuma”, “The Click” or “Disruptor”.

Neil Johnson, a physicist specializing in complexity at George Washington University, made a study of stock market volatility. “It’s fascinating,” he told me. “I mean, people have talked about the ecology of computer systems for years in a vague sense, in terms of worm viruses and so on. But here’s a real working system that we can study. The bigger issue is that we don’t know how it’s working or what it could give rise to. And the attitude seems to be ‘out of sight, out of mind’.”

Significantly, Johnson’s paper on the subject was published in the journal Nature and described the stock market in terms of “an abrupt system-wide transition from a mixed human-machine phase to a new all-machine phase characterized by frequent black swan [ie highly unusual] events with ultrafast durations”. The scenario was complicated, according to the science historian George Dyson, by the fact that some HFT firms were allowing the algos to learn – “just letting the black box try different things, with small amounts of money, and if it works, reinforce those rules. We know that’s been done. Then you actually have rules where nobody knows what the rules are: the algorithms create their own rules – you let them evolve the same way nature evolves organisms.” Non-finance industry observers began to postulate a catastrophic global “splash crash”, while the fastest-growing area of the market became (and remains) instruments that profit from volatility. In his 2011 novel The Fear Index, Robert Harris imagines the emergence of AGI – of the Singularity, no less – from precisely this digital ooze. To my surprise, no scientist I spoke to would categorically rule out such a possibility.

All of which could be dismissed as high finance arcana, were it not for a simple fact. Wisdom used to hold that technology was adopted first by the porn industry, then by everyone else. But the 21st century’s porn is finance, so when I thought I saw signs of HFT-like algorithms causing problems elsewhere, I called Neil Johnson again.

“You’re right on point,” he told me: a new form of algorithm is moving into the world, which has “the capability to rewrite bits of its own code”, at which point it becomes like “a genetic algorithm”. He thinks he saw evidence of them on fact-finding forays into Facebook (“I’ve had my accounts attacked four times,” he adds). If so, algorithms are jousting there, and adapting, as on the stock market. “After all, Facebook is just one big algorithm,” Johnson says.

“And I think that’s exactly the issue Facebook has. They can have simple algorithms to recognize my face in a photo on someone else’s page, take the data from my profile and link us together. That’s a very simple concrete algorithm. But the question is what is the effect of billions of such algorithms working together at the macro level? You can’t predict the learned behavior at the level of the population from microscopic rules. So Facebook would claim that they know exactly what’s going on at the micro level, and they’d probably be right. But what happens at the level of the population? That’s the issue.”

To underscore this point, Johnson and a team of colleagues from the University of Miami and Notre Dame produced a paper, Emergence of Extreme Subpopulations from Common Information and Likely Enhancement from Future Bonding Algorithms, purporting to mathematically prove that attempts to connect people on social media inevitably polarize society as a whole. He thinks Facebook and others should model (or be made to model) the effects of their algorithms in the way climate scientists model climate change or weather patterns.

O’Neil says she consciously excluded this adaptive form of algorithm from Weapons of Math Destruction. In a convoluted algorithmic environment where nothing is clear, apportioning responsibility to particular segments of code becomes extremely difficult. This makes them easier to ignore or dismiss, because they and their precise effects are harder to identify, she explains, before advising that if I want to see them in the wild, I should ask what a flash crash on Amazon might look like.

“I’ve been looking out for these algorithms, too,” she says, “and I’d been thinking: ‘Oh, big data hasn’t gotten there yet.’ But more recently a friend who’s a bookseller on Amazon has been telling me how crazy the pricing situation there has become for people like him. Every so often you will see somebody tweet ‘Hey, you can buy a luxury yarn on Amazon for $40,000.’ And whenever I hear that kind of thing, I think: ‘Ah! That must be the equivalent of a flash crash!’”

Anecdotal evidence of anomalous events on Amazon is plentiful, in the form of threads from bemused sellers, and at least one academic paper from 2016, which claims: “Examples have emerged of cases where competing pieces of algorithmic pricing software interacted in unexpected ways and produced unpredictable prices, as well as cases where algorithms were intentionally designed to implement price fixing.” The problem, again, is how to apportion responsibility in a chaotic algorithmic environment where simple cause and effect either doesn’t apply or is nearly impossible to trace. As in finance, deniability is baked into the system.

Where safety is at stake, this really matters. When a driver ran off the road and was killed in a Toyota Camry after appearing to accelerate wildly for no obvious reason, Nasa experts spent six months examining the millions of lines of code in its operating system, without finding evidence for what the driver’s family believed had occurred, but the manufacturer steadfastly denied – that the car had accelerated of its own accord. Only when a pair of embedded software experts spent 20 months digging into the code were they able to prove the family’s case, revealing a twisted mass of what programmers call “spaghetti code”, full of algorithms that jostled and fought, generating anomalous, unpredictable output. The autonomous cars currently being tested may contain 100m lines of code and, given that no programmer can anticipate all possible circumstances on a real-world road, they have to learn and receive constant updates. How do we avoid clashes in such a fluid code milieu, not least when the algorithms may also have to defend themselves from hackers?

Twenty years ago, George Dyson anticipated much of what is happening today in his classic book Darwin Among the Machines. The problem, he tells me, is that we’re building systems that are beyond our intellectual means to control. We believe that if a system is deterministic (acting according to fixed rules, this being the definition of an algorithm) it is predictable – and that what is predictable can be controlled. Both assumptions turn out to be wrong.

“It’s proceeding on its own, in little bits and pieces,” he says. “What I was obsessed with 20 years ago that has completely taken over the world today are multicellular, metazoan digital organisms, the same way we see in biology, where you have all these pieces of code running on people’s iPhones, and collectively it acts like one multicellular organism.

“There’s this old law called Ashby’s law that says a control system has to be as complex as the system it’s controlling, and we’re running into that at full speed now, with this huge push to build self-driving cars where the software has to have a complete model of everything, and almost by definition we’re not going to understand it. Because any model that we understand is gonna do the thing like run into a fire truck ’cause we forgot to put in the fire truck.”

Unlike our old electro-mechanical systems, these new algorithms are also impossible to test exhaustively. Unless and until we have super-intelligent machines to do this for us, we’re going to be walking a tightrope.

Dyson questions whether we will ever have self-driving cars roaming freely through city streets, while Toby Walsh, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of New South Wales who wrote his first program at age 13 and ran a tyro computing business by his late teens, explains from a technical perspective why this is.

“No one knows how to write a piece of code to recognize a stop sign. We spent years trying to do that kind of thing in AI – and failed! It was rather stalled by our stupidity, because we weren’t smart enough to learn how to break the problem down. You discover when you program that you have to learn how to break the problem down into simple enough parts that each can correspond to a computer instruction [to the machine]. We just don’t know how to do that for a very complex problem like identifying a stop sign or translating a sentence from English to Russian – it’s beyond our capability. All we know is how to write a more general purpose algorithm that can learn how to do that given enough examples.”

Hence the current emphasis on machine learning. We now know that Herzberg, the pedestrian killed by an automated Uber car in Arizona, died because the algorithms wavered in correctly categorizing her. Was this a result of poor programming, insufficient algorithmic training or a hubristic refusal to appreciate the limits of our technology? The real problem is that we may never know.

“And we will eventually give up writing algorithms altogether,” Walsh continues, “because the machines will be able to do it far better than we ever could. Software engineering is in that sense perhaps a dying profession. It’s going to be taken over by machines that will be far better at doing it than we are.”

Walsh believes this makes it more, not less, important that the public learn about programming, because the more alienated we become from it, the more it seems like magic beyond our ability to affect. When shown the definition of “algorithm” given earlier in this piece, he found it incomplete, commenting: “I would suggest the problem is that algorithm now means any large, complex decision making software system and the larger environment in which it is embedded, which makes them even more unpredictable.” A chilling thought indeed. Accordingly, he believes ethics to be the new frontier in tech, foreseeing “a golden age for philosophy” – a view with which Eugene Spafford of Purdue University, a cybersecurity expert, concurs.

“Where there are choices to be made, that’s where ethics comes in. And we tend to want to have an agency that we can interrogate or blame, which is very difficult to do with an algorithm. This is one of the criticisms of these systems so far, in that it’s not possible to go back and analyze exactly why some decisions are made, because the internal number of choices is so large that how we got to that point may not be something we can ever recreateto prove culpability beyond doubt.”

The counter-argument is that, once a program has slipped up, the entire population of programs can be rewritten or updated so it doesn’t happen again – unlike humans, whose propensity to repeat mistakes will doubtless fascinate intelligent machines of the future. Nonetheless, while automation should be safer in the long run, our existing system of tort law, which requires proof of intention or negligence, will need to be rethought. A dog is not held legally responsible for biting you; its owner might be, but only if the dog’s action is thought foreseeable. In an algorithmic environment, many unexpected outcomes may not have been foreseeable to humans – a feature with the potential to become a scoundrel’s charter, in which deliberate obfuscation becomes at once easier and more rewarding. Pharmaceutical companies have benefited from the cover of complexity for years (see the case of Thalidomide), but here the consequences could be both greater and harder to reverse.

Commerce, social media, finance and transport may come to look like small beer in future, however. If the military no longer drives innovation as it once did, it remains tech’s most consequential adopter. No surprise, then, that an outpouring of concern among scientists and tech workers has accompanied revelations that autonomous weapons are ghosting toward the battlefield in what amounts to an algorithmic arms race. A robotic sharpshooter currently polices the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, and while its manufacturer, Samsung, denies it to be capable of autonomy, this claim is widely disbelieved. Russia, China and the US all claim to be at various stages of developing swarms of coordinated, weaponized drones , while the latter plans missiles able to hover over a battlefield for days, observing, before selecting their own targets. A group of Google employees resigned over and thousands more questioned the tech monolith’s provision of machine learning software to the Pentagon’s Project Maven “algorithmic warfare” program – concerns to which management eventually responded, agreeing not to renew the Maven contract and to publish a code of ethics for the use of its algorithms. At time of writing, competitors including Amazon and Microsoft have resisted following suit.

In common with other tech firms, Google had claimed moral virtue for its Maven software: that it would help choose targets more efficiently and thereby save lives. The question is how tech managers can presume to know what their algorithms will do or be directed to do in situ – especially given the certainty that all sides will develop adaptive algorithmic counter-systems designed to confuse enemy weapons. As in the stock market, unpredictability is likely to be seen as an asset rather than handicap, giving weapons a better chance of resisting attempts to subvert them. In this and other ways we risk in effect turning our machines inside out, wrapping our everyday corporeal world in spaghetti code.

Lucy Suchman of Lancaster University in the UK co-authored an open letter from technology researchers to Google, asking them to reflect on the rush to militarize their work. Tech firms’ motivations are easy to fathom, she says: military contracts have always been lucrative. For the Pentagon’s part, a vast network of sensors and surveillance systems has run ahead of any ability to use the screeds of data so acquired.

“They are overwhelmed by data, because they have new means to collect and store it, but they can’t process it. So it’s basically useless – unless something magical happens. And I think their recruitment of big data companies is a form of magical thinking in the sense of: ‘Here is some magic technology that will make sense of all this.’”

Suchman also offers statistics that shed chilling light on Maven. According to analysis carried out on drone attacks in Pakistan from 2003-13, fewer than 2% of people killed in this way are confirmable as “high value” targets presenting a clear threat to the United States. In the region of 20% are held to be non-combatants, leaving more than 75% unknown. Even if these figures were out by a factor of two – or three, or four – they would give any reasonable person pause.

“So here we have this very crude technology of identification and what Project Maven proposes to do is automate that. At which point it becomes even less accountable and open to questioning. It’s a really bad idea.”

Suchman’s colleague Lilly Irani, at the University of California, San Diego, reminds us that information travels around an algorithmic system at the speed of light, free of human oversight. Technical discussions are often used as a smokescreen to avoid responsibility, she suggests.

“When we talk about algorithms, sometimes what we’re talking about is bureaucracy. The choices algorithm designers and policy experts make are presented as objective, where in the past someone would have had to take responsibility for them. Tech companies say they’re only improving accuracy with Maven – ie the right people will be killed rather than the wrong ones – and in saying that, the political assumption that those people on the other side of the world are more killable, and that the US military gets to define what suspicion looks like, go unchallenged. So technology questions are being used to close off some things that are actually political questions. The choice to use algorithms to automate certain kinds of decisions is political too.”

The legal conventions of modern warfare, imperfect as they might be, assume human accountability for decisions taken. At the very least, algorithmic warfare muddies the water in ways we may grow to regret. A group of government experts is debating the issue at the UN convention on certain conventional weapons (CCW) meeting in Geneva this week.

Solutions exist or can be found for most of the problems described here, but not without incentivizing big tech to place the health of society on a par with their bottom lines. More serious in the long term is growing conjecture that current programming methods are no longer fit for purpose given the size, complexity and interdependency of the algorithmic systems we increasingly rely on. One solution, employed by the Federal Aviation Authority in relation to commercial aviation, is to log and assess the content of all programs and subsequent updates to such a level of detail that algorithmic interactions are well understood in advance – but this is impractical on a large scale. Portions of the aerospace industry employ a relatively new approach called model-based programming, in which machines do most of the coding work and are able to test as they go.

Model-based programming may not be the panacea some hope for, however. Not only does it push humans yet further from the process, but Johnson, the physicist, conducted a study for the Department of Defense that found “extreme behaviors that couldn’t be deduced from the code itself” even in large, complex systems built using this technique. Much energy is being directed at finding ways to trace unexpected algorithmic behavior back to the specific lines of code that caused it. No one knows if a solution (or solutions) will be found, but none are likely to work where aggressive algos are designed to clash and/or adapt.

As we wait for a technological answer to the problem of soaring algorithmic entanglement, there are precautions we can take. Paul Wilmott, a British expert in quantitative analysis and vocal critic of high frequency trading on the stock market, wryly suggests “learning to shoot, make jam and knit”. More practically, Spafford, the software security expert, advises making tech companies responsible for the actions of their products, whether specific lines of rogue code – or proof of negligence in relation to them – can be identified or not. He notes that the venerable Association for Computing Machinery has updated its code of ethics along the lines of medicine’s Hippocratic oath, to instruct computing professionals to do no harm and consider the wider impacts of their work. Johnson, for his part, considers our algorithmic discomfort to be at least partly conceptual; growing pains in a new realm of human experience. He laughs in noting that when he and I last spoke about this stuff a few short years ago, my questions were niche concerns, restricted to a few people who pored over the stock market in unseemly detail.

“And now, here we are – it’s even affecting elections. I mean, what the heck is going on? I think the deep scientific thing is that software engineers are trained to write programs to do things that optimize – and with good reason, because you’re often optimizing in relation to things like the weight distribution in a plane, or a most fuel-efficient speed: in the usual, anticipated circumstances optimizing makes sense. But in unusual circumstances it doesn’t, and we need to ask: ‘What’s the worst thing that could happen in this algorithm once it starts interacting with others?’ The problem is we don’t even have a word for this concept, much less a science to study it.”

He pauses for moment, trying to wrap his brain around the problem.

“The thing is, optimizing is all about either maximizing or minimizing something, which in computer terms are the same. So what is the opposite of an optimization, ie the least optimal case, and how do we identify and measure it? The question we need to ask, which we never do, is: ‘What’s the most extreme possible behavior in a system I thought I was optimizing?’”

Another brief silence ends with a hint of surprise in his voice.

“Basically, we need a new science,” he says.

181,Technology,Samsung Galaxy Note 9 review: the do-everything phone,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/22/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review-phone-bluetooth-s-pen,2018-08-22T06:00:50Z,"The king of the big, powerful phones is back for another generation, but is the new Samsung Galaxy Note 9 still the phablet to beat?

The Note series pioneered the big-screen smartphone in 2011 and over the last seven years it has been made larger and more feature-packed with each new version. Where the Galaxy S9 series is Samsung’s top-end phone for normal people, the Note 9 is the powerhouse for those that need the answer to the question “can I do that on my phone” always to be yes.

The Note 9’s screen is big - at 6.4in it’s 0.1in bigger than the last version – but it’s only actually a smidgen larger than that fitted to the Galaxy S9+.

Place the new phone next to the Note 8 and you’d be hard pressed to tell the difference, until you look a bit more closely. 



The bezels are slightly smaller and the aluminium band around the sides slightly more prominent. The dual-camera system now sits slightly proud of the glass back and the fingerprint scanner has been moved from alongside the cameras to below them. It’s a tiny change but makes a huge difference for usability.

The screen is the best you can get on a smartphone, with bright, bold colours, inky blacks and great viewing angles. The Note has always been Samsung’s showcase for its best screen technology.

The massive screen does have its downsides, though, as it makes the Note 9 fairly difficult to handle without two hands. If any phone would benefit from a ring or finger grip on the back, this is it. Samsung should have included a hand strap like the ones that came with phones in the early 2000s. It could sit next to the headphone jack.

Like the Galaxy S9, the Note 9 has a different processor, depending on where you buy it. The European model has Samsung’s own Exynos 9810 chip and was the version tested, while the North American model has Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845 processor, which is used in the OnePlus 6 and other top-end phones released in 2018. Performance should be similar between the two versions, although there may be discrepancies at the extremes.

The Note 9 is arguably the best performing Android device on the market, and is capable of maintaining that maximum performance for much longer without overheating, which was very noticeable in Shadowgun Legends compared with a Pixel 2XL or OnePlus 6.

Its performance as a desktop computer using Samsung’s DeX system, connecting the phone to a monitor via a standard USB-C to HDMI cable, was surprisingly good. Chrome viewed on a 1080p monitor handled very large and demanding web apps better than most cheap PCs.

Battery life was solid, but somewhat disappointing given the large 4,000mAh capacity battery, matching the performance of the Galaxy S9+, which has a 12.5% smaller capacity battery. With the screen set to its maximum resolution of QHD+ the battery lasted an average of 25 hours between charges or an hour longer with the screen set to FHD+ resolution.

That was while using the Note 9 as my primary device with the always-on display active, while browsing and using apps for five hours with well over a hundred notifications, reading comics in Marvel Unlimited for 60 minutes, and listening to about five hours of music via Bluetooth headphones.

For comparison, Huawei’s 6in Mate 10 Pro can last two full days between charges under similar conditions. It’s possible that the North American version of the Note 9 with the Qualcomm processor may have longer battery life.

The Note 9 runs the latest version of Samsung’s modified Android called Samsung Experience 9.5. It’s based on Android 8.1 Oreo instead of the recently released Android 9 Pie, which is disappointing but not entirely unexpected.

It looks and behaves similarly to the Note 8 or Galaxy S9+ with Samsung Experience 9. There are a few useful additions for the stylus and large screen, such as the pop-out Edge apps, advanced split-screen multitasking and the ability to pop-out apps to run as windows over others – all features present in the Note 8.

On the whole the software on the Note 9 feels like Samsung’s best optimised yet, with smoother performance all round. It’s not quite as snappy as a OnePlus 6 or Google’s Pixel 2XL, but it feels as if Samsung has done a better job of limiting lag all over the system.

The dual-camera system on the back is the same as that fitted to the Galaxy S9+. Two 12-megapixel cameras, one wide angle with dual aperture and the other a 2x telephoto camera.

New for the Note 9 is an AI system for optimising scenes for shots, which worked fine when it recognised objects such as food and plants, but often created oversaturated images that look like they’ve been put through an Instagram filters. I turned it off and got better results. The AI is also meant to spot when the image is blurry or your subject has their eyes closed, but I couldn’t get it to alert me no matter how many shots of friends blinking I took.

Lacklustre AI elements aside, the camera is brilliant, capturing a rich amount of detail, even with the telephoto lens, and in a range of lighting conditions. Low light performance was excellent too, as was the 8-megapixel selfie camera.

Another new addition is a Bluetooth-enabled S Pen, which uses a supercapacitor to operate the S Pen away from the phone for up to 30 minutes or so. Slide the S Pen back into the body for a full charge in 40 seconds.

Other than the usual scribbling on screen, you can now press the button to trigger actions on your phone, such as taking a picture in the camera app, pausing music or presenting the next slide in PowerPoint. Hold down the button and you can launch an app too.

I didn’t find it overly useful, but I know that the feature has been on the wish lists of Note users for some time.
• None The Bixby button is still there and Bixby still isn’t great – it technically hasn’t even launched in the UK yet so we just get the US version
• None Both the phone and S Pen are water resistant to IP68 standards
• None To register a fingerprint you swipe down on the sensor once, but you must do so in the orientation you hold the device normally otherwise the results aren’t good
• None Intelligent scan, which combines face and iris recognition, works very well, but you still have to use your fingerprint for most apps
• None The screen is just about big enough to be a viable replacement for a 7in tablet, but you had better have big pockets
• None The stereo speakers are surprisingly loud and good

The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 costs £899 for 128GB of storage or £1,099 with 512GB of storage.

For comparison, the 6.2in Galaxy S9+ costs £869 with 128GB of storage, 6.1in Huawei P20 Pro costs £799 with 128GB, the 6in Huawei Mate 10 Pro with 128GB costs £699, the 6in Google Pixel 2 XL with 64GB costs £699, the 6.3in OnePlus 6 with 64GB costs £469, the 5.8in Honor 10 with 128GB costs £369, and the 5.8in iPhone X with 64GB costs £999.

If you need your phone to be able to do just about anything, the Note 9 is it. It has everything and the kitchen sink wrapped up into a massive powerhouse of a phone.

As you might expect that comes with a few compromises, the biggest of which is the sheer size of the thing making it quite difficult to pocket and handle. It also costs a lot, although not quite as much as Apple’s significantly smaller iPhone X.

The camera is great, the screen is amazing, the stylus useful and the myriad features don’t get in the way if you don’t use all of them. You can game for longer at maximum performance than other phones and even use it as a workable light desktop when hooked up to a monitor.

The battery life is good but should be better given the size of the cell, and launching after the release of a new version of Android 9 Pie but running last year’s 8.1 Oreo isn’t ideal.

The Note 9 really isn’t that much different than the Note 8, but is a huge step forward over older models. Note fans should be happy.

182,Technology,"I want to boycott US PC hardware, software and services. Is it possible?",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2018/aug/16/i-want-to-boycott-us-pc-hardware-software-services,2018-08-16T10:02:55Z,"You could certainly eliminate a lot of American products, but you might be giving up features without getting any ethical benefits. For example, more than a billion people already manage without a lot of American technology because they live in China or Russia. While I share your distaste for the Trump regime, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin are not exactly choirboys.



And while Trump is scapegoating immigrants, more than half of America’s top technology companies were co-founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants. Do you really want to punish them for Trump’s misdeeds?

It’s also important to remember that the US is a big place and most Americans don’t like Trump either. Most technology products come from companies based in California (Apple, Facebook, Google, HP, Intel etc) or the state of Washington (Amazon, Microsoft). Both voted against Trump by substantial margins.

Countries retaliating against American tariffs are targeting products from states that support Trump. For example, China’s list includes soybeans while the EU’s includes Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Levi’s jeans and bourbon whiskey.

Instead of boycotting technology products, boycott things from “red states”. The Financial Times suggests peanut butter, for example.

Most hardware is made in China, mostly by Taiwanese companies. Whichever brand of PC you buy, it was probably built by Quanta, Compal, Pegatron, Wistron, Inventec or Foxconn. Apple and HP are from California while Dell is from Texas. Asus and Acer are based in Taiwan. Lenovo is Chinese.

Better still, you could buy a PC assembled in the UK from a company such as Zoostorm or Chillblast, though most of the parts are still manufactured in China.

Intel microprocessors are American, but the company also makes them in Ireland and Israel, and it has several factories in China. Intel’s main rival, AMD, is American, but some of its manufacturing is done by TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor) or Korea’s Samsung.

Perhaps you could buy devices with ARM processors. That’s a British design – originally spun out of Acorn, which made the BBC Microcomputer – though Japan’s SoftBank bought the company in 2016.

It’s hard to avoid American operating systems: Microsoft Windows, Apple’s MacOS and Google’s Android are all American products. The BSD version of Unix, on which MacOS is based, is from the University of California at Berkeley.

While GNU/Linux is mostly American, at least the kernel was started by Linus Torvalds in Finland, though he moved to the US decades ago and is now a US citizen. Happily, there are some non-American Linux distributions such as Canonical’s Ubuntu. Canonical was founded and bankrolled by a South African, Mark Shuttleworth, and is based in London. However, Ubuntu is based on Debian Linux, which is American.

SUSE Linux was developed in Germany (Software und System-Entwicklung), taken over by Novell (American) and later sold to Micro Focus (British). It’s now being sold to EQT, a Swedish private equity group. However, it’s an enterprise not a consumer version of Linux.

Microsoft Office is obviously American, but LibreOffice has a European connection, even if little (if any) of the original code has survived. StarWriter started in Germany in the 1980s and appeared on some Amstrad computers. Sun Microsystems (American) bought Star Division in 1999, and the following year, made the code of StarOffice open source. This led to OpenOffice, which was awful. In 2011, OO was forked to create LibreOffice, which is better.

Kingsoft’s WPS Office is another alternative. Kingsoft is a Chinese company that offers free (with adverts), subscription ($29.99/year) and paid-for ($79.99) versions of a three-piece office suite that apes the Microsoft version.

You can also use Opera or Vivaldi, which are excellent browsers. Both were co-founded in Norway by Iceland-born Jon von Tetzchner, though Opera is now owned by a Chinese consortium. But like many alternative browsers, both Opera and Vivaldi are based on Google’s Chromium open-source code.

You can certainly switch to a non-American email service. For example, you could use GMX Mail, which is German, or Fastmail, which has its headquarters in Australia. Here WeGo does great maps. It was developed by Nokia, based on its takeover of America’s Navteq, and is now run from Amsterdam. Spotify music streaming is an easy option: it was developed in Sweden.



For messaging, you could use Viber, which was developed in Israel and is now run by Rakuten Viber in Luxembourg. The parent company is Japanese. An alternative is Line, which is run by a Japanese subsidiary of a South Korean internet company. For those with long memories, ICQ is still going. It was developed in Israel, sold to AOL in the US, and is now owned by the Russian internet giant, Mail.Ru.

You could try to replace Google search with the privacy-oriented StartPage. This was developed in New York as Ixquick then bought by a Dutch company. However, StartPage gets its results from Google. Alternatively, you could try Yandex, Qwant or Swisscows. Yandex is a Russian multi-national listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Qwant is French and, as you guessed, Swisscows is from Confœderatio Helvetica (CH). Both use Microsoft’s Bing for many searches, though von Tetzchner says Qwant is “the first European search engine that is building its own web indexing technology”.

Social networking is a harder nut to crack. You could use Vkontakte, which is Russian and also owned by Mail.Ru. You could use Taringa!, which was launched in Argentina and is popular in the Spanish-speaking world. You’d have plenty of options if you spoke Chinese.

The real problem is that even if you got past the language barriers, it’s unlikely that your friends and family haunt any of these social networks. They’re on Facebook and/or Instagram.

Behind the Great Firewall, Chinese companies have cloned or improved on American offerings. There are now three Chinese suppliers in the world’s top ten internet companies, with Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent being roughly equivalent to Google, Amazon and Facebook respectively. Their combined market capitalisation is approaching $1 trillion. However, they have relatively few users in the USA and Europe, except for Chinese students and tourists.

If you spoke Chinese, Baidu could replace Google. As well as running the world’s second largest search engine, Baidu offers a browser and toolbar, maps, a cloud service, a social network (Baidu Space), music streaming and many other services. It also has a virtual assistant (Baidu Duer) and a self-driving car project.

Alibaba is the equivalent of Amazon, eBay, and PayPal. It has two huge online marketplaces, Taobao and Tmall, plus AliExpress for international users. It also operates a payment service (AliPay), email, messaging, cloud and many other services.

Tencent is a giant conglomerate that started with an ICQ-style messaging service (QQ) and now runs WeChat, which is China’s do-everything app. Its offerings include a Twitter-equivalent (Tencent Weibo), a social network (Qzone), a search engine and a browser, a digital payment service (Tenpay), an online bank (WeBank), and China’s biggest music streaming service. Its gaming businesses include WeGame, League of Legends, and a home games console that also runs Windows 10.

Unusually, Tencent offers QQ International for international users. You can also download WeChat apps for Android and Apple smartphones, though recent user reviews suggest it might not be worth the effort. Tencent has some way to go if it’s planning to take over the UK.

183,Business,Turkey pledges lira support as President Erdoğan announces US goods boycott  – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/aug/14/turkey-crisis-lira-rupee-germany-growth-uk-unemployment-business-live,2018-08-14T20:50:24Z,"Turkey’s government has come out fighting today against the market turmoil that sent its currency tumbling in recent days.

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan raised the stakes, declaring that Turkey will boycott electronic products from the US. The Turkish president told an audience in Ankara that:

Finance minister Berat Albayrak also tried to restore confidence, pledging:



We will make all kinds of preparations, from A to Z.... You will see that our lira will become stronger.”

Albayrak also took a swing at America, saying that the US dollar had lost credibility after being used as a tool for “political punishment”.

Turkey’s environment minister also jumped on the boycott bandwagon, saying US products wouldn’t be used for Turkish construction projects.

After days of losses, the lira has finally caught a break. It has rallied by over 8% against the US dollar today, back to 6.3 lira to the $, from almost 6.9 on Monday night.

But the diplomatic rift between Turkey and the US hasn’t been fixed. The White House is still demanding the release of American evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson, who has been held since the 2016 coup.



Analysts argue that Turkey needs to take decisive steps to prevent the market mayhem continuing; eg, an interest rate hike, improved relations with America, and a strategy to lower Turkey’s current account deficit.

Ripples from the Turkish crisis pushed India’s rupee to a record low this morning, apparently forcing the Indian central bank to intervene in the FX markets. Over developing market currencies, such as the Mexican peso and the South African rand, strengthened though.



Britain’s unemployment rate has fallen to a new 43-year low, but wage growth remains disappointingly slow.

184,Technology,Facebook buys rights to show La Liga games in India,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/14/facebook-buys-rights-la-liga-spanish-football-games-india-barcelona-lionel-messi,2018-08-14T11:03:46Z,"Facebook has bought the rights to show Spanish top-flight football in the Indian subcontinent in the latest move by a US technology company into sports rights.

The company has signed an exclusive agreement to show La Liga games featuring Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and other stars for the next three years. The deal will allow Facebook to show all 380 matches for the new season, which starts on Friday, to users in India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, the Maldives, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.

Facebook will show the games for free to its 348 million users in the region, including 270 million in India. The company did not disclose how much it was paying for the rights, which cost Sony Pictures Network $32m (£25m) last time they were for sale in 2014.

Facebook and other US technology companies have been buying up rights to popular sports for streaming services. Competition from cash-rich US tech companies is a threat to cable and satellite TV broadcasters, which have used sport as a way to attract and keep customers.

Facebook pays about $1m a game to show 25 Major League Baseball games worldwide for no fee, supported by advertising. From next season in the UK, Amazon will bundle 20 English Premier League matches with its Prime subscription service. Sky and BT currently share the rights to show live games on TV.

Peter Hutton, Facebook’s director of global live sports, told Reuters its La Liga streams would be free of advertising at first but that it was considering its options. He said the La Liga deal was an experiment and not part of a land grab of sports rights.

“This is one deal,” Hutton told Reuters. “It’s not something that is a big threat to broadcast world.”

The deal is La Liga’s latest effort to expand its fanbase in India, where it opened an office in New Delhi in 2016.

Jose Antonio Cachaza, La Liga’s country manager for India, said: “This is the first step for us. We’re excited to see it and we want make it as successful as possible so we can unlock other territories around the world.”

India and the surrounding south Asian countries are a crucial untapped market for Facebook, which has hit saturation point in the US and most of western Europe. The social network already has over 241 million users in India alone – the largest single country user base for Facebook, exceeding its 240 million US users – but there is plenty of room for growth.

India’s population passed 1.3 billion people in 2017 and is expected to hit 1.5 billion by 2030. Meanwhile about 500 million people in India are expected to be internet-connected this year, in a country that is primarily mobile first and has relatively affordable mobile data.

Facebook has already had some setbacks in India as it strives to reach chief executive Mark Zuckberg’s goal of connecting “the next five billion people”. In a coalition with Samsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Opera, Nokia and Qualcomm, called Internet.org, Facebook launched its Free Basics service in India in 2015 with local mobile network Reliance Communications.

The service provided free internet access to select sites, including Facebook but excluding competitors. It was banned from India by the nation’s Telecom Regulatory Authority in 2016 for breaching net neutrality rules.

Since then Facebook has launched its Watch video on-demand service, Watch, in the US – a rival to Google’s YouTube and Netflix, it features original shows viewed through its site.

Facebook is said to be planning to launch Watch in India this year, according to a report from local news outlet The Ken, as a way to entice the other 250 million-plus internet-connected people in India on to its main social-networking platform.

Last year Facebook failed in its attempts to acquire the rights to Indian Premier League cricket with a $610m bid. The La Liga rights may make a suitable alternative vehicle with which to launch Watch in India.",0.9721,
185,World news,Life without evenings: the people left behind by South Korea's war on overwork,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/14/life-without-evenings-the-people-left-behind-by-south-koreas-war-on-overwork,2018-08-13T23:00:43Z,"Kim Jeong-cheol wakes up every morning at 6am to deliver packages to Seoul’s wealthier residents, and spends every night ferrying those same people home after a night out, ending his working day well past midnight. He also works at a cosmetics distribution company he runs from his home with his wife.



Kim is one of many in South Korea’s capital to have taken on extra jobs as part of the unintended consequence of a law aimed at capping working hours and giving people more free time.

On 1 July South Korea cut the maximum weekly work hours to 52, down from 68. But the new regulation intended to combat long hours in Seoul’s steel and glass office towers has backfired for many doing manual or irregular labour, with people flocking to poorly regulated industries and facing pay cuts.

Kim added his delivery job – for South Korea’s national post – after the new law meant more office workers went home early, reducing the number of driving jobs at night. Kim, who has three daughters to support through university, now works about 19 hours a day.

“We used to be a happy family, I spent a lot of time with my daughters and when I had some free time I read the Bible,” the 59-year-old said. “Lawmakers are just passing new laws which only benefit the powerful and wealthy.”

Kim, whose income dropped 40% after the law came in, is not alone. A woman who would give only her surname, Park, began working in a convenience store after she lost about 500,000 won ($445) a month due to the cap on working hours. A builder named Seo took a second job working as a type of unofficial bus service when hours were cut to comply with the law.

The National Assembly estimated that 150,000 labourers would face an average pay cut of 410,000 won a month when the law was passed due to working less overtime. About a third of South Korea’s labour force works in jobs with irregular hours, such as construction, driving, cleaning or convenience store clerks, according to government statistics.

In the 1960s, the nation’s economy expanded rapidly, turning a country still reeling from the 1950-53 Korean war into the 12th largest economy in a generation. It has produced national champions like Samsung, Hyundai and LG, massive conglomerates that wield significant political influence, but that achievement has come at the expense of leisure time.

South Korean workers have some of the longest working weeks among members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, behind only Mexico. Last year the average person worked 2,024 hours, or about 38.9 hours a week. The group of mostly developed economies does not include countries such as China and India, and developing countries tend to work more.

This gruelling work environment has been blamed for a host of societal problems, from a low birth rate to plummeting productivity. Chung Hyun-back, the family and gender equality minister, has called working hours “inhumanely long” and said they have contributed to the South’s rapidly ageing society.

But South Koreans still work about 340 more hours a year compared with workers in the UK and Australia – about nine additional standard work weeks – despite having relatively similar average incomes. They work about six additional weeks compared with counterparts in the US.

There is a strong case for tackling the culture of long hours. Working more than 50 hours a week causes a drop in productivity, according to researchers at Stanford University, and there was little different in output for employees who worked between 56 and 70 hours.

Despite hardships faced by workers paid by the hour, office workers have rejoiced at the new law. Some have long complained of a culture that expected employees to stay late despite a lack of work. Others say bosses would routinely assign extra tasks outside normal hours, leading many employees to procrastinate all day since they knew they had to stay late regardless of workload.

Seoul’s city hall cuts electricity to the building at 7pm on Fridays and some private companies broadcast reminders throughout the week telling people to go home earlier. Retailers and bakeries have reduced opening times by an hour in some cases and more aggressive tactics include CCTV cameras monitoring offices for stragglers and limiting hours when employees can use swipecard systems. Employers who violate the law face up to two years in prison and hefty fines.

“It’s very difficult to tell your boss or other people above you that you’re going home earlier than them when they’re still in the office. I even had to tell them that I was sorry to leave if I had plans,” says Jay Jung, 27, who works in hospital management. Beforehand, he typically did at least two to three hours of overtime a day. “The so-called ‘life with evenings’ is possible now because we can go home on time,” he adds.

But working-class people have largely mocked the new law for forcing them to take second or third jobs, saying: “Instead of a life with dinner, there’s a new life where you have to skip dinner.”

About 20,000 people have flocked to become on-demand chauffeurs since the new law passed, according to Kim Jong-yong, head of the Korean Association of Relief Drivers. Companies have lowered fares amid the influx of new workers, and Kim says he has been blocked by the largest app after advocating for workers rights.

All the fanfare about the cap on working hours has left Kim wondering: “Where are the legal protections for us?”

“The 52-hour law was meant to benefit all workers, however it’s only positively affecting people working in stable, high-paying jobs such as civil servants and people working in corporate companies,” he said. “Taking a second job is the only thing keeping these people off the streets, it’s a last resort.

“Their struggles are a reflection of how Korean society treats and values working-class people.”",-0.1464,
186,Games,Fortnite players using Android phones at risk of malware infections,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/aug/10/fortnite-on-android-phones-risk-malware-infections,2018-08-10T10:47:44Z,"Fortnite players risk becoming victims of malware infections on their phones, following the decision of developer Epic Games to bypass the Google Play Store in favour of publishing the game to its own website, security experts have warned.

The popular battle royale game, which is already available on PC, home consoles and iOS, is now available on select Samsung devices – and will be on other Android phones soon. But in an unusual decision, Epic Games won’t publish Fortnite to Google’s main Android App Store, instead hosting the app for download itself.

Unlike iOS, Android allows users to install apps downloaded from the internet, and even to install competing app stores altogether. But the option is disabled by default, and security experts have warned that this is for good reason.

“Epic Games’ decision to publish the Android version of Fortnite outside of the Play Store is a very poor choice for the security of their players,” said Rob Shapland, principle cyber security consultant at Falanx Group.

“Android devices are already far more susceptible to malware than Apple devices, with the greatest protection being to always download apps from the Play Store as these apps are screened for malware, which prevents most malicious apps from being installed,” Shapland added. “By encouraging users to download Fortnite outside of the Play Store, Epic Games leave their players vulnerable to malicious copycat apps being installed accidentally if they go to the wrong site.”

The threat of an attack isn’t hypothetical. Even before Epic announced that Fortnite would be coming to Android, the game was frequently used by malicious actors as bait to encourage naive users to install malware, hand over their payment details or simply watch adverts, said Sean Sullivan, a security adviser at F-Secure. “One useless app would prompt for installation of three additional apps.

“This sort of scenario is very discouraging. I would like to believe that young people will be more immune to scams – but the free-to-play app market and YouTube chaff is basically conditioning them to ignore best practices of any sort. They carefully vet nothing.”

As well as offering the immediate risk of malware infections, Epic’s decision risks undermining the general security of the Android ecosystem, Lukas Stefanko, malware analyst at ESET, said. “If the producers of other popular games follow Fortnite’s footsteps and start to bypass the Google Play Store, this could have a dangerous impact on the security of those playing the games on Android, as they would be far more vulnerable to installing apps from unknown sources, which could be malicious.”

Shapland concurred, noting that the move “normalises the behaviour of downloading apps from outside of Play Store, which can only lead to more malicious apps being installed in the long term”.

Google’s control of the Android app ecosystem has been a mixed blessing for the company. By acting as an effective gatekeeper, it has managed to keep a lid on malware on the platform, as well as guard against fragmentation, ensuring that most Android apps can run on most Android phones. But the company has also been found to be abusing its monopoly, leading in part to a multi-billion euro fine from the EU Competition Commission.",0.974,
187,Technology,Samsung launches Galaxy Note 9 with big screen and Fortnite,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/09/samsung-launches-galaxy-note-9-big-screen-larger-battery-bluetooth-stylus-camera,2018-08-09T15:30:11Z,"Samsung’s latest flagship Android smartphone is the productivity-focused Galaxy Note 9: a larger, longer-lasting version of its stylus-touting phablet.

Announced at an event in New York the Note 9 resembles last year’s Note 8, replete with glass front and back, curved edges and slide-out S Pen stylus.

The 6.4in Quad HD+ Super AMOLED screen is slightly bigger than last year’s model. The phone’s body is slightly thicker at 9mm and heavier at 205g, accommodating a significantly larger 4,000mAh battery, which Samsung says should provide all-day battery for the heaviest of users.

“The Note has always been our showcase for premium technology and industry-defining innovation, and Galaxy Note 9 is no exception,” said DJ Koh, president and CEO of IT and mobile communications division for Samsung. “Note fans are Samsung’s most loyal; we know they want it all, to get the most out of work and play, and Galaxy Note 9 is the only phone that can keep up with their busy lives.”

The Note 9 will have Samsung’s octa-core Samsung Exynos 9810 processor in the UK or an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 in the US, with a choice of either 6 or 8GB of RAM, depending on storage variant. The phone also has Samsung’s water cooling solution to help dissipate heat from the processor over extended periods to prevent performance drops associated with overheating.

The Note 9 will also be one of the first Android devices to be able to run Epic’s hugely popular multiplayer first-person shooter Fortnite, with exclusive access to the beta of the game for a limited period. The game has been available on Apple’s iOS devices since April, as well as traditional consoles and computers, and will eventually be available directly via Epic’s website for other Android devices. Fortnite is also now available on Samsung phones from the Galaxy S7 on.

The new and improved S Pen stylus, a selling point of the Note series, now connects to the phone via Bluetooth so that it can also be used away from the device, for activating the camera shutter or similar. It still fits neatly into the bottom of the phone, however, and comes in a range of contrasting colours depending on the colour of the phone.

A dual 12-megapixel camera system matching that on Samsung’s Galaxy S9+, including its variable aperture lens and a 2x optical zoom camera, is mounted in the back of the Note 9. New also is an intelligent camera system that uses AI to perform object recognition and detect blinks, notifying the user immediately if a shot is blurry or any other issues.

Below the camera is a repositioned fingerprint scanner which, like the Galaxy S9+, is now lower down the back and therefore should make it a lot easier to use.

Laura Simeonova, an analyst covering mobile phones and IoT for CCS Insight, said that while the Note’s hardcore, loyal fan base will see the new features as enticing, “Samsung will be wary of comparisons with the launch of the S9 portfolio and accusations of less underwhelming improvements on previous models.

“It remains to be seen whether these will be enough to impress those outside the fiercely loyal Note user base.”

The Note 9 will also be able to use Samsung’s Android-on-a-desktop mode called DeX, as with the Korean firm’s more recent top-end smartphones, but without the add-on dock, instead simply requiring a cable plugged into the bottom of the phone and into a monitor.

The phone will come in four colours: black, blue, grey and purple. It will ship with Android 8.1 Oreo, not the recently released Android 9 Pie, and it will be available with either 128GB of storage costing £899 or 512GB of storage for £1,099. Pre-orders start today and will ship on 24 August.

“Some of the new features such as the new version of Dex combined with the S-Pen’s remote control functionality for presentations, should continue to catch the attention of business users and enterprises beyond the Note’s current consumer base,” said Simeonova. “The device will be available from 24 August, which is likely to give it over a month before we see any new iPhones or the new Pixel devices from Google slated for October 2018.”

Samsung also launched an updated smartwatch, called the Galaxy Watch, and a smart speaker called the Galaxy Home powered by the company’s own Bixby voice assistant.

188,Technology,Android 9 Pie: everything you need to know,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/07/android-9-pie-google-new-mobile-os-everything-you-need-to-know,2018-08-07T10:49:29Z,"Google’s next version of Android finally has a name: “Pie”. It’s rolling out right now and is packed with new features, from extended battery life to new gesture navigation.

Pie marks one of the biggest changes in the way Android looks and feels in some years, with a more colourful interface, a collection of new movement animations and rounded edges on almost everything. Thankfully, it’s still as fast as Android Oreo, at least on Google’s Pixel smartphones.

When can I get it?

Right now, if you have one of the recent Google Pixel smartphones or the Essential Phone via an over-the-air update. Either wait for the notification to update or head to Settings > System > Advanced > System update and hit the “Check for update” button.

Others will have to wait for their smartphone manufacturer to deliver the update. Those with phones such as the OnePlus 6 that were included in the Android P beta programme over the last couple of months will probably see the update soon. Those with Samsung, Huawei or other mainstream manufacturer devices may have to wait some time to see the update on their phones.

How much does it cost?

Android 9 Pie is a free update for eligible devices – if you are ever asked to pay for Android updates, someone is trying to con you.

Google has introduced the biggest change to the way you get around in Android since the traditional three buttons of home, back and overview (recently used apps).

The new gesture navigation button occupies the same space as the traditional on-screen buttons, but the home button is now a pill-shape and it moves.

Tap it to go home, flick it up to see recently used apps, swipe upwards twice or pull it up further to get to the app drawer, or hold it down to activate Google Assistant. Youcan also drag it to the right to switch to the last app (similar to the double tap of the overview button) or drag and hold to cycle through recently used apps.

The back button still appears when needed, but the overview button has gone.

The gestures are not activated by default for now, which means to try them out head to Settings > System > Gestures and toggle the “Swipe up on Home button” option.

It’s a small change, but arguably the most useful. Now when you have rotation lock turned on to stop the screen rotating orientation accidentally, and you turn on your phone intentionally, a little button appears in the navigation bar.

Tap the button to rotate the screen from portrait to landscape or vice versa – perfect for those few times that you actually want the screen to rotate but not, say, when you’re lying down in bed.

Time on the left for screen notches

Android 9 Pie has moved the time from the top right of the status bar to the top left. It may not seem the most dramatic of changes, but it makes room for screen cutouts called “notches”, as found on the OnePlus 6 and Huawei P20 Pro, among others.

Google has decreed that only two notches may be used on one screen for it to be able to run its version of Android, so at least you won’t have to deal with one in each side of the screen.

Short of navigation gestures, Adaptive Battery is the biggest improvement to Android. Using systems developed by Alphabet’s AI-outfit DeepMind, Adaptive Battery learns an individual’s usage patterns and directs the power to only the apps you need at the time you need them for more predictable day-to-day battery life.

So far users of the Android P beta programme on Google Pixels have found an increase in battery life in the region of 20%, which bodes well for longer-lasting Android smartphones.

AI has also been integrated into Android Pie’s brightness control, so it will now learn from your manual adjustments – something you could be forgiven for thinking already happened.

Smart replies have been in several apps for a while, including Gmail and Google’s dedicated Smart Reply app. But now they’ll be pushed to more apps and accessible directly from the notifications for easy, one-button replies.

App actions is another AI-integration attempt by Google, which seeks to predict not only the app that you want at any particular moment, but an action from within that app too. For example, I normally play my Discover Weekly playlist from Spotify in the mornings, so when I open the app drawer at about 8am it’s right there as a suggestion for one-tap access.

Apple’s iOS has had a magnifying glass for text selection for ages – now Android does too. Tapping on a bit of text still selects it, but when you drag one of the text selection handles you now see a magnified box appear immediately above your finger to make fine grain selection easier, particularly with tiny text.

Google is revamping the way Android handles background apps to better protect user privacy. Starting with Android P, apps given permission for location, the microphone, camera and network status will no longer be able to access them when idle in the background. This means it will be harder for rogue apps to spy on users without their knowledge.

The changes follow a recent tightening of control over the running of apps that were made with Android Nougat and Android Oreo, primarily to prolong battery life and performance.

What happened to those smartphone addiction features?

While Android 9 Pie has been released, not all the features shown off by Google at its developer conference in May are fully baked yet. Two big new features have yet to arrive: Slices and Google’s Digital Wellbeing tools. Expect them to materialise in the Autumn for Google’s Pixel devices and later for other smartphones.

Slices displays information from apps directly within the Google search app, in a similar manner to the way Google displays snippets of information within boxes directly in web search results.

Examples include showing photos taken in Bali from Google Photos, when searching for Bali, or live prices and times to get you home from Lyft when searching for the app.

Google’s anti-smartphone addiction tools, collectively called “Digital Wellbeing”, are currently in beta testing for a select number of users. They include Dashboard, which shows you how much time you’re spending on your phone and in apps; App Timer, which allows you to set time limits for certain apps; a beefed up Do Not Disturb (DnD) function that silences both visual and audible alerts; and Wind Down, which switches on DnD and fades the screen to grayscale as bedtime approaches.

189,Games,Fortnite is coming to Android phones – but not through Google Play,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/aug/06/fortnite-is-coming-to-android-phones-but-not-through-google-play,2018-08-06T15:48:40Z,"Online shooting game Fortnite: Battle Royale will be available on Android phones this month, but it will not be available on the Google Play store, the official app store for Android devices. Instead, developer Epic Games will make the game available for download via a dedicated installer on its website, avoiding the 30% revenue share that Google would get to host the title on its Play store.



Epic CEO, Tim Sweeney, said the company “wants to have a direct relationship with our customers on all platforms where possible ... physical storefronts and middlemen distributors are no longer required. We believe gamers will benefit from competition among software sources on Android.”

Fortnite made its mobile phone debut on iPhones in April. But Android represents one of the fastest growing video game platforms in the world, with 2.3bn active devices and an estimated 85% share of the smartphone market. A majority of Android users download games and apps via the official Google Play store, which brought in $20.1bn in revenue last year.

“For any developer, going outside the established distribution channels and opting for a direct-to-consumer will be a major challenge, particularly on mobile where getting users to register and share payment details is an issue,” said Steve Bailey, a games analyst with IHS Technology. “The strength of the buzz around Fortnite means it should be able to overcome the hurdle of getting core users to download outside Google Play, but it will also need to ensure a smooth and trusted payment process.”

“Avoiding the ‘store tax’ is a part of Epic’s motivation,” said Sweeney. “It’s a high cost in a world where game developers’ 70% must cover all of the costs of developing, operating, and supporting their games. There’s a rationale for this on console, where there’s enormous investment in hardware and marketing campaigns in broad partnership with publishers. But on open platforms, 30% is disproportionate to the cost of the services these stores perform.”



The decision has raised concerns. There is the possibility of Android users inadvertently downloading the game from a fake site, thereby exposing themselves to malware. To access Epic’s installer, users have to switch off a function designed to protect against malicious downloads.

Epic has countered by pointing out that most handsets allow users to customise which sites to give access to, and the open market approach works on PC where there are various third-party stores available. However, other publishers point out that there are already third-party stores on Android – it’s just that most users don’t visit them.

“In most markets it would be brave to ignore Google Play,” said Patrik Wilkens, vice president of mobile at Spil Games. “The main disadvantage is that you make it much tougher for your game to be discovered. Amazon, Samsung and a number of other Android stores represent a fraction of the Android user base.”

It be could that Epic is eyeing a lucrative new market – China – where Google Play does not operate. Having been banned until 2015, games consoles are still struggling to gain a foothold in the country, but over 580 million people play mobile games. Epic Games is partly owned by the Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent, which runs its own highly successful Android stores, giving Fortnite access to a large user-base. Tencent also published Fortnite’s close rival Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds in China, where it’s proving to be a hit.

Meanwhile, there are rumours the Android Fortnite may launch as an exclusive on the forthcoming Samsung Galaxy Note 9 handset, to be announced on 9 August. “Epic will have been financially compensated for exclusivity on a platform that only represents a small share of the Android total user base,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, director of games research at IHS Technology. “From Samsung’s perspective, they are using games to position the Note product with key audiences in markets where competition from other Android smartphone companies is escalating.

“There are a cross section of ‘gamer’ smartphones already on the market targeting enthusiast gamers on mobile platforms. Mobile network operators are also positioning their offerings in the context of gaming, so aligning device marketing with this position makes sense.”

The success of Fortnite, which is free to download on consoles, PC and smartphones, shows no sign of waning. Released last September, the game is estimated to have made over $1bn in revenue. Over 125 million people have now downloaded the game.",0.997,
190,Television & radio,"Chicken Connoisseur Elijah Quashie: ‘Deep down, vegans want to be us!’",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/04/peng-life-the-chicken-connoisseur-elijah-quashie-deep-down-vegans-want-to-be-us,2018-08-04T05:59:33Z,"Elijah Quashie, better known as The Chicken Connoisseur and now star of new Channel 4 show Peng Life, is almost supernaturally calm. It’s mid-London heatwave with temperatures hitting 33C, everyone is packed into a hot room at Channel 4’s offices and sweating through their clothes, but Quashie sits perfectly still, wearing a coat – A COAT! (a cream-coloured Nike Windcheater as it happens) – and is not even breaking a sweat.

He’s not fazed by anything, from Star Wars actor John Boyega tweeting that he loved his YouTube series The Pengest Munch (“Wish I had this growing up! Lmaaooooooooo”) to the 175 boxes of trainers taking over at home in Tottenham (“I need to lose, like, 70,” he says).

In fact, the only thing that gets him heated is chicken – specifically, Nando’s. Unlike the Love Island rejects who beg the company on Twitter for its legendary Black Card, which gives VIPs free chicken, Quashie is not fussed and wouldn’t accept a card. “Nando’s? The last time I ate from there I vomited,” he says. “I got down to the bone, I was seeing pink bits, and then it all just came up. My body speaks for itself.” He was, however, travelling at 90mph in a Lamborghini on the set of Peng Life at the time.

Quashie started his YouTube series The Pengest Munch in 2015, which features detailed reviews of chicken shops in London, from the burger sauce to the seating to the construction of the burgers. Each episode, he visits a restaurant and order the same thing: chips, a chicken strip burger and wings. The worst crimes? Chips that don’t absorb the salt, wings that are pink near the bone and badly constructed burgers with “bare lettuce”, which will be rated “dead”, “problematic” “lacking” or a let down for the “bossman” (chicken shop manager).

The most charming part about his reviews (one memorable line: “The burger caught me off-guard, ’cos it was hench … but man definitely chewed on a bone”) is their earnestness – he genuinely loves chicken shops and just wants them to serve good food. And he doesn’t feel bad about giving bad reviews. “I don’t care,” he says. “If you put out food that doesn’t bang, that was your decision. And it’s my opinion. I have to keep the integrity of my palette.”

In 2016, his show went viral, and support from celebs including Radio 1’s Charlie Sloth led to TV appearances, getting flown to New York to sample the city’s chicken shops with A$AP Mob member Bari and more than 41m YouTube views. There’s a book, The Pengest Munch: In Search of the Nation’s 50 Favourite Chicken Establishments and he’s in a Samsung phone advert. And now he’s got his own show, Peng Life, where he’s joined by friends Nelson and Wilson to rate and review expensive haircuts, kebabs and watches. Celebs such as Jodie Kidd and Rachel Riley also appear, making you wonder: when was the last time Jodie Kidd ate at Chicken Cottage?

Clearly, the brand was the plan from the start. Calling himself The Chicken Connoisseur, Quashie started a limited company of the same name, and adopted a “look” in videos. “A lot of people when they go to restaurants, they’ll dress up in shirts and ties,” he says. “I thought when I go [to chicken shops], this will be something special for me, where I dress up in a shirt and tie. I liked the juxtaposition.”

It might seem as if he’s trying to highlight a class gap and pushing back on the snobby elitism of food critics going for £800 meals in Mayfair but, in his world, they simply don’t exist. He doesn’t read restaurant reviews or follow bloggers or influencers on Instagram. Restaurant critics Giles Coren and Jay Rayner are fans. Did he even know who they were when they Tweeted about him last year? “Nope, and I still don’t.” Savage. When he appeared on ITV News he was asked if he “ever imagined being a food critic”. He calmly replied: “Yeah, that was the plan from the beginning. If I start being a critic, I’m a critic.”

He is also unlikely to be backing Jamie Oliver or food campaigners worrying that chicken shops are fuelling the childhood obesity crisis. “It’s down to the parents,” he says. “When I was in school there were some hench guys and they [practically] lived at the chicken shop. I’m sure those kids are eating a lot more Haribo and Pringles and doughnuts than [from] chicken shops.”

And vegans? “Nah. Deep down, they want to be us! They’re making vegan chicken!” Nelson, his co-host, who is sitting in on the interview with twin Wilson, chips in: “The more vegans there are, the more meat there is for us. Keep going with the cause!” You can’t fault their logic.

Quashie started because a friend, Elishama Udorok, was doing a BTec (a vocational qualification at college) in media and “was into cameras and stuff. We’d always go to the chicken shop at lunchtime and come back and debate which one was best.” The series, he says, was made for “people like me, my friends, people who I went to school with”.

But taking a web series from online to TV is notoriously difficult – just ask Dapper Laughs. The more successful ones (Broad City, High Maintenance, People Just Do Nothing) worked because their creators retained a lot of behind-the-scenes control, while others failed because their niche audience (Miranda Sings) weren’t willing to follow them to TV. Quashie’s motivation when he started his YouTube channel, he says, was to be his own boss. And because of that, the move to TV sounds as if it has been a difficult one.

“It wasn’t the plan to go to TV. When Channel 4 approached me in April 2017, it was like, meh,” he shrugs. “But there wasn’t anything more pressing to do. At the time, I was thinking they’ve obviously seen and chosen me to host the show because they want what I have made on YouTube to be brought to their channel. That’s exactly what they explained it to be – but on set it was a different case. In the end, it turned out to be something I should have seen coming but I didn’t.”

While making The Pengest Munch, he and Udorok were in total creative control, but with Channel 4, “obviously there’s a director and a producer and they’ll have scripts and things they think they need to put in there, and I’m like: ‘Nah, you guys don’t understand how it’s going to look, it’s going to look better if I do it like this.’”

He adds: “It was a case of: ‘Boy you have to do this, this is what Channel 4 wants,’ and if this my job and I have to do it – all right.” He hasn’t seen the first show yet, he says. “I’m not nervous, but I just want to see what it looks like. From being on set and [the producer and director] thinking and talking differently [to us] … I’m not sure if they’re going to leave in the best bits.”

Whatever he thinks of the final product, could Peng Life become a hit, piggybacking on to a trend? Chicken shops have been co-opted by the mainstream in recent years: from rap shout-outs to YouTube series Chicken Shop Date and Drake, Kendall Jenner and Beyoncé endorsing Nando’s, chicken shops are inescapable. But restaurants are also disappearing as London’s working-class areas get gentrified. Chicken shops are becoming, well, Soho House Group’s Chicken Shops.

“Places like that, they can’t even make the same chicken – it doesn’t taste as nice. It’s just not worth the money. Everyone there, they could go to a regular little chicken shop, spend £8 and they’re feeding the whole family,” Quashie says.

“Chicken shops ARE the culture,” Quashie’s other co-host, Wilson, says, essential spaces for London’s teenagers to hang out. “They’re as well integrated into communities as a launderette or a dry cleaners,” adds Quashie. “No one makes them a big thing, but they’re always there when you need them. And at the correct ones – not the gentrified ones – for a couple of pounds, you get a pretty decent substantial meal and you can’t get that anywhere else.”

Quashie is strangely defensive about his age, which is a bit weird, like when your mum gets to a certain age and pretends to be “29 again!” every birthday. He won’t confirm it, saying it “isn’t a big deal. I could be 16, I could be 46. It doesn’t make any difference.” Clearly he wants to appeal to his core audience of teenagers on YouTube, but records at Companies House list his birthdate as May 1993, making him 25. While he looks incredibly young and could easily pass as a schoolboy, meeting him in person, and having interviewed hundreds of forgettable boybands filled with awkward, fidgeting teenagers, Quashie’s intelligent, fluent, carefully considered answers and steady eye contact is a dead giveaway.

Despite his success, he says he’s “not even close” to being a millionaire, but YouTube fame means that he now lives a bit like a budget Beyoncé. “I get seen and spotted everywhere, I can’t do the normal stuff,” he says. “Going to a shop or the post office and not getting hassled, that is a privilege I don’t have any more. It’s long. If I’m walking past a school, I get caught.”

Sometimes when viral stars get TV deals, the moment can pass before the show gets on air, but Peng Life commissioner Becky Cadman isn’t worried as he’s literally stopping traffic. “When you go out with Elijah, it’s pretty full on. I went to the barber’s with him and this dad who was driving opened the car door, got all his kids out and they were all wanting a picture with him.” She hopes that, as well as the “16-35 demographic”, parents will want to watch the show with their kids.

But his laidback attitude doesn’t always work: he was criticised in January 2017 when it emerged a rapper who appeared on the webseries had been jailed for assault and was on the sex offenders register. When asked about it, you’d think it would be a good moment for Quashie to distance himself or point out how certain corners of the media are determined to drag down the career of any young black male enjoying success. Instead, he keeps things vague. “At the end of the day, me and my friends still do what we do and we’re still successful with it. [A headline like that] doesn’t take anything away from a good episode.”

Even though he’s got his own TV show, Quashie says he doesn’t watch TV (apart from Match of the Day) and sees himself returning to YouTube as his next move. “Channel 4 wants to rope in my demographic – on to their channel and into TV again. But for me there’s not much reciprocating. I don’t expect pensioners to be like: ‘Boom, yeah, I’m going to jump on YouTube, set up an account and subscribe.’” He needs a new cameraman – Udorok has got a job at Unilad – and then he plans to go international. “I might take a trip around Asia or Africa,” he says. He’ll probably skip having a Nando’s at the airport, though.",0.999,

What did Apple have to offer?

With hindsight, the answer is obvious. The iPod looked cool: it had a sleek aluminium shell half the size of its competitors, and a physical scroll wheel that could zoom through the trademark “1,000 songs in your pocket”.

By 2003 Apple’s advertising agency, Chiat/Day, had come up with silhouette adverts to promote the iPod. The ads were almost too successful, turning the iPod’s white earphones into such a marker of desirability that the Metropolitan police blamed them for a 26% rise in street robberies in 2005.

The iPod revolutionised Apple’s fortunes, kicking off a five-fold increase in its share price over the following five years, and providing a gateway drug for winning round Windows users to its Mac ecosystem. But it also changed the company on a fundamental level, turning it from a computer manufacturer into a consumer electronics designer.

In January 2007, the company completed this transformation, announcing that it was changing its name from Apple Computer to Apple Inc. That same day, it also announced something else: the iPhone.",0.929,

Weaker domestic demand saw new orders fall and the rate of output growth slip to the lowest in 16 months. Interestingly though, demand from abroad hit a six-month high, implying that firms are still reaping the rewards of better global growth, despite the recent moderation in Europe.

But over coming months, life for manufacturers is unlikely to get any easier. The recent escalation in trade tensions is clearly a challenge, but increasingly the biggest headache for businesses is likely to be the threat of a ‘no deal’ Brexit. This scenario would likely see huge congestion at ports and disruption to supply chains. While we suspect the probability of the UK leaving without an agreement in March next year is relatively low, an agreement may not come until late in the day.

Until then, confidence could begin to fall as uncertainty increases – the latest PMI suggests the degree of positive sentiment is already at a 21-month low.

Having said all of that, today’s slip in the PMI is unlikely to faze Bank of England policymakers ahead of tomorrow’s decision. Representing around 10% of output, manufacturing is a relatively small part of the UK growth mix. Importantly, the recent data flow – particularly in the much larger service sector – has largely backed up the Bank’s view that the economy has regained poise after the weak first quarter.

For that reason, we think the Bank of England will increase interest rates this week. But the key thing to watch is what the Bank has to say on its next steps. In an ideal world, we think policymakers would like to hike rates again much sooner than markets are currently pricing (towards the end of 2019). But with Brexit uncertainty considerably ramping up, realistically we think the Bank will struggle to raise rates again before the UK leaves the EU next March.

After Thursday, we currently don’t anticipate another hike before May 2019.",0.2883,
193,Technology,Huawei beats Apple to become second-largest smartphone maker,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/01/huawei-beats-apple-smartphone-manufacturer-samsung-iphone,2018-08-01T11:40:28Z,"Huawei overtook Apple to become the world’s second-largest smartphone seller behind Samsung in the second quarter, the first time in seven years that any contender has managed to split the top two.

Multiple market analysts said that Huawei’s rise came as the slowdown in China, the world’s largest market for smartphones, eased, with growing market share in Europe. Huawei failed in its recent bid to launch in the US after government action against companies deemed a security threat.

Despite Apple being historically weak in the second quarter, analysts described the rise of Huawei as significant.

“The importance of Huawei overtaking Apple this quarter cannot be overstated,” said Canalys analyst Ben Stanton. “It is the first time in seven years that Samsung and Apple have not held the top two positions.”

Approximately 351m smartphones were sold globally in the second quarter, down 2% year-on-year due to market saturation, increasing prices, longer replacement rates, reduced mobile phone network subsidies and lack of feature and design innovation, according to data aggregated by the Guardian.

“Consumers remain willing to pay more for premium offerings in numerous markets and they now expect their device to outlast and outperform previous generations of that device which cost considerably less a few years ago,” Anthony Scarsella from IDC.

Samsung was worst hit by the slowdown of the big three, down 10% year-on-year selling 71.9m smartphones for a 20% share of the market. Huawei raced into the second spot selling 54.2m phones in the quarter, up 41%, for a 15% share of the market. Apple sold 41.3m iPhones, up 1%, for a 12% market share.

“The continued growth of Huawei is impressive, to say the least, as is its ability to move into markets where, until recently, the brand was largely unknown,” said Ryan Reith, programme vice president of IDC’s Worldwide Mobile Device Tracker.

Stanton said: “Huawei’s momentum will obviously concern Samsung, but it should also serve as a warning to Apple, which needs to ship volume to support its growing services division.

“If Apple and Samsung want to maintain their market positions, they must make their portfolios more competitive.”

Tarun Pathak from Counterpoint Research said that Huawei’s two-pronged strategy using its fast-growing Honor sub-brand to capture the mid-tier segment below £500 and its premium Huawei-branded smartphones at the top end, such as the P20 Pro, appeared to be working.

Analysts said that Huawei’s exclusion from the US has forced it to work harder across Asia and Europe to achieve its growth goals, with its mid-range models proving particularly popular. Data from Canalys showed that Huawei grew it market share in China by 6% to a record 27% in the quarter, where 100m smartphones were sold across the country.

Outside of China, Huawei’s increasing brand recognition newly allowing it to compete at the top end, but the Chinese market remains key for Huawei as it has come under fire from the US, Australia and other nations over concerns it could facilitate Chinese government spying.

Huawei has denied it facilitates spying and has said it is a private company not under Chinese government control and not subject to Chinese security laws overseas.

China and the US are also embroiled in a trade dispute with both nations imposing tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods and fighting over technology and patents, which analysts said creates significant uncertainty for all of the major smartphone brands.

Huawei said Tuesday that overall it had 15% higher revenue in the first six months of 2018, steady at levels seen a year ago. Revenue rose to 325.7bn yuan (£36.52bn), while operating margin rose to 14%, from 11% a year ago.

Huawei’s consumer division, which houses its smartphones business, accounted for roughly a third of its total revenue last year. It got half its revenue from its mobile phone network.",0.8717,
194,Football,Manchester United are missing a trick with José Mourinho: the reality show | Marina Hyde,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/aug/01/manchester-united-jose-mourinho-reality-show,2018-08-01T10:21:36Z,"In 2007, coinciding with the moment David Beckham made his debut for LA Galaxy, I was at their Home Depot Center ground in Los Angeles to watch José Mourinho’s Chelsea compete in something called the World Series of Soccer. Don’t look for this competition – they don’t play it any more. As part of their US summer tour, Chelsea beat LA Galaxy in the last match, though the competition was won on goal difference by – hang on, let me get my reading glasses on – Tigres UANL. Suwon Samsung Bluewings finished fourth.

Before the Galaxy game, Mourinho was asked by an American journalist how much the World Series of Soccer trophy would mean compared with others he had won, including the two Premier League titles and the Champions League with Porto. A pause. Looking the journalist directly in the eye, a smile playing round the corner of his lips, Mourinho declared it would mean just as much to him as all of those – “of course”. Obviously, I never speak for the 99% of gentlemen who make up the rest of the sports press pack but my reaction to the moment was the reflection: “I do slightly love you, you insolent bastard.”

It has been so unbelievably and immensely long since I slightly loved Mourinho that even mentioning this vignette feels like exhuming a Paleolithic artefact, turning it over in your hands and thinking: Ugh. This is dirty and I have no idea what it is or ever was.

Anyhow. I think the vague point is that no one could watch Mourinho on Manchester United’s summer tour in the US this year, and think anything other than what an endlessly sour bore he is. If Mourinho once felt like the ironist puppeteer at moments like this, he has long commuted down into the proverbial messy bitch who lives for the drama.

This (if slightly paraphrased) appears to be the verdict of some United players, who are reportedly briefing that they are finding the manager’s behaviour “exhausting” and that he is “dragging the whole tour down”. His demeanour is certainly weighing down many United fans, who are facing up to the fear it may well be their turn to endure one of Mourinho’s famous third seasons at a club.

Where will it end? I see the executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, has gone to meet Mourinho in Miami, perhaps to thrash out their transfer war in person, but the real puzzle is all the tricks Woodward has been missing. After all, the way Ed seems to see it, United are in the content business, of which “actual football” is only one of the parts. Consider his verdict on the signing of Alexis Sánchez in January: “The announcement posts generated 75% more interactions than the announcement of the sale of the world’s most expensive player last summer when Neymar moved from Barcelona to PSG.” There was even better news – Jesse Lingard’s recent “takeover” of United’s Instagram page had generated more than 40m impressions.

If your reaction to this is the Alan Partridge “so what?” gesture, catch up. Ed is on precisely the same page as United’s managing director, Richard Arnold, who has characterised the club as “the biggest TV show in the world”. A few years ago, the Irish Times’s Ken Early noted Arnold declaring triumphantly that United had “recently surpassed the social media following of Vin Diesel and were closing on Rihanna”.

“If you think about why people watch soap operas,” enthused Arnold, “it’s what will happen next. That uncertainly is part of what makes sport exciting.” All these things considered, Mourinho was the perfect hire – a classic soap diva who creates #content seemingly reflexively.

It seems baffling that these particular executives have failed to monetise Mourinho with some sort of fly‑on-the-wall reality series, particularly now the window may be rapidly closing. For all their postmodernist bluster, perhaps, United’s top brass are still some way behind the proper monsters of unscripted television. They have a lot to learn from, say, Mike Darnell – a US TV executive responsible for a welter of smash hits down the years, as well as controversial shows such as Who’s Your Daddy? in which an adult adoptee had to pick her biological father from a lineup.

Darnell’s sole regret about that show was that all the outrage generated “was outside the programme – so it doesn’t translate into ratings”. Remember: it doesn’t matter if people think your product is trashy or repulsive or morally bankrupt, as long as you are able to alchemise their anger into ratings gold. (This, you will have noted, is a formula which has now taken the biggest reality star of that era all the way to a highly sought after address in Pennsylvania Avenue.)

Something for Woodward and Arnold to bear in mind on their eternal quest to take things to “the next level” commercially. If rushed into production now, an unscripted reality Mourinho series would certainly have the ability to reach beyond the product’s existing customer base, or “Manchester United supporters” as they used to be known. Call it Keeping Up With The KarKrashing One – and give us at least three weeks of unmissable histrionics before its star walks out.",0.9764,

If you are anything like me, you can be easily overwhelmed by the range of deals on offer – Carphone Warehouse alone lists 77 different pay-monthly plans. But if your old mobile phone has died, or you just dropped it one too many times, don’t be seduced into signing a £30-a-month, two-year contract for a £500-plus smartphone because, as my recent experience shows, there is just no need to do so.

All you need to do is spend a little more than £100 on the latest Chinese-made Huawei (recently rebranded Honor) handset, and grab a £7.50-a-month sim-only deal from Tesco Mobile, and all but the most demanding of mobile users will not be able to spot the difference – and save hundreds of pounds.

How did we find out? Well, the Brignall household has just done exactly this, and couldn’t be happier.

Faced with a domestic mobile phone crisis – my daughter Lottie had dropped and smashed her old phone – I went on the hunt for a value smartphone that would do all the usual teen stuff, such as sending emails, using social media, surfing the web and, crucially for her, taking good photos.

Online reviews and the Guardian’s tech guru Samuel Gibbs pointed me to a couple of handsets – one of his favourite budget options, the then £169 Moto G6, was still a bit too pricey for us, but he also suggested Huawei/Honor. And the more I read online about its handsets, the more I was convinced this was probably the way to go.

At the time the £99 Huawei Y6 looked to be best sim-free deal – meaning my daughter could move her sim card over from the previous phone, and Carphone Warehouse could deliver the next day.

Within hours of its arrival she was declaring it great and, a few months on, it has proved a great choice. Battery life is very good and it does everything a 19-year-old design student has needed.

The camera has been excellent. Its only downside has been its lowly 16GB storage, but this was easily resolved with a £15 insertable SD card.

When two months later, my wife’s four-year-old Windows phone died, we again scouted the market.

On Amazon Prime Day, we bought the Honor 7C for £114, down from £169. Don’t tell my daughter, but this phone is even better, although some may find the 5.99-inch screen a bit too big.

So far she is similarly happy, and it has left us wondering why people are prepared to pay £700 to £999 for the latest handsets.

The advantage of buying a sim-free phone – over a contract deal – is that you are not locked in to an expensive provider and can put any sim card in it, at any time. Phones get better and cheaper all the time, so we decided that a three-year contract was no good for us.

Tesco Mobile’s sim deal is not the absolute cheapest, but it is very competitive, and the company offers the best customer service in the industry (winning accolades from Which? and scoring the best in regulator Ofcom’s complaints league table).

For £7.50 a month Tesco will give you 1GB of data and 500 minutes of calls – if you sign up for 12 months. It you want 6GB of data a month Tesco will charge you £12.50 a month. Tesco uses the 02 network. Giffgaff is also worth looking at, but you can’t go into a store and ask for help.

Carphone Warehouse’s sim-only deals (called ID Mobile) are also cheap – 1GB of data and 500 minutes of calls – for £5 a month, on a rolling deal, so you are not locked in.

The other advantage of sim-free is that if a better deal comes along you can switch without the bother of having to get the handset unlocked. Also, if you go on a trip outside the EU where roaming charges can still hit, you can simply put in a local sim.

This week the Techadvisor website, which spends hours comparing handsets, named the £469 OnePlus 6 the best phone you can buy right now, beating the £999 iPhone X and other rivals. “It is fairly priced, has the best specs you could hope for, looks great and has cameras that can compete with its rivals,” it said.

But to me, that still looks way too much. The Huawei P8 Lite is currently £129. If you don’t want to go with Huawei/Honor there are other bargains out there – but you won’t get as much for your money.",0.9987,
197,Life and style,Fluffed it! The truth about Build-A-Bear's day of mayhem,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/23/fluffed-it-the-truth-about-build-a-bears-day-of-mayhem,2018-07-23T05:00:25Z,"Thursday 12 July should have been a red-letter day for thousands upon thousands of kids, and for their favourite shop, Build-A-Bear Workshop. The company had announced a pay-your-age promotion, so customers in the UK, US and Canada could come in to make their own teddies and pay just a fraction of the normal cost: instead of £52 for a top-of-the-range bear, a six-year-old would pay just £6. It sounded brilliant.

What Build-A-Bear hadn’t factored in was the devotion of its young customers, and the unending human appetite for getting something cheap. Its shops were overwhelmed with huge queues wanting to take advantage. Police had to be called to help control the crowds outside the Leeds branch. Scores of shops had to close early; thousands of people left without getting in. Even some of those who did left wildly disappointed: one parent told the BBC that she and her children queued for three and a half hours to get into the Derby branch, then spent another two hours waiting to get their bears stuffed: “When I look back I will probably think, ‘What have I done that for?’ – especially with what I will end up paying for parking,” she said. The next day’s headlines contained the words no executive wants to see describing their business: “chaos”, “carnage”, “fiasco”.

You might have thought Build-A-Bear would take urgent action to ensure a different outcome when its US stores opened, hours later, but no. Ben Bigalke and his three-and-a-half-year-old daughter Astrid arrived at their local Build-A-Bear Workshop in Minnesota’s Mall of America at 9.30am – 3.30pm UK time, several hours into the day of disaster. “The area around the store was completely packed with ensconced, almost camped-out customers,” he tells me by email. “The line zigzagged through the mall’s first floor and wound its way entirely through the theme park in the centre of the mall to the other side of the mall. It seemed like a quarter-mile-long line, at least. We learned later that people began camping out at 6am and there were probably more than 500 people – maybe 1,000 – in line before the store even opened. We were nowhere near the store.”

In Minnesota, despite what had already happened in the UK, the events came as a complete surprise to all concerned. The Build-A-Bear store staff didn’t tell customers about how long they might be waiting, or what was happening. “I asked a security guard what to expect and they said they were upset by the situation, saying it was unexpected and that they were not prepared or even forewarned that something like that could happen,” Bigalke says. “They didn’t have any information about how many hours we could be expected to stay in line for, and I feel like they should have known. There also should have been representatives from the store telling us what was happening and what to expect.”

Pay-your-age was the first major disaster in Build-A-Bear’s 21-year history, during which time the company has usually been ahead of the game, both as a retailer and a mythmaker. It is rare that a shopping chain has an origin story – its US founder, Maxine Clark, had been shopping with a friend’s children when the little girl commented that they should make their own bears in the absence of anything new in the shops. A lightbulb went on in Clark’s head. Of course, it wasn’t quite as homespun as that: Clark was an experienced retail executive, who had worked for the May Co department store company and been president of Payless ShoeSource. She knew what she was doing.

The first part of Clark’s genius – and it was genius – was to anticipate what was to prove the most important shopping development of the internet age before it was de rigueur: experiential retailing. In summer 1998 – a year after Clark set up her first Build-A-Bear Workshop in St Louis, Missouri – Harvard Business Review published Welcome to the Experience Economy, an influential essay that set out the path ahead. “From now on, leading-edge companies – whether they sell to consumers or businesses – will find that the next competitive battleground lies in staging experiences,” wrote its authors. “An experience is not an amorphous construct; it is as real an offering as any service, good, or commodity … Businesses must deliberately design engaging experiences that command a fee. This transition from selling services to selling experiences will be no easier for established companies to undertake and weather than the last great economic shift, from the industrial to the service economy.”

This was precisely Clark’s business plan. Build-A-Bear has an eight-step process: “Choose Me, Hear Me, Stuff Me, Stitch Me, Fluff Me, Dress Me, Name Me, and Take Me Home.” Everyone who buys from one of Build-A-Bear’s 361 stores or 102 franchised shops – in the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Denmark and China – has the same experience. They choose an outer skin from more than 30 options; they select a sound chip to go inside (it can be a prerecorded sound, or one they record themselves); they add in a small satin heart (the part of the process that is the most emotionally rewarding, or manipulative, depending on your point of view); they get it stuffed to “just the right amount of huggability”; they get the bear sewn up, with a unique barcode for future online participation; they get the fur fluffed; they accessorise it with clothes and extras. They give it a name to be put on a birth certificate and “passport” (I know of one parent who always takes his children’s bear passport on business trips, in order to buy something from the local Build-A-Bear Workshop and get the passport stamped). Then they are given the bear in a special carrying case to take home.

“I think they did something incredibly clever,” says Corin Birchall, founder of the retail consultancy Kerching. “You pick away at the corners and there’s not actually a lot to it. But it absolutely captured kids’ imaginations and turned this commodity into a tangibly valuable product. At all retailers across the world, as the internet makes the market more global, a retailer’s job is to add tangible value to their place in the sale journey. I can’t think of another retailer that has added more value to the process. It’s just incredible how well they can monetise something that seems intangible to an adult. They were ahead of the curve in doing that.”

And, for kids, the intangible really is something magical. Nicola Hunt’s nine-year-old daughter, Jenna, has nine bears and the associated accessories – the bears are from parties and gifts, the accessories (where Build-A-Bear makes a huge chunk of its revenue) bought with birthday money. The number of accessories seems unending, all priced at what appears a reasonable level individually, but capable of mounting up: £4.50 for a pair of bear sunglasses, £14 for a tent, £8 for a sleeping bag, £2 for a headband, and on and on and on.

While Hunt feels disquiet at the hard sell given to parents, she admires the way the staff interact with children who visit the stores. “I like the actual process of choosing a bear, I like the way they put the heart in and you give it a kiss. But the bears are overpriced, the quality isn’t good and you can’t wash them.” Nevertheless, she has seen how important her bears have been to Jenna. “She was very unwell last year and in and out of hospital,” she says. “One of the things we did was go to Build-A-Bear and get a bear to go through the process with her. That was really helpful. When she had a drip in her arm, the Build-A-Bear had a drip in its arm. There was something very special about it.”

The second part of Clark’s genius was choosing the teddy bear, a toy that has remained fundamentally unchanged since coming to the market 115 years ago. “The teddy bear has become an icon, a symbol of childhood, which is why campaigns aimed at children use the image of a bear – think of Pudsey,” says Deborah Jaffé, author of The History of Toys. “The teddy was the first really mass-produced soft toy. But it was just chance it was bear – it could have been a dog or a monkey. But a bear is a simple shape to make and doesn’t use much material. It’s not as complicated as, say, making an elephant.”

They remain popular, Jaffé says, not just because of their simplicity and sweetness – and, truthfully, who does not love a nice teddy bear? – but because animals can stand in for humans in a universal way: bears have neither race nor gender. “You get this in children’s book illustrations: in order to get round gender stereotyping or race and ethnicity, it’s easy to use the animal rather than a human form. When you put a human form in, it gets much more complicated. Mattel have had to make Barbie in lots of ethnicities – but you don’t have to do that with an animal.”

Clark had hit on the perfect combination: a universal product and a new way to sell it, and then to continue to sell. By registering each bear with a unique code before it leaves the store, Build-A-Bear gives its young customers the chance to continue participating – and spending – in the Build-A-Bear experience online once they get home: as well as buying yet more stuff, they can participate in Build-A-Bear’s world. “Our website lets children create virtual versions of themselves and their animals and interact with each other online,” Clark explained in 2013.

Even before data was such a valuable commodity, Clark had created an idea that meant Build-A-Bear knew more about its customers’ tastes than most toy retailers. As its senior marketing manager for digital explained in 2015: “We’re looking at the data from a macro level to understand whether a particular product resonates with a girl who’s four years old or 12 years old, and as you market to the mother, how do you continue to tell the mother about additional pets or accessories and fashions? We’re starting to get into this from a digital perspective with our loyalty members where we have that type of data collection because they chose the option of us continuing to market to them on a one-to-one basis.”

By the time Clark stepped down as CEO in 2013, the company had generated $5bn (£3.8bn) in sales. It also continued to expand its “experiential offering”. As Clark’s reign drew to a close, it was introducing “HyperSound directional audio technology” into some of its stores, which would let Build-A-Bear run multiple interactive kiosks within its shops, offering a specific audio message to customers. Directional audio is yet another of the techniques used by retailers to try to prolong time in-store and increase the amount they spend. Or, as the website Retail Customer Experience put it: “By using directional audio retailers can create an immersive 3D sound environment confined to a specific area … Those outside of the zone don’t hear the sound, and for the shopper the experience is similar to wearing headphones, except they aren’t wearing headphones … The memorable experience delivered via directional audio adds a ‘wow’ factor that increases the effectiveness of advertising messages, ultimately leading to increased sales.”Fearing kids were being lost to screens, it partnered with Samsung to place interactive stations in shops, so customers could build their bears without any of the burdensome physical or personal interaction of the traditional experience.

But times aren’t necessarily easy for Build-A-Bear. It made a loss in 2013, when Clark left, before bouncing back into profit. Its 2017 annual report notes that total revenues have declined year-on-year since 2014; last year’s profits are little more than half its 2014 levels. The report admits one of the main contributors to a consolidated net income increase over the previous year was “an increase in gift card breakage revenue”. In short, a big chunk of its profit was down to gift cards that had been sold not being redeemed.

The pay-your-age promotion was meant to be the start of a new thrust. By making it open only to members of the Build-A-Bear Bonus Club, it hoped to entice scores of new customers to register. Doubtless they succeeded. Unfortunately, the offer they made was just too good. In the wake of the fiasco, a YouGov poll found that while awareness of the brand had rocketed, that awareness was almost entirely negative.

And, as Birchall observes, the episode was entirely avoidable. First, he says, it is “quite alarming” how badly Build-A-Bear underestimated the level of demand. What’s more, the fact that the whole appeal of the shop is based on a time-consuming experience means it does not lend itself to events with acute peaks of traffic, rather than steady flows. “I can’t fathom how they could be that far out.”

At this point, it would be apt to give the last word to Build-A-Bear. I sent them 15 questions, most of which were purely factual, and some specifically about the pay-your-age promotion. After due consideration, the company’s PR people sent back their response. “We greatly appreciate your interest in this story. We are still reviewing and analysing, so we’re not able to answer most of your questions at this time. That said, we did want to share the press release regarding the Build-A-Bear Count Your Candles program to ensure you had the full details on this program that launched last week.”

So I go to Brent Cross shopping centre in north London, to the branch hidden away inside the Fenwick department store. There were no customers there on a warm Wednesday morning during term time. Can I speak to the manager, please? Yes, that’s me. Would you be willing to tell me what it was like to be in charge on the Thursday of pay-your-age? She looks panicked and says she has to call her boss. A couple of minutes later, she returns. “We’re not allowed to talk to anyone. No interviews.”

At Build-A-Bear, the PR shutters are down. But the bears still sit there in their rows, waiting to be stuffed, fluffed, named and taken home.

198,Technology,Cracking news: improved smartphone glass twice as likely to survive drops,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/19/cracking-news-smartphone-gorilla-glass-twice-survive-drops-smash-iphone-samsung,2018-07-19T10:50:56Z,"Glass-maker Corning has unveiled a new version of its Gorilla Glass used in the majority of smartphone displays, which it says is twice as likely to survive being dropped.



As phones get bigger, and come with glass on the back as well as the front, the potential for smashed devices has increased. While cases have helped, even heavily protected phone screens still end up shattered from impact and then stress from being bent, squeezed or bumped in a pocket or bag.

Gorilla Glass 6 is a new chemically strengthened and highly compressed glass that Corning says has twice the drop protection of its Gorilla Glass 5.

“With breaks during drops being a probabilistic event, the added compression helps increase, on average, the likelihood of survival through multiple drop events,” said Dr Jaymin Amin, vice president of technology and product development at Corning.

The new glass survived an average of 15 drops from 1m on to rough surfaces in lab tests compared to 11 for the previous version, meaning it should be more resistant to multiple drops.

“Gorilla Glass 6 improves upon Gorilla Glass 5 by surviving drops from higher heights, but, more importantly, has been engineered to survive multiple drops,” said John Bayne, vice president and general manager for Corning Gorilla Glass.

Corning said Gorilla Glass 6 has similar scratch resistance and other properties to the older glass.

Apple’s current iPhones, Samsung’s Galaxy 9 and the majority of premium smartphones sold in the UK, all use the older Gorilla Glass 5. Corning said Gorilla Glass 6 will be on the market in the next several months, which means top-end smartphones launched in the second half of this year should ship with it.

With multiple iPhones expected in September, along with new Google Pixel smartphones in October and the replacement for the Galaxy S9 in the first quarter of 2019, your next smartphone might not break when you drop it, over and over.",0.8171,
199,UK news,Man who called for attack on Prince George jailed for terrorism,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/13/man-who-called-for-attack-on-prince-george-jailed-for-terrorism,2018-07-13T14:18:13Z,"An Islamic State supporter who called for an attack on Prince George has been jailed for life with a minimum of 25 years for a string of terrorism offences.

Husnain Rashid, of Nelson, Lancashire, called for the four-year-old to be targeted shortly after the prince joined Thomas’s school in Battersea, south-west London, last year.

On 13 October, he posted a photograph of the school superimposed with silhouettes of two masked jihadist fighters. He sent a follow-up message that listed the address, writing: “Even the royal family will not be left alone. School starts early.”

The posts about Prince George were a tiny fraction of Rashid’s output in the 13 months before his arrest on 22 November last year. He also suggested injecting cyanide into fruit and vegetables at grocery stores and poisoning ice-cream in supermarkets, and attacking fans at the football World Cup in Russia.

The 32-year-old initially denied all charges against him, but mid-trial changed his plea on four of the seven counts, admitting three counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts and one count of encouraging terrorism. The Crown Prosecution Service said he had done so only when faced with “the overwhelming weight of evidence against him”.



DCI Andy Meeks, the case’s senior investigating officer, from the north-west counter-terrorism unit, said Rashid had posted 360,000 messages in 150 different forums on Telegram, an online messaging service, between November 2016 and his arrest a year later.



Judge Andrew Lees said the messages, which included exhortations to attack UK football stadiums, the 2017 general election, Wimbledon, the Trafford Centre in Manchester and the BBC’s Proms in the Park, may have been viewed by millions of people.



Sentencing Rashid at Woolwich crown court on Friday, Lees said: “The message was clear: you were providing the name and address of Prince George’s school, an image of Prince George’s school and the instruction or threat that Prince George and other members of the royal family should be viewed as potential targets.”

Rashid was given a life sentence for each count of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts, with a minimum term of 25 years. He was sentenced to four and half years’ imprisonment for the offence of encouraging terrorism, to run concurrently.

Rashid, who worked as a teacher at the Muhammadi mosque in Nelson, encouraged followers to deploy a variety of weapons, including knives, homemade bombs, poison, chemicals, vehicles and krav maga, a martial art employed by Israeli military forces.

He praised successful terrorist attacks in other countries, writing: “Look around you, how many infidels can you reach to and kill, with your car, knife, or even a stone, or poisoning them! … Go out and take revenge! What are you waiting for? … We ask Allah to bless you and make you successful.”

One Christmas he posted a message online wishing people a “terror-filled new year”.

The prosecutor, Annabel Darlow QC, said the overarching aim of Rashid’s activities was to provide an “e-toolkit for terrorism”. He suggested dropping a smoke grenade “to cause panic”, adding: “You will be enjoying taking them down one after the other #terrorizethekuffar.”



He also posted: “No need to board trains. Just get to the train station. Then, in the name of Allah, get busy!” These words were followed by emojis of a bomb and a knife dripping blood. There was no evidence that anyone acted on his posts.

Rashid went to great lengths to hide his online extremism from the authorities. The encryption on his laptop’s two-terabyte hard drive was so strong that intelligence agencies have been unable to crack it. He used the encrypted Telegram app on three different sim cards and hacked into his neighbours’ internet connections to publish material online.



The vast majority of his activity was carried out on a Samsung smartphone that had no sim card, was on airplane mode and had tape over the camera lens, which police say was counter-surveillance tradecraft.



When officers came to arrest him, Rashid threw the phone out the back door but it landed at the feet of a police officer. He pretended to faint when told he was under arrest.



Rashid lived with his elderly parents in a terraced house in Nelson, a former cotton town. A few doors down, in another house owned by his parents, he urged his online followers to launch real-world attacks.



He came to the attention of counter-terrorism officers in November 2016, about seven months after he is believed to have started posting online, but he was not previously known to the police and had no prior convictions. 



He was in contact electronically with Omar Ali Hussain, a former Morrisons security guard who joined Islamic State in Syria. Rashid asked Hussain for advice on how to join him in Syria, and was advised by Hussain on methods of attack, including bringing down aircraft with lasers.

Four days before his arrest, Rashid made contact with Amaq, the Isis propaganda agency, saying he was “desperate” to join the group in Syria. He saved £6,000 through an office job at a garage and applied for a passport in 2016, which police say he planned to use to travel to the war-torn region.



At the time of his arrest, Rashid was working on creating a glossy magazine called Lone Mujahid, the same name as one of his Telegram channels. It was intended to be similar to the al-Qaida publication Inspire, which he distributed along with an Isis-produced magazine.

200,Technology,"Samsung phones sent photos to random contacts, users say",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/03/samsung-galaxy-s8-s9-phones-sent-photos-random-contacts,2018-07-03T11:02:53Z,"Samsung is investigating reports that its default text messaging app on the Galaxy S8 and S9 smartphones is sending photos to random contacts without permission.



Users posted complaints on Reddit and Samsung’s support forums about a strange issue that appears to be silently sending photos to random contacts. The Samsung Messages app doesn’t show any sign of sending the photos, meaning the user is completely unaware of the picture messaging.

“Last night around 2.30am, my phone sent her my entire photo gallery over text but there was no record of it on my messages app. However, there was record of it on Tmobile logs. Why would this happen?” asked one Reddit user.

“Oddly enough, my wife’s phone did that last night, and mine did it the night before,” said Reddit user Sfkn123. “I think it has something to do with the Samsung SMS app being updated from the Galaxy Store. When her phone texted me her gallery, it didn’t show up on her end -- and vice versa.”

Reddit user Moosan said something similar had happened to them. “My phone’s battery was super low overnight so maximum power saving had kicked in from a routine I set with Good Lock, and two or three people had been sent photos (just one each, and they were photos I had sent them in the past).”

While it’s not clear what is causing the random picture messaging, affected users reported receiving an update to the default text messaging app on their Samsung smartphones that enables Rich Communication Services (RCS). This is the long-awaited replacement for SMS that adds modernisation features such as picture messaging, typing indicators and read receipts.

Samsung said: “We are aware of the reports regarding this matter and our technical teams are looking into it.”

Affected users are encouraged to contact Samsung directly until a fix is issued.

In the meantime, users can switch to another text messaging app, such as Google’s Android Messages, or disable access to phone storage for the Samsung Messages app.",0.8208,

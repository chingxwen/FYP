Fashion,'Don't shoot': why Vetements' latest T-shirt is causing controversy,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jun/24/dont-shoot-why-vetements-latest-t-shirt-is-causing-controversy,2019-06-24T18:37:15Z,"Trend-setting label Vetements has been criticised for featuring a T-shirt that read “Don’t shoot” in Arabic, French and English, at its spring/summer 2020 show last week. The T-shirt is a semi-replica of one originally worn by journalists in Lebanon during the Israeli invasion of the country in 1982.

Vogue Arabia has accused Vetements of “instigating regional upset”. While on social media, some have criticised the brand for using a T-shirt with links to a war in which thousands were killed. As one Twitter user put it: “This war is the primary reason why I had to leave Lebanon to the US then Canada. And Vetements thinks it’s a fashion piece?” Another put it simply: “Ugh vetements.” The brand did not immediately respond when asked to comment.

For others, the criticism has focused on the fact that the French fashion brand has followed in the footsteps of fashion label Qasimi, which, in 2018, also created a replica of the T-shirt. The Emirati designer behind the London-based design said at the time: “This T-shirt was something very personal to me … We’ve reworked it to highlight issues of the Middle East and what’s happening in the Middle East at the moment.”

The Vetements T-shirt was part of a collection that toyed with ideas of consumerism and late-stage capitalism, sometimes uncomfortably close to the line. The show itself, from a brand that relocated to Zurich in 2017, took place in Paris’s biggest branch of McDonald’s, which had not long ago been targeted by French anti-government gilets jaunes protestors. Models wore name stickers saying: “Hello I am capitalism”; tops riffed on the World Economic Forum logo, reworked to read: “Global Mind Fuck” and hoodies featured PlayStation logos reworked to read “Paystation”.

Vetements designer Demna Gvasalia is no stranger to the bootlegged look, having produced a now infamous T-shirt in 2016 with the DHL logo on it. While, in his role as head designer of Balenciaga, he has played with the design of the Ikea Frakta bag and referenced the carrier bag design of German supermarket chain Edeka. But international courier companies and Swedish furniture stores are a different beast to a T-shirt that for many will have associations with war.

Fashion activist Samar Seraqui de Buttafoco took to Instagram to call out what she sees as the “business activism” of Vetements. “This is not about cultural appropriation,” she explained over the phone. “For me, it is culture bashing.” According to the Palestinian-Lebanese style blogger and former political journalist who is based in Paris, Vetements designer Demna Gvasalia “has the right to be interested by what happened in the Middle East and put it in the light”. The problem, she says, “is that he’s denigrated our culture because he’s taken the ‘Don’t Shoot’ T-shirt from another less famous designer … it isn’t the problem of doing business with our history, but you have to be respectful.”

Speaking to Vogue Arabia, Al-Qasimi, who does not own copyright for the phrase, said: “I understand what they are doing. It’s about consumerism. But it’s a complete F-U to the region … I used that print to highlight the plight of something going on in the Middle East. For Vetements to use it in such a flippant and provocative manner; I don’t think they realise what these words mean to us Arabs.”

Some have pointed out that the Qasimi T-shirts, which are sold for £115, also in their way capitalise on the phrase. But others have defended the designer, saying his intentions were very different. In an interview with Wonderland a few years ago, he said: “I feel it’s important to discuss political issues, especially when coming from the Middle East. I use fashion as a medium to have a discourse and exchange points of view. I always reference the Middle East alongside other inspirations, be it politics, architecture or contemporary art.”

For all of her criticism of the Vetements T-shirt, Seraqui de Buttafoco thinks it is good that people, “will know the story of what happened in Beirut and perhaps it will give them the idea to go and buy books and understand.”"
Fashion,Clickbait fashion! You won’t believe what brands are doing now,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/may/15/clickbait-fashion-you-wont-believe-what-brands-are-doing-now,2019-05-15T07:00:04Z,"Earlier this month, the US fashion brand Fashion Nova posted a picture on its Instagram account of a model wearing a pair of pink jeans with extreme rips. The image has had almost 20,000 likes and lots of comments – and not all of them the fire emoji. One follower wrote: “Do you have these in a ‘no thank you’”, while another compared the rips to “another DREADFUL bear attack”.

This isn’t just Instagram banter. Not long after the brand posted the image, the Sun picked up on the jeans, bringing them to the attention of a demographic that gets its news from more traditional sources than Instagram. Forget trends such as gingham or pastel gently trickling down from the catwalk on to the high street, the fashion pieces now most likely to make the news are the work of brands attempting to outdo one another with more and more attention-grabbing garments. Welcome to the world of clickbait fashion.

And it’s a strategy that is working. You may not have heard of Fashion Nova – and are even less likely to have bought anything from it – but it is the fifth biggest brand in the US among teenagers (for context, Amazon is number one). Brands such as Asos and Topshop, as well as high-end labels such as Balenciaga and Y-Project, have all been the subject of much-shared news stories where a single item is ridiculed for being – delete as appropriate – unwearable/ugly/ludicrous/laughable. See Topshop’s PVC see-through jeans, a croptop for men from Asos that skims the top of its wearer’s nipples, Balenciaga’s bootcut jeans for men, Y-Project’s now infamous denim high-cut knickers (the Janties); and, in the past week, Fashion Nova’s “see-through coverup chaps”, on sale for £19.

The world of clickbait fashion even has that modern measure of success: its own satirical Instagram. Asbos_sos highlights all of Asos’s supposed sartorial fails. In one recent post, a red PVC zipped T-shirt is compared to an outfit Britney Spears wore in 2000’s Oops! … I Did It Again video. In many ways, this is the next phase of the fashion meme – and another example of the internet having a good laugh at fashion’s expense. Over the past five years, everything from Rihanna’s Met Ball “omelette dress” to Balenciaga’s Joey Tribbiani-style layered jackets have been turned into social-media fodder.

If that sounds like a negative for brands, don’t be fooled. This is a case of all publicity being good publicity. Janties endured a comprehensive take down on Twitter at the start of April. But, by the end of the month, there was a 2,250% increase in searches of the design according to the global fashion search platform Lyst, which tipped them as the jumping off point for festival trends this year, and they had sold out on the retail platform Ssense. “Hype is real,” says Lyst’s vice-president of communications, Katy Lubin. “If a product goes viral for any reason, whether that’s because people think it’s incredible or people think: ‘Oh my God, I’d never wear that thing,’ what we see is that it causes this dramatic, often 1,000%-plus spike in searches for that particular product.”

Anastasia Denisova is a lecturer in journalism at the University of Westminster and has written about viral culture. She thinks part of the reason social media users like these kinds of posts is down to “the debate” and how it can increase your online status. “You can make fun of ridiculous fashion choices or outfits and get several benefits at once,” she says. “The reputation of a witty person who makes others laugh; a feeling of being part of a community as others join in the mockery and the chance to defend your own identity and fashion choices, which may not be that exciting but may, nonetheless, be more sensible – especially in contrast to see-through plastic jeans.”

As much as these products promote ridicule, they are being bought by a growing band of more experimental consumers. The see-through jeans are a case in point – they sold out. Topshop’s global design director, Anthony Cuthbertson, says they were a “limited-edition run for our early adopters who like to experiment – we like to give them things they can have fun with”. Cuthbertson is also on board with the reaction that comes with such items. “[The transparent jeans] got discussed extensively in the press and on social media and we loved the debate they sparked,” he says.

The tension between the extreme end of fashion and the rest of society is far from new. Designers have always enjoyed creating things that shake up the status quo and scare the squares. Claude Montana’s collections in the 80s had the look of an S&M club, while Alexander McQueen’s bumsters brought the young designer into the public eye, due to the low cut design that revealed the top of the wearer’s bottom. Mainstream culture loves nothing more than mocking the madcap world of high fashion. In an interview with a young Vivienne Westwood on Wogan in 1988, Sue Lawley asked “if people were supposed to laugh” when looking at her clothes.

The difference here may be that fast fashion brands – traditionally less madcap than the catwalk – are now involved. Topshop et al are arguably following the example of the biggest disrupter in the current fashion landscape, Demna Gvasalia, the founder of Vetements and creative director of Balenciaga, famous for the £185 T-shirt Vetements made with the DHL logo, the £1,600 version of the Ikea Frakta bag and the original Dad sneakers, the Balenciaga Triple S. The brand’s bootcut jeans for men – reminiscent of the kind worn around 2002 typically with smart shoes – had the clickbait treatment in December after an article on GQ.com proclaimed “bootcut jeans are making a comeback”. Typical responses on Twitter ranged from “our society is crumbling” to “thank u, next”.

Tyler Watamanuk is the journalist who wrote the article and says it is the most shared piece he has written for the site. He sees this development as symptomatic of bigger trends. “I think this current era of fashion is heavy on maximalism and big ideas,” he says. “Designers are taking bigger and bigger swings at new designs so there are bound to be some misses. And those misses just happen to be excellent fodder for memes.”

Whether or not brands are creating pieces specifically for memes is unclear, but it would make sense. “I would imagine there’s a certain amount of being provocative and meme-baiting going on,” says Lyst’s Lubin. “As with any customer behaviour, smart marketers will be looking for ways to engage and resonate with those customers.”

Watamanuk argues that Gvasalia is a pro at this: “He’s built his career on this type of nonsensical grabby design,” he says. It’s a model that works: for 2018, Balenciaga has been the fastest growing brand in the luxury conglomerate Kering.

A sense of community is something that social media will always have in its favour – it is where we can unite in outrage over a politician’s controversial remarks, a Game of Thrones plot fail and, yes, what might be deemed questionable fashion. “There is this playground community feeling in these episodes,” says Denisova. “Mockery and satire have always been around, for centuries, it is an outlet that permits us to laugh at ourselves, see life a bit less seriously.” For Watamanuk, “as a writer, it’s a little disheartening to see a short news article of yours get this much attention … but you can’t control the internet.”

Plus, he says, “any chance to spark a day where we all roast bootcut jeans is OK with me”."
Fashion,What does it meme? The rise and rise of the fashion viral,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/16/what-does-it-meme-the-rise-and-rise-of-the-fashion-viral,2019-02-16T10:00:09Z,"I have never worn anything that could be considered “online content”. And, to the best of my knowledge, I have never gone viral. That is until one spring morning, enjoying a snack by the canal, alone save for the ducks, I realised someone on the bridge was taking a photograph of me. I glanced down at the dress I had on – less a dress, actually, and more a length of elegant bedding – and realised I had never looked more shareable.

The elegant bedding in question was a vast, diaphanous day gown by London-based designer Emilia Wickstead, from her spring/summer 2019 collection. It comes with a coif cap in the same 18th century-style print and there is a train, of sorts, which billows underfoot, and holes within the folds for my hands.

It is gorgeous to wear, like weighted swaddling – until the breeze inflates the whole thing like a balloon. Still, with the right Photoshop tinkering, a pithy caption and an Instagram account, it could easily morph into a visual gag – a giant eiderdown, a pair of curtains or, with the headpiece, a chintzy version of a Handmaid’s dress. In short, this is a dress that could become a meme.

If you use social media, you will have seen a meme on Instagram or laughed at one on Facebook, even if you don’t really know what it is. This is forgivable – it has become amorphous as a term – but the original concept dates back to 1976, when the word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene. He took it from the Greek root “mimeme” (“that which is imitated”), shaved it into a neat monosyllabic word to make it snappier (you know, like a meme) and used it to describe a unit of cultural transmission that shows the spread of ideas or culture.

Nowadays anything can become a meme, be it an idea, song or theory; a lolcat, distracted boyfriend or dancing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The successful ones are hard to predict – it’s usually about flinging something against the wall and seeing what sticks. But occasionally one sticks so well, it goes viral. And often these come from fashion. Consider the following: Angelina Jolie in Versace at the 2012 Oscars, flashing her right leg, a stance that bore memorable memes such as “Jolie’ing” and leg-bombing. Or Rihanna’s yolk-yellow 2015 Met Gala outfit, dubbed “the omelette dress” for its resemblance to breakfast. Quickly memeified, the viral attention put designer Guo Pei on the map.

The fashion-meme industry relies on two things: designers to make meme-friendly pieces and social media whizzes to turn them into memes. If fashion finds beauty and profit in designing familiar objects in an unfamiliar way, then placing high-fashion in a non-fashion context is the next logical step. Accounts such as @freddiemade and @siduations are probably the best examples of fashion meme makers, with both using a sort of cut-and-paste recontextualisation method. Say model Bella Hadid in Versace trainers “running” a marathon, a plastic-caped Balenciaga model superimposed into that apartment scene in American Psycho, or Viktor & Rolf couture Photoshopped with the head of Fyre festival’s Andy King from the Netflix documentary. It’s these gags that make their work chime with a demographic who live their lives – and tell their jokes – online.

It might seem cynical, but right now, if you were to pit the dress on the catwalk against the dress in some sort of witty meme-y context, you’d get more likes for the latter. Humour is integral – partly because, to use the correct parlance, it provides that crucial “if you know, you know” lol. Instagram artist Hey Reilly, who’s had his illustrations on the catwalk through a collaboration with Fendi, explains: “I look for a hit in the image that reflects a sense of almost subconscious recognition in the viewer. An effective route to this jolt is by playing around with recognised fashion and celebrity imagery: it gets me lolling and hopefully others, too.”

With the fashion landscape so crowded, the ability of these memes to cut through our daily barrage of images hasn’t gone unnoticed by brands. Now, the most successful designers aren’t avoiding the viral end of pop culture. Instead, they’re actively trying to create something meme-friendly, an “it” item that piques our interest and sets the internet on fire.

Under Demna Gvasalia, Balenciaga is a leader of memeable fashion – see last year’s layered anoraks recalling a memorable Joey Tribbiani scene from Friends – as many memes on social media happily pointed out. In 2017, Marc Jacobs even collaborated with Instagram bootlegger @avanope on a T-shirt collection that looked like bad market stall copies of Jacobs’ work, and showcased her in-joke irony to a new – and in the know – audience. Gucci is in on it as well: the models carrying casts of their own heads, as they did for SS18, were arguably more memorable – and certainly more memeable – than the clothes themselves.

Even more sober houses such as Valentino have been pulled into the viral ecosystem. Any designer who showed a long red gown recently could have found their work superimposed on to a scene from the TV version of The Handmaid’s Tale, and became a totem for women’s rights. For pre-fall, Valentino’s collection had 33 head-to-toe red looks, begging for Elisabeth Moss’s bonneted head to be Photoshopped in. Whether or not it was designed with woke memes in mind is unclear, but it certainly lends itself to the genre.

This season, meme-friendly fashion continued. See the supersized bag that dwarfed models at Jacquemus, a ginormous wide-brimmed hat at Valentino, giant bows at Marc Jacobs and half of Jeremy Scott’s collection for Moschino – which reworked a sewing basket’s contents into designer dresses.

Intentional or not, creating clothes that become memes is a sure-fire way to set yourself apart from the old guard. With around 60% of luxury customers of a millennial age, clicks not only lead to sales: as a marketing strategy, they are arguably more important for getting your brand out there. “Designer brands are gradually realising they must lose their haughty image if they want to sell their clothes to a generation consumed by the internet,” says Holly Friend, foresight writer at The Future Laboratory.

If comparing a coat or dress with a cat meme seems reductive, it certainly gives the label an edge. For Moschino designer Jeremy Scott, this is no bad thing. “For something to be meme-worthy, sure, it could be a negative,” he says. “But what I do is playful. If you can’t find something funny around it, well, oh dear you.”

For Simon Porte Jacquemus, of hip French label Jacquemus, it goes with the territory. “I often start [designing] with a specific photograph,” he says. “And when I think of the silhouettes, I think of styling from the beginning. I also see how clothes would look through a screen. I come from a digital generation.”

With his giant hats and postcard-backdrop shows, Jacquemus is arguably the crown prince of meme-friendly fashion. His infamous 2018 La Bomba hat is already a classic and he obviously approved of its online reception – if its sequel, SS19’s equally mega-bag, is anything to go by. The element of absurdity, the fact that they photograph well and their being – like Wickstead’s dress – larger than life helped make them deliciously memeable.

Still, memes paraded on the catwalk, or your Instagram feed, are one thing. But let’s not forget these are clothes and meant to be worn. If you put on that hat in public, you’d probably block out the sun. As for the Jacquemus bag, imagine wedging it into an easyJet locker. This stuff looks funny, but isn’t easy to wear.

I should know, having spent the best part of the morning in a floor-length Moschino gown covered in three-inch gold needles. Sure it’s elegant, and riffs on a Franco Moschino original, but, like the most memorable pieces from Scott’s show, it is more than a dress: it’s a cartoon, a commentary, riffing on the idea of fast fashion. It even comes with a thimble to wear on your head. And given it weighs 20kg and takes two people to lift it off the hanger, it’s unwearable. The hat falls off as soon as you move. You carry the entire weight of the dress on your shoulders. But it is designed to be seen, and photographed, and shared on social media rather than to walk down the street. By wearing it, I’m showing I’m in on the joke.

The next day, my shoulders still sore, I take it down a notch by moving from the Moschino dress into a monochrome Erdem look, which by contrast is normality itself. The cape hangs beautifully, allowing air to circulate. The trousers are stiff but wearable. The beekeeper’s veil – yep – would be essential wearing if I worked in a hive. Standing on a street that is bee-free, I wonder what would compel me to wear a delicate veil like this in public and realise nothing, save a funeral. Until I see myself transplanted on to a meme, at which point it all makes sense.

Scott was making a salient point about the fashion industry when he designed his collection but he’s also well aware of the shareability of his designs. I put this point to Dawkins. He claims he had fashion in the back of his mind when he came up with the term meme. “Changing styles and the epidemic spread of trends – people noticing what someone is wearing and copying it and that being repeated over and over – this is the ideal medium for illustrating how a meme works.”

Labels that meme well arguably do well, too. Kering, the conglomerate that owns Gucci and Balenciaga, gets over half its revenue from meme-happy millennials, suggesting there is financial method in them. In 2016, Instagram – where memes thrive – claimed a third of its then 500m users, 90% of whom are under 35, had bought clothing through the social network.

But it’s also about lifting clothes out of their safe space, into the gaze of a wider audience. Part of the reason Demna Gvasalia’s Balenciaga gets so much attention is because it turns fashion into a cultural moment, as with the recontextualising of a Bernie Sanders logo on to a scarf (AW17) or a computer font into a print (SS19). This is outward-facing fashion. Gvasalia actively wants to be part of the cultural conversation, and knows some of that is communicated through the language of memes.

I suspect Wickstead – a designer more at home in the rarefied environs of Kensington Palace than a meme – would probably be horrified that I compared her dress to a duvet. But Gvasalia is regularly accused of trolling his own customers with designs such as the infamous T-shirt with a DHL logo, sold for £185, and his customers are A-OK with that. This sort of ironic publicity is the bread and butter of the industry now and we want to participate in it. “By creating, sharing or buying these products, we can demonstrate our alliance to internet culture,” Friend says. “After all, we want to be in on the joke.” Even if that means we become the joke."

Business,Staffline begins inquiry over concerns about invoicing and payroll,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/30/staffline-begins-inquiry-over-concerns-about-invoicing-and-payroll,2019-01-30T20:39:56Z,"Recruitment and training firm Staffline has launched an internal investigation after concerns were raised over “invoicing and payroll practices” within its recruitment division.

The firm, which supplies staff to major UK companies including Tesco and Marks & Spencer, said in a stock market announcement that the issues were brought to the board’s attention on Wednesday morning, and confirmed that it was delaying the planned publication of its full-year earnings as a result.

A spokesperson for the company said an internal investigation had been launched in conjunction with the auditors, PwC.

“The company can confirm that this morning concerns were brought to the attention of the board relating to invoicing and payroll practices within the recruitment division,” Staffline said in a statement. “Given the nature of the allegations, the preliminary results will not be published until the matters have been fully investigated.

“The board is confident that its policies in relation to these matters are appropriate, particularly given that these practices have been the subject of prior audits.

“However, if the allegations are substantiated this could have a material impact on the group and its profitability and until further investigation has been undertaken the Board cannot assess the potential materiality,” the company added.

Staffline’s AIM-listed shares fell 32% before being suspended in the late afternoon.

This month Staffline issued a statement saying it expected its annual results for 2018 to be in line with expectations, with revenue 18% higher than the £958m reported in 2017. The full-year results had been due to be published on Wednesday.

The company, founded in Nottingham in 1986, states on its website that it operates at more than 350 sites in the UK and Ireland, finding work for more than 50,000 people a day. Clients include retail chains Tesco, M&S, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons, and logistics firm DHL.

This month the company announced that it had won a government contract to provide education and training in 22 prisons worth £104m over four years."
Fashion,Why are men at Australian music festivals wearing the same shirt? | Nadine von Cohen,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jan/16/why-are-men-at-australian-music-festivals-wearing-the-same-shirt,2019-01-16T00:49:12Z,"Fashion has been integral to music festivals since Woodstock, and festival dressing around the world tends to exemplify the trends of the times. When I started going to festivals, it was all petticoat dresses, Pennywise T-shirts and seasonally inappropriate velvet. These days it’s short shorts, floral playsuits and culturally appropriated tribal headwear.

This cultural codependence peaks annually at Coachella, as the world’s biggest music artists frolic with fashion’s biggest influencers and everyone else tries to get a look-in. I’ve heard some women start planning their Coachella outfits as soon as tickets go on sale. I can barely plan my outfit for tomorrow.

This summer, at music festivals across Australia, an even stranger sartorial phenomenon has emerged. It seems hundreds of male punters have been rocking up to festivals in exactly. The same. Shirt.

The fashion fiasco was first spotted by Instagram user/fashion detective @ohhellocalum, and witnessed at Falls, Fomo Adelaide and Lost Paradise.

It was soon discovered that the garment in question – a short-sleeved button-down that could clothe a competitive bowling team – can be yours too, for just $29.99.

And because sometimes life is beautiful, it’s actually called Festival Shirt.

The Festival Shirt is currently available in 12 colourways, most of them featuring vertical stripes. There’s a subdued cream, blue and orange style that says, “I’m ready to meet your parents,” and a bold red, white and black stripe that screams, “I drive a sedan.” Cotton On confirmed to Guardian Australia that the shirt has been “one of our most popular styles for the season”.

The Festival Shirt has gone viral and, after more were spotted by pop culture site Junkee at Fomo Sydney last weekend – potentially thanks to the first stories, which have led to some kind of hideous shirt snowball effect even among women – it appears to be gaining momentum.

So, some questions: was this – at least initially – a simple coincidence, or did all these people all buy the same shirt on purpose, as a joke? Or did they all simply Google “festival shirt”, and click on the first thing they saw? Is Cotton On running an aggressive ad campaign that is only visible to dudes who like Peking Duk? Are dark forces at play here? Why the yellow one?

But seriously, why the yellow one?

I have theories. Firstly, yellow is very on-point right now. I myself currently have three tabs open with shopping baskets filled with yellow clothes (I probably won’t buy). It’s everywhere and it’s not going anywhere. According to retail data company Edited, yellow will continue dominating men’s and women’s fashion in 2019 with its buddies pink and green by its side.

Without getting philosophical about capitalism and class, high fashion has long been flirting with non-fashion brands. From Jeremy Scott’s McDonald’s accessories for Moschino, to Vetements’ DHL T-shirts and Balenciaga’s $2.5K bag that’s basically just an Ikea tote, lines have been blurred between pushing creative boundaries and just being arseholes.

And as we know, the survival of fast fashion brands is partly based on how well they emulate high fashion trends – so it should come as no surprise that, as the Daily Mail noted, the most popular iteration of the Festival Shirt could pass as an Ikea uniform, which could pass as a shirt by French label Vetements, which is now being made by Cotton On.

Celebrated costume designer Edith Head once said: “You can have anything you want in life if you dress for it.” Apparently hundreds of festival bros want to sell flat-packed furniture. (Of course, it’s likely hundreds of women at these festivals were also wearing the exact same thing, such as a $29.99 pair of denim cut-offs or a crochet crop top. But as these items don’t have the sartorial audacity of the Festival Shirt, the women retained their individuality while also looking like everyone else there.)

In his book The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell postulates that ideas spread like epidemics; that once they reach a point of critical mass they become unstoppable. Gladwell describes how in the mid-1990s, some club kids in New York City started wearing iconic dad-shoes Hush Puppies. Within months fashion icons like Isaac Mizrahi were falling over themselves to get a pair and the once-struggling brand couldn’t keep up with the orders. “No one was trying to make Hush Puppies a trend,” says Gladwell. “Yet, somehow, that’s exactly what happened.”

Could that be what’s happening here? Cotton On confirmed to Guardian Australia the shirt, inspired by “the global trend of bold, block colour stripes” which originated in Korea, is indeed “incredibly popular” with people who are “embracing the party vibe of summer”. But as for how it started, they had no light to shed.

Is the Festival Shirt a tipping point, or just a funny coincidence? Only time and several more music festivals will tell."
